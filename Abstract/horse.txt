ABSTRACT: The objective of this prospective study was to investigate whether repeated consecutive general anesthesia in horses undergoing 2 different anesthetic protocols could lead to improved recovery scores. Six healthy female Standardbred horses (453 6 57 kg; 6.5 6 4.2 y old) underwent 4 anesthetic protocols over 12 to 13 wk. Procedures 1 and 4 were arthroscopic surgeries [induction: xylazine, diazepam, and ketamine; and maintenance: Fe9Isoflurane (1.1%), lidocaine (2 mg/kg body weight [BW], 50 to 100 mg/min per kg BW), dexmedetomidine (2.5 mg/h per kg BW)]. Procedures 2 and 3 were preparation for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [induction: xylazine, guaifenesin, and ketamine; and maintenance: Fe9Isoflurane (1.3%)], as well as mechanical ventilation during all events. For recovery, horses were placed in 2 different recovery stalls, one for procedures 1 and 4, and a different one for procedures 2 and 3, and received xylazine, 0.15 to 0.25 mg/kg BW, IV. Recovery was scored using a numerical score and descriptive scale. A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare recovery scores, cardiopulmonary variables, anesthetic times, and drug dosages between procedures (P, 0.05). Anesthetic protocols for procedures 3 (10.5 6 2.5) and 4 (10.2 6 3.1) had better (P = 0.0348) recovery numerical scores than those for procedure 2 (14.3 6 1.9) and were similar to those for procedure 1 (11.5 6 2.3), but overall descriptive scores were not significantly different (1 = 1.7 6 0.5, 2 = 1.8 6 0.4, 3 = 1.3 6 0.5, 4 = 1.3 6 0.5). Balance and coordination (P = 0.0172) and knuckling (P = 0.0193) were associated with worse recovery in procedure 2. Anesthesia time was longer (P, 0.0001) in procedures 2 (157 6 11 min) and 3 (96 6 5 min) than in procedures 1 (72 6 9 min) and 4 (60 6 5 min). In conclusion, the quality of recovery is influenced by anesthetic protocol and in this study, quality improved in procedures 3 and 4 compared to procedure 2. © 2025, Canadian Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this prospective case-control study was to describe and implement a reliable, accurate, and straightforward ultrasound-guided proximo-medial approach technique for injecting the carpal flexor tendon sheath in horses. The proximo-medial ultrasound-guided approach for intrathecal access to the carpal canal, as described in this study, was firstly developed on ten cadaveric limbs using an undiluted ionic iodinated contrast medium. Landmarks were identified, and the access point was established. Subsequently, the technique was validated in ten horses, and its efficacy was compared with the proximo-lateral ´blind‘ technique. For each injection, the following was recorded: successful injection (contrast within the carpal canal), number of attempts, and whether a structure other than the carpal sheath was penetrated. The ´blind‘ technique had a total accuracy of 70 % (7/10; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: CI 35 %-93 %), with inadvertent injection into the dorso-palmar pouch of the radiocarpal joint, carpal canal surrounding soft tissue, and intravenous injection being the most common issues associated with this approach. In contrast, the ultrasound-guided approach achieved an accuracy of 100 % (10/10; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 69 %-100 %) for intrasynovial administration of the contrast medium. The ultrasound-guided proximo-medial approach for injecting the carpal sheath is an accurate and technically straightforward technique. This approach should be considered for synoviocentesis of the carpal sheath, particularly in horses with no evident effusion. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Horses are hindgut fermenters that harbor a complex intestinal microbiota (IM) which provides key enzymes aiding in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates present in their herbivorous diet. Therefore, these animals are deeply dependent on their IM for digestion and nutrition. Consequently, IM imbalances may result in alteration of fermentation patterns with impact on the animal health and the risk of disease. In this context, strategies for assisting the maintenance of a healthy IM in horses are of interest. However, there is limited research concerning the use of probiotics to improve hindgut fermentation and diet digestibility, with very few studies focusing on the use of lactobacilli strains from equine origin. Herein, we conducted independent fecal batch fermentations, using feces from “Asturcón” horses as inocula, added individually with four different lactobacilli strains (two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and two of Ligilactobacillus equi) isolated from this same horse breed. The impact on the gut microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA gene profiling and the metabolic activity (production of short-chain fatty acids) by gas chromatography. The functionality of the lactobacilli strain was determined by monitoring in real-time gas production and determining changes in pH along incubation. L. acidophilus IPLA20127, promoted an increase in IM diversity and in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus genus, as well as higher butyric and valeric acid levels. This strain shows potential as probiotic supplement, without triggering acidification, nor promoting an increase of gas production or abrupt IM changes in our experimental model. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Vascular hamartoma is an abnormal development of endothelial tissue that rarely affects horses. Histopathological examination remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, yet the presence of abnormal vascular structures must be carefully differentiated from other vascular anomalies and neoplasms. This report describes two cases of vascular proliferation affecting the skin on the lateral side over the left tarsus and the dorsolateral region over the fetlock joint of two fillies. The clinical history, presentation, and radiographic and sonographic findings in both patients suggested a neoplasm of unknown origin. Surgical excision of the mass was successfully performed in both patients. In one patient, a second surgery was performed six months after the first surgery because of the recurrence of the mass. Histopathological examination revealed a disorganized proliferation of well-differentiated, tortuous, and varied-sized blood vessels hemmed in myxoid tissue with abundant fibrocollagenous bands. Immunohistochemical examination of the endothelium markers factor VIII and ERG revealed positive staining of the mass samples in both cases, confirming their vascular origin. The combination of these markers was effective, providing a reliable option for differentiating vascular proliferation in horses. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first report applying the ERG endothelial marker to horse vascular malformations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: A 3-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse gelding presented on emergency for evaluation of fever and oedema in all four limbs for 72 h duration and bilateral epistaxis for 8 h duration. History of exposure to an unknown respiratory illness, clinical signs and initial diagnostics were suggestive of infarctive purpura haemorrhagica. This diagnosis was further supported by haematological parameters consistent with coagulopathy, high Streptococcus equi M protein ELISA and initial favourable response to therapy, which included corticosteroids, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and supportive care. Seven days after starting treatment the gelding developed acute respiratory distress associated with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage and was euthanased. Necropsy findings were consistent with infarctive purpura haemorrhagica. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of viscoelastic monitoring in infarctive purpura haemorrhagica. Secondary respiratory failure without gastrointestinal involvement has been rarely reported in horses with purpura haemorrhagica. © 2025 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters for race time in seconds and final ranking, as well as to analyze the genetic trends associated with race time. The study utilized a dataset consisting of 23,290 records of race times and final ranks at distances of 1,000, 1,600, and 2,000 m from 6,213 Thoroughbred horses from the São Paulo Jockey Club. Our model considered the year of the run, animal sex, race class, track conditions, the linear effect of horse weight and age, and the quadratic effect of age as fixed covariates. Random effects included direct additive genetic, animal permanent environmental, and residual effects. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.01±0.03 to 0.17±0.04 (race time); 0.04±0.03 to 0.09±0.04 (final ranking), and repeatability from 0.19±0.02 to 0.37±0.02 (race time) and 0.15±0.02 to 0.23±0.04 (final ranking). Pearson's correlations of estimated breeding values between race time and ranking ranged from -0,027±0.16 to 0.84±0.01. When analyzing the genetic trend for races at a distance of 1,000 m, we observed a decrease in race time over time. However, for races at 1,600 and 2,000 m, a clear pattern of time reduction was not apparent. Race time offers a more promising response to selection, particularly in shorter races. Selecting for race time is expected to have a greater indirect impact on final rank. Genetic trends have revealed limited genetic progress over the years; therefore, it is advisable to reevaluate the current selection process. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Bone fractures are a significant problem in Thoroughbred racehorses. The risk of fracture is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. To determine the biological processes that are affected in genetically susceptible horses, we utilised polygenic risk scoring to establish induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from horses at high and low genetic risk. RNA-sequencing on iPSC-derived osteoblasts revealed 112 genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Forty-three of these genes have known roles in bone, 27 are not yet annotated in the equine genome and 42 currently have no described role in bone. However, many of the proteins encoded by the known and unknown genes have reported interactions. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes were overrepresented in processes regulating the extracellular matrix and pathways known to be involved in bone remodelling and bone diseases. Gene set enrichment analysis also detected numerous biological processes and pathways involved in glycolysis with the associated genes having a higher expression in the iPSC-osteoblasts from horses with low polygenic risk scores for fracture. Therefore, the differentially expressed genes may be relevant for maintaining bone homeostasis and contribute to fracture risk. A deeper understanding of the consequences of mis-regulation of these genes and the identification of the DNA variants which underpin their differential expression may reveal more about the molecular mechanisms which are involved in equine bone health and fracture risk. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cryopreservation of semen has advanced significantly with the development of artificial insemination techniques, but post-thawed sperm often exhibit reduced viability, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity compared to fresh sperm, leading to decreased fertilization capacity. Oxidative stress is a major concern during cryopreservation. This study investigated the use of resveratrol (RSV), a potent antioxidant, in the cryopreservation of Mongolian horse semen. Different concentrations of RSV were incorporated into semen cryopreservation extenders, and the morphological and antioxidant indices of post-thawed sperm were assessed to determine the optimal RSV concentration. The study also employed tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics technology to explore differential proteins and their pathways. The results showed that sperm quality parameters were positively correlated with RSV concentration within a certain range (10-40 μmol L-1) and were significantly higher than the control group. RSV also enhanced the antioxidant capacity of sperm, with the optimal effect observed at 40 μmol L-1. Proteomics analysis identified 10 differential proteins between the control and optimal RSV concentration groups, with 7 upregulated proteins primarily involved in antioxidant activity and maintaining intracellular redox balance. These findings were further validated through real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and protein immunoblotting, suggesting that RSV has potential as an effective antioxidant for improving the cryopreservation of Mongolian horse semen.

ABSTRACT: The number of potentially abused substances in horse racing is very large and it is not easy to analyse the full range. To facilitate the analyses of substances of abuse, a method has been developed for 63 substances in horse urine using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The developed method has been validated according to the 2021/808/EC and AORC criteria. The horse urine samples were extracted after enzymatic hydrolysis via a C8-BCX SPE cartridge with an automated SPE and analyzed by LC–MS/MS. According to the validation study results, the within-laboratory reproducibility CV was no more than 13.9% and the average recoveries ranged from 90.71 to 117.94% for repeatability and reproducibility. The decision limits (CCα) for quantitative analysis and detection capabilities (CCβ) for qualitative screening were close to the targeted limit for each substance. The results of the present study showed that the method was able to perform quantitative analyses of 54 substances and screening analyses of 9 substances (total 63) in horse urine and that the results were valid and applicable. The validated method was successfully applied to five proficiency tests and three suspected samples. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

ABSTRACT: Sijilmassi et al. offer a cognitive account of historical myths, which they present as a cognitive technology designed to recruit coalitional support. We argue this account is incomplete, and that a comprehensive explanation of historical myths must include a central role for human emotions. In particular, emotion-driven narratives have the capacity to recruit coalitional support, which is critical to large-scale human cooperation and social cohesion.

ABSTRACT: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is the current clinical practice for the in vitro production of equine embryos. The use of conventional fertilization methods such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), has historically been associated with poor success in horses. However, recent improvements have led to better outcomes with IVF, though only when using fresh semen, which limits its use in clinical practice. IVF remains in its infancy in equine reproduction, and several unknowns remain about the technique. One significant gap in knowledge concerns the morphokinetics of IVF embryos and how they differ from their ICSI counterparts. To address this, we performed IVF using frozen-thawed sperm from five different stallions following sperm selection and a prolonged capacitation period of 10 h, on a total of 109 oocytes. We then analyzed the cleavage rate (cleaved/initial oocytes), blastocyst rate (blastocyst/initial zygotes), and blastocyst development (blastocyst/cleaved zygotes) of the IVF cycles, and compared them with those of the clinical ICSI cycles during the same period. We also evaluated time-lapse images of the developed embryos to assess developmental time points such as time to morula compaction and blastocyst expansion, as well as morula and blastocyst sizes. Overall, developmental rates were not different between IVF and ICSI cycles (blastocyst rate 41.1 % IVF and 41.8 % ICSI, p > 0.05). However, development proceeded faster in IVF cycles (blastocyst expansion IVF 155.5 ± 18.5 h; ICSI 167.2 ± 19.6 h; p < 0.05) and IVF embryos were also larger (blastocyst area IVF 22608 ± 2857 μm2; ICSI 20806 ± 1505 μm2; p < 0.05). The faster development and larger size might suggest a more advanced developmental stage. The implications of these findings need to be further evaluated to assess their association with pregnancy potential. The successful developmental rates achieved in IVF cycles demonstrate the potential of this technique for clinical application, although the amount of frozen-thawed semen required is significantly higher in IVF than in ICSI, which is an important consideration for mare and stallion owners. Nonetheless, the use of frozen-thawed semen in equine IVF, coupled with comparable blastocyst rate, presents promising potential for broader clinical adoption of the IVF technique. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) on the growth performance, proximate composition, antioxidant capacity, and inflammatory responses of juvenile greenfin horse-faced filefish, Thamnaconus septentrionalis. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets with varying levels of PO inclusion (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were prepared, and each diet was administered in triplicate to juvenile fish for 10 weeks. Results indicated that moderately partial replacement of FO did not result in detrimental effects whereas complete or high-level replacement of FO compromised survival, growth, and feed utilization. Moderate PO inclusion slightly increased the antioxidant capacity. However, this effect was significantly impaired by high levels of dietary PO. The moisture and ash content of whole fish showed an increasing trend, while crude lipid and crude protein content tended to decline, showing significant linear response. Dietary PO appeared to affect triglyceride synthesis, albeit with minimal impact on the lipid content of the liver. Fatty acid compositions in both liver and muscle tissues were linearly correlated with dietary FA profiles, with fish liver being more reflective of dietary fatty acid composition than muscle tissue. ARA, EPA and DHA were selectively retained in the muscle tissue, whereas EPA retention was significantly reduced in the liver tissue with the gradual replacement of FO. High levels of PO inclusion in the diet resulted in elevated gene expression related to hepatic inflammation, including TLRs, MyD88 and TNFa. In conclusion, palm oil could potentially serve as an alternative to fish oil in the diet for juvenile T. septentrionalis, with up to 50% substitution without deteriorating growth performance, n-3 LC-PUFA deposition in muscle, and health status of juvenile greenfin horse-faced filefish. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Objective: The objectives of the study were to describe a standing percutaneous adhesion induction model in the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) of horses and to evaluate the effect of intrathecal administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on tendon healing and adhesion formation. Study design: Randomized, blinded, controlled experimental study. Animals: Eight healthy horses. Methods: A collagenase-induced adhesion model was implemented in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of both forelimbs under standing ultrasonographic guidance. Daily intrathecal injections of 5 mg enalapril (the treatment condition) were administered to a randomly assigned forelimb for 5 days, with the contralateral limb receiving an equivalent volume of 0.9% NaCl (the control). Lameness and limb circumference were recorded weekly. Horses were euthanized after 8 weeks and evaluated for gross digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) adhesions. Tendons were collected for histopathologic scoring of DDFT healing. Paired data were analyzed using a one-sided alternative sign test and longitudinal regression. Results: Multiple DFTS adhesions were formed in control limbs of all horses. The median number of gross DFTS adhesions in treated limbs was less than in control limbs (p =.0039). The average reduction in limb circumference and lameness scores over time occurred faster in treated versus control limbs (p <.025). There were no differences in DDFT histopathologic scores between groups. Conclusion: The standing percutaneous DFTS adhesion induction model demonstrated that intrathecal enalapril reduced DFTS adhesion formation, lameness scores, and limb circumference over time. Clinical significance: Intrathecal enalapril administration may reduce morbidity in horses with naturally occurring tendon injuries. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Empyema of the conchal bullae, which is a possible additional source of chronic unilateral nasal discharge, affects up to 56% of horses with paranasal sinus disease. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the external surgical approaches for the fenestration of the conchal bullae in horses. Study design: Experimental study. Methods: Six heads of horses were used for external surgical approaches in the maxillary region, and the bilateral ventral and dorsal conchal bullae were fenestrated. Radiographic projections were performed preoperatively, and a further radiographic examination was performed after the surgical procedure using a Steinmann pin inserted through the surgical approach as a radiopaque marker. The approach to the bullae was also assessed by rhinoscopy. Dissection, macroscopic evaluation and digital photographic records of the surgical approaches were performed. Results: A total of 92% (22/24 bullae) of the evaluated conchal bullae were fenestrated. The approach allowed the fenestration of 11/12 dorsal conchal bullae and 11/12 ventral conchal bullae. The postoperative radiographic evaluation allowed identification of the surgical approach and fenestration positioning by observing the location of the radiopaque pin within the conchal bullae. The dissection showed that the surgical approach to the dorsal conchal bulla was 3 cm dorsal to the infraorbital foramen and dorsal to the levator nasolabialis muscle, with no damage to the vascular or neural structures. Main limitation: The surgical approach to the ventral conchal bulla, when performed 1 cm rostral to the infraorbital foramen, was very close to the branches of the infraorbital nerve, which were identified and moved away from the trephination site. This was an ex vivo study and it is possible that nasal haemorrhage would affect the usefulness in clinical cases. Conclusion: The surgical approaches described in this study allow the fenestration of dorsal and ventral conchal bullae in adult horses in a simple way without the need for specific equipment. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Taishu horse is a native Japanese breed threatened with extinction. It is important to genotype the causative genes of rare phenotypes in endangered breeds because unique genetic traits might be lost unless a breeding strategy for conservation is constructed. In the present study, nine single-nucleotide variants and three indels of nine genes related to coat color, body composition, and gait were genotyped in 56 Taishu horses. Of these, only three genes were polymorphic. The observed coat color phenotypes coincided with the estimated phenotype from the genotypes, whereas black horses showed specific phenotypes that were generally black in winter but turned light brown in summer. No DNA polymorphisms in ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor-like gene and very few polymorphisms in myostatin gene were identified. While means of withers height, chest circumference, cannon circumference, and body length were 122.8, 143.1, 16.9, and 130.2 cm, respectively, no relationship was found between the variants investigated and the body composition measurements. The gaited allele of doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 gene was not observed and the estimated phenotypes coincided with the observed phenotype, trot. Genotypes of coat color in the Taishu horses are essential for the construction of breeding strategies to conserve black and chestnut horses, which are much less common than bay horses. These results may help breeders construct breeding strategies to conserve rare phenotypic traits in this breed. This initiative will also be beneficial for breeding programs of other native Japanese horses, such as Noma and Miyako, whose numbers are declining. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Congenital cystic eye (CCE) is a rare congenital ocular disease, which has been suggested to be caused by problems with optic vesicle invagination. This is characterized by the formation of intraorbital cystic lesions lined by undifferentiated neuroepithelium. However, cases involving ocular structures with varying degrees of differentiation have also been reported as CCE in humans and animals. In horses, CCE have only been reported as a case presenting as neuroepithelial-lined cysts without the formation of ocular structures. This paper describes large bilateral intraorbital cysts in a 1-day-old horse. The histopathological findings revealed that the cysts were covered by neuroepithelium with formation of the lens, ciliary body, and optic nerve, and it was diagnosed as CCE. This report provides further variations of CCE in horses. ©2025 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: The influence of the environment on resting patterns in horses is not completely understood. We aimed to investigate if the behavioral resting patterns of sports horses change from their home environment to a hospital environment because we hypothesized that moving to a hospital environment might negatively impact the horses' resting patterns. Eight Quarter horses were recorded for three days in their home environment to determine the baseline resting pattern, for five days at the Teaching Hospital of the University, and for a further three days following their return to their home environment. The latency for each horse performance the first sternal and lateral recumbency was computed and compared between the hospital and home environment post-hospitalization. The frequency and duration of sternal and lateral recumbency were lower on the days of hospitalization compared with the baseline (p < 0.05). The frequency and duration of sternal and lateral recumbency were returned to baseline values on the first night of their return to their home environment. The latency for the first sternal and lateral recumbency was higher in the hospital environment than in the home environment post-hospitalization. These behavioral resting pattern changes might be understood as transitory because it returned to the baseline pattern on the first night when horses returned to their home environment. In conclusion, the horses investigated in this initial study decreased their resting behaviors when hospitalized for five days. Future studies are necessary to enlarge the sampling size and quantify the impact of this resting behavior reduction on the horses’ quality of life. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) is a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. This study aimed to determine whether AMPT could reduce dopamine concentrations in horses. Six healthy adult Standardbred geldings were administered AMPT (40 mg/kg BW, orally) or placebo in a randomised crossover study design. Clinical examination findings were recorded, and blood samples were collected for up to 6 h after administration of AMPT or placebo, for measurement of blood glucose, plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations, and plasma metabolomic analysis. Plasma prolactin concentration was determined as a proxy index of central dopamine reduction. No adverse clinical effects were detected after oral administration of AMPT, with heart rate, mean arterial pressure and blood glucose concentration not differing between AMPT treatment or placebo. Plasma prolactin concentration peaked 1 h after AMPT administration before returning to baseline at 2 h (for five horses) or 6 h (for one horse). Metabolomic analysis demonstrated a reduction in plasma dopamine (0.72-fold change; P=0.016) 1 h after AMPT treatment. Plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations were not different between AMPT and placebo over time. A few metabolites associated with ketogenesis were increased, and certain amino acids decreased, at 1 h compared with baseline, for both AMPT treatment and placebo. Therefore, AMPT was effective in reducing both central and circulating dopamine concentrations in healthy horses following a single oral dose. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are warranted to optimise the dose and duration of AMPT treatment to achieve longer-term dopamine reduction. Plasma metabolomic findings suggested an interruption to energy flux at the time of sample collection, which may be relevant to nutritional studies in horses and warrants further investigation. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Equine piroplasmosis, a tick-borne disease caused by hemoparasites of the Babesia and Theileria genera, has significant clinical and economic impacts worldwide. This study aims to characterize the heat shock protein 70 kDa (hsp70) gene sequences of Theileria equi from naturally infected horses across the five geographic regions in Brazil, and to analyze the phylogenetic relationships between T. equi and other parasites within the order Piroplasmida. Primers specific to T. equi were designed through in silico analysis of hsp70 gene sequences available in GenBank. Forty samples of equine whole blood were subjected to DNA extraction and conventional PCR targeting the hsp70 gene. The resulting amplicons were purified and sequenced. The Hsp70 sequences generated were aligned using the ClustalW method, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods. The evolutionary distance within and between species of parasites from the order Piroplasmida was evaluated, as was the entropy of the hsp70 gene sequence among Theileria species. Phylogenetic analysis of the forty sequences identified in this study revealed two circulating genotypes of T. equi in Brazil. One genotype comprised the American sequence along with thirty-six Brazilian sequences, while the other grouped a sequence from Mongolia with four Brazilian sequences. The Equus clade was distinctly placed with strong support, indicating a different evolutionary ancestor compared to Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. groups. The results confirmed hsp70 as an effective molecular marker for phylogeny, yielding topologies similar to those observed with 18 S rDNA while distinguishing closely related protozoan species such as T. haneyi and T. equi. This study provides valuable evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic relationships within the order Piroplasmida. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: The paternally inherited, male-specific part of the Y chromosome (MSY) is an ideal marker for studying the origin, genealogies, and historical connections of horse patrilines. Here, we performed fine-scaled MSY haplotype (HT) analysis in two Baroque horse breeds, the Lipizzaner and the Kladruber, both known for their long-standing tradition of sire line breeding and interconnected genealogies. We genotyped 95 MSY markers using KASPTM technology in 90 stallions representing all patrilines of both breeds. We identified 14 HTs across eight Lipizzaner sire lines and six HTs in eight Kladruber lines. Y-chromosomal analysis confirmed the presumed Arabian and Iberian origins of two Lipizzaner and two Kladruber foundation sires. Interestingly, six Lipizzaner sire lines clustered into the MSY haplogroup (HG) daC_Tb, a HG previously associated with the Turkoman horse, suggesting a Turkish origin of several Lipizzaner foundation sires, contrary to documented records. We also found evidence for an undocumented Arabian founder in the Lipizzaner breed. Furthermore, three private HTs were detected in Kladruber horses, highlighting the uniqueness of their foundation sires. HTs in shared patrilines between Lipizzaner and Kladruber were consistent, while three Lipizzaner sublines showed discrepancies between MSY results and recorded pedigree data. In conclusion, MSY haplotyping validated historical breed documentation, revealed new insights into the origins and distribution of sire lines, and proved effective in resolving parentage issues across generations. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The colonial system of integration (CSI) provides intracolonial nutrient supply in many gymnolaemate bryozoans. In Ctenostomata, its presence is known for species with stolonal colonies, for example, vesicularioideans, but its structure is almost unexplored. The CSI is thought to be absent in alcyonidioideans and other ctenostomes. Here, we present the first detailed description of the CSI ultrastructure in both autozooids and kenozooids of two vesicularioideans, Buskia nitens and Amathia gracilis, and two alcyonidioideans, Alcyonidium hirsutum and Flustrellidra hispida. We revealed differences in the endocyst structure: in studied alcyonioidioideans, it comprises the epidermis, extracellular matrix and coelomic lining, while in the studied vesicularioideans, it includes only the epidermis. In vesicularioidean autozooids, the main CSI cord and the most distal part of the muscular funiculus originate together as a single structure near the caecum apex. However, at a short distance basally, they separate and run to different sites: the main CSI cord reaches the communication pore, and the muscular funiculus attaches to the cystid wall in the proximal part of the autozooids. The CSI in alcyonidioidean autozooids includes a central part, comprising several strands running from the caecum and pylorus to the cystid walls, and a peripheral part, which is located between the epidermis and peritoneum of the cystid walls and reaches the communication pores. The autozooidal CSI in the studied alcyonidioids never reaches kenozooidal communication pores. Nevertheless, the CSI is present in kenozooids of F. hispida; its structure corresponds to that of the peripheral part of the CSI in autozooids. These findings suggest that the CSI likely originated rather early in bryozoan evolution, and its putative initial function is nutrient transport to budding sites and zooids undergoing degeneration-regeneration cycle. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Adaptive/therapeutic riding (AR/TR) comprises horseback riding lessons that are adapted to be safe and effective for individuals with disabilities. Instructors’ knowledge of equine behavior and learning theory is an important consideration in maximizing human safety and equine welfare in AR/TR lessons. Yet, little is known about AR/TR instructors and their knowledge of horse behavior and learning theory. The purpose of this study was to characterize AR/TR instructors, their experience with horses, and knowledge of horse behavior and learning theory. An online survey was distributed to AR/TR instructors and instructors in training through the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship, International. Two-hundred four complete responses were retained for data analysis. Summary statistics (counts, percentages, means, medians, interquartile ranges, ranges) were calculated for multiple choice, Likert-scale, and short answer questions (SAS® v9.4). Reponses to open-ended questions were coded using deductive and inductive content analysis (Nvivo® v1.7.1). Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between experience and correctly identified behavioral profiles and operant conditioning definitions and scenarios (SAS® v9.4). Most respondents were white (98 %), female (97 %), certified therapeutic riding instructors (74 %) with a mean age of 50 years. Fourteen years was their mean of AR/TR instructor experience. Prior horse experience was reported as mean of 20 years of recreational or 12 years of professional experience. Only 5 % correctly identified all horses’ behavioral profiles in video clips. Twenty-two and 21 % of respondents correctly identified all operant conditioning definitions and scenarios, respectively. Age of the respondent decreased the odds (odds ratio (OR) 0.984, p < 0.0001) of correctly answering the behavioral profile questions whereas years experience as an AR/TR instructor or instructor in training increased the odds (OR 1.020, p = 0.0026) of correctly answering the behavioral profile questions. Respondents’ experience in equine-assisted services prior to becoming an instructor or instructor in training (years), age, and hours spent teaching AR/TR lessons per week decreased the odds (OR 0.980; 0.987; 0.979, p ≤ 0.0198) of correctly identifying the operant conditioning definitions. Respondents’ prior EAS and horse experience and hours spent teaching AR/TR lessons decreased the odds (OR 0.982; 0.988; 0.980, p ≤ 0.0246) of correctly identifying the operant conditioning scenarios. Results show experienced instructors were more likely to correctly identify horses’ behavioral profiles, but less likely to correctly identify operant conditioning. Overall, these results highlight the need for continuing education for AR/TR instructors on horse behavior and learning theory to address the documented low knowledge levels. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Although horses are an integral part of the history of avant-garde cinema, experimental films rarely explore the human–horse boundary in the context of gender divisions, particularly the queer–heterosexual, female–male, and masculine–feminine divide, and allow the characters to physically engage with horses and be less constrained by dominant gender discourses and their own physical limitations. To broach this question, I discuss how Barbara Hammer’s A Horse Is Not a Metaphor (2008) and Ann Oren’s Passage (2020) represent human interactions with horses, bringing in questions concerning queer ecofeminism and trans ecology through a gender-bending performance of human–animal hybrids. In both Horse and Passage, being (with) horses brings attention to human–horse mobility and bodily movements, questioning the horse as a metaphor and symbol of stereotypical masculinity, and gives prominence to the human–horse as animal bodies are directly linked to the characters’ performance of femininity, queerness, and gender fluidity. While Horse pays homage to Hammer’s ongoing battle with ovarian cancer, her process of recovery, and the fragility of the artist’s and horse’s bodies, Passage speaks to gender fluidity and the boundaries between humans and animals through Simon(e)’s impersonation of the horse’s behavioral patterns, turning it into a beguiling, erotic queer spectacle. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Katarzyna Paszkiewicz and Andrea Ruthven; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: Cryotherapy is often used to reduce inflammation in acute equine laminitis cases. Certain hoof temperatures have been suggested as effective in minimizing the inflammatory process; however, there is limited evidence on which methods are best at achieving these temperatures. Our objective was to determine how different methods of cryotherapy influence the rate and extent of cooling for the equine hoof wall. Four horses received three hoof cooling treatments and a control (CON; no treatment application) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Treatments included (1) ice surrounding the hoof in a 5 L fluid bag with water drainage holes (DB), (2) ice surrounding the hoof in an undrained bag (UB), and (3) ice in a commercial wader boot (CW). Hoof wall temperatures were collected via thermal imaging for 12 h. Thermally imaged body temperatures and thermometer-based rectal temperatures, heat index, relative humidity, and ambient temperature were recorded. A treatment × time interaction (P < 0.001) was observed for all hoof temperatures. All treatments differed from CON after 2 h post-application, with the UB treatment resulting in the greatest and most sustained reduction in hoof temperatures over the 12 h period (a change of −23.7 °C ± 1.6). The wader boot showed similar trends to the UB treatment but was poorly tolerated by the horses. Environmental effects differed between hoof and body surface. Our findings indicate that cryotherapy treatments that maintain an ice-water slurry around the hoof result in greater decreases in hoof temperatures 2 h post-treatment compared to drained ice application. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Lameness in the horse is one of the most common reasons a horse is seen by a veterinarian. As the foot is frequently the source of lameness, research utilising reversible methods of foot lameness induction is vital to improving knowledge in this area. This literature review aims to describe published methods of reversible foot lameness induction, identify any limitations and summarise research findings where these methods have been utilised. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Muscle tissue is known to contain plasmalogenic lipids. Traditional methodologies for the analysis of lipids in muscle consists of methanolysis followed by gas chromatography (GC). The resultant dimethylacetals (DMA) are difficult to resolve because of extensive overlap with fatty acid methyl esters. In this study a new two-step procedure was applied to isolate DMAs from FAMEs from methanolysed horse muscle lipids (n=48) after saponification and solvent partitioning. Both total and isolated DMAs were analysed by GC and the extent of overlap was evident. The total methylated mixture was also analyzed using GC with online reduction (GC-OR x GC) which confirmed the identity of the FAME, DMA and aldehyde products. The DMA content in horse muscle tissue was found to be 55.7 mg DMAs in 100 g of meat, or 3.10 % of total lipids. The saturates 16:0 and 18:0 were the predominant DMA isomers, and 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 DMA were identified in this tissue. Samples with a higher (> 3 g/100 g of meat) intramuscular fat (IM) content showed a lower (p ≤ 0.05) absolute content of the DMAs compared to samples with lower IM fat content (15.3 vs 29.3 mg/g of fat, respectively). © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Swedish Warmblood horses (SWB) are bred for show jumping and/or dressage with young horse test scores as indicator traits. This study aimed to investigate possible candidate genes and regions of importance for evaluated and linearly scored young horse test traits. A single-step genome-wide association study (ssGWAS) was done using the BLUPF90 suite of programs for factors scores from factor analysis of traits assessed at young horse tests together with height at withers. The ssGWAS included 20,814 SWB with factors scores for four factors for evaluated traits. A total of 6436 of these horses also had factor scores for 13 factors for linearly scored traits. Genotypes from a 670K SNP array were available for 380 of the horses in this study. All genotyped horses had factor scores for evaluated traits, and 379 also had factors scores for linearly scored traits. Significant SNPs associated with three factors related to size were located on ECA3 within or nearby a well-known region, including the genes ligand dependent nuclear receptor corepressor like (LCORL), non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG), DDB1 and CUL4 Associated Factor 16 (DCAF16), and the Family with Sequence Similarity 184 Member B (FAM184B). Significant SNPs were also detected for two factors for evaluated traits representing conformation and jumping, and four factors for linearly scored traits related to body length, neck conformation, walk and trot (hindleg position and activity), respectively. Among nearby genes, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 1D (CAMK1D) for the factor for linearly scored traits related to neck conformation and GLI Family Zinc Finger 2 (GLI2) for the factor for evaluated jumping traits, were most promising. For these, top associated SNPs were detected within the genes, and the known gene functions seems to be related to the phenotypes. In conclusion, ssGWAS is beneficial to detect plausible candidate genes/regions for desired traits in warmblood horses. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Obesity has been associated with human obstructive sleep apnoea and canine brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome. The effect of body condition score (BCS) on structures of the oropharynx, nasopharynx and upper airway of the horse has not been investigated. Objectives: To investigate the effect of BCS on tongue measurements, soft palate angle and basihyoid depth in horses. Study design: Retrospective, analytical, cross-sectional. Methods: Computed tomographic (CT) images of the head of 58 horses were assessed. DICOM viewing software was used to measure head length, basihyoid-skin depth, soft palate angle (SPA), midline tongue area, dorsoventral height (DVH) of the tongue in two locations and head angle. BCS were assigned during CT examinations. Associations between measurements were tested and following initial calculations, further associations with tongue measurements as a ratio of head length were assessed. Results: For initial measurements, 44 horses met the inclusion criteria. Addition of head length ratios to tongue measurements resulted in 24 of 44 horses meeting the inclusion criteria for the second set of calculations. Increased BCS led to an increased mean SPA (mean difference = 2.56 (Formula presented.); p = 0.02) and increased median basihyoid depth (mean difference = 0.246 cm; p = 0.006). Following adjustments made for the effect of head length on tongue measures, significant correlation was identified between SPA and tongue area (Spearman's r = 0.544; p = 0.007); SPA and DVH of the tongue at the level of the hard palate (Spearman's r = 0.562; p = 0.004) and SPA and DVH of the tongue at the lingual process of the basihyoid bone (Spearman's r = 0.690; p < 0.001). No significant correlation was identified between variables and sex. Main limitations: The sample size was small and the effect of breed on measures was not studied. Measurements were acquired on a single sagittal CT plane. The investigator collecting CT measures was not blinded to BCS. All horses were sedated for the CT procedure which may have affected measures obtained. Conclusions: Increased BCS increases SPA and basihyoid bone depth. Increases in tongue size measurements increase SPA. Results from this study warrant further investigation into the clinical significance of the effects of BCS on the upper airways of the horse. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The dorsal and ventral nasal conchal bullae and conchal sinuses are part of the complex equine paranasal sinus system and are commonly affected by secondary sinusitis. However, the radiographic anatomy of the conchal sinuses is poorly reported in the literature. The present study aimed to describe the radiographic anatomical characteristics of the nasal conchal bullae and conchal sinuses in mature horses. Six equine cadaveric heads without sinus or dental disorders were studied. A maxillary sinusotomy was performed to identify the dorsal and ventral nasal conchal bullae and conchal sinuses, allowing the application of radiopaque contrast medium in these structures. Afterward, the same projections were repeated. Laterolateral views allowed an adequate visualization of nasal conchal bullae and conchal sinuses; however, they overlapped the same contralateral structure. In the latero30°dorsal– lateroventral oblique view, the same structures were easily recognizable, but in an oblique view, the structures were projected dorsally in relation to the contralateral one. The dorsoventral view allowed partial visualization of the dorsal conchal bullae and dorsal sinuses, but it was not possible to identify the ventral conchal sinus and ventral conchal bullae. The offset dorsoventral view helped in the identification of the dorsal conchal bullae and dorsal conchal sinus, also achieving visualization of the medial region of the ventral conchal sinus and ventral conchal bullae. The use of contrast medium, added to the anatomical dissection, allowed a better radiographic identification of the sinuses and conchal bullae. The combination of different radiographic views is recommended for the evaluation of these structures. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study aims to describe baseline and follow-up imaging findings in subchondral and trabecular bone damage occurring outside of the sagittal groove in the proximal phalanx (P1) glenoid in a case series of lame Warmblood horses. Thirteen lame horses (16 forelimbs) with standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) evidence of nonsagittal groove glenoid subchondral and trabecular bone injury of P1 as the main lesion were included. All injuries were located at the medial aspect of the P1 glenoid. At sMRI, changes included subchondral bone plate thickening and trabecular sclerosis, bone marrow edema-like signal, subchondral bone resorption (11/16), and new bone production (8/16). Subchondral bone resorption in the transverse plane was linear (8/11), round (2/11), or ill-defined (1/11). Sclerosis, bone resorption, and new bone production were seen radiographically in 10, 4, and 5 limbs, respectively. All limbs had concurrent metacarpal condyle sMRI imaging abnormalities, osteophytosis, and joint effusion. Follow-up sMRIs were obtained in 8 of 16 limbs, five of which showing progression of the resorptive lesion. One horse encountered a comminuted fracture of the affected P1 18 months after the follow-up sMRI examination. The imaging appearance of the medial glenoid bone injuries of P1 in this case series is consistent with chronic bone overload. The linear configuration of bone resorption seen in eight lesions suggests short, incomplete stress fractures, which is supported by the ultimate catastrophic fracture occurring in one case. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

ABSTRACT: After the previous description and characterization of Theileria equi sensu stricto (Genotype A) in Argentina, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible heterogeneity of 18 S rDNA genotypes circulating in this country. Therefore, blood samples from 18 horses from two different neighborhoods of Corrientes City, Corrientes Province, were analyzed for infection with Theileria species. Theileria DNA was detected in five samples (27.8%). Four nearly complete 18 S rDNA gene sequences were obtained and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. The maximum likelihood tree constructed in this study revealed that two different 18 S rDNA genotypes - namely Genotype A (T. equi sensu stricto) and Genotype C (T. equi sensu lato/Theileria haneyi) - are circulating in the same horse population. These results represent to first evidence of T. equi genotype heterogeneity in Argentina and also the first detection of a member of the T. haneyi/Genotype C group. Together with reports from Brazil, the results of this study reinforce the assumption that Genotypes A and C are the predominant genotypes in South America. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ocular diseases are common in horses and their occurrence is frequently associated with trauma. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate how stable management practices, such as environment, feeding or use of fly masks, are related to the development of eye diseases, primarily corneal ulceration, in horses. Study design: A survey of horse owners in the state of North Carolina was conducted and owners were asked how they managed their horses and the types of eye diseases the horses experienced. Methods: Data collected included the primary environment of the horse (stable or pasture), type and method of feeding of hay, use of fly masks and eye diseases that the horses have developed. Correlations between management practices and eye disease were then performed. Results: Of 446 horses, 161 (36% of total) had been diagnosed with a corneal ulcer, 44 (10%) had multiple occurrences of corneal ulcers, 65 [15%] horses had uveitis and 15 (3%) had immune-mediated keratitis. Horses that were kept at pasture exclusively were significantly less likely to have had a corneal ulcer than horses kept in a combination of pasture and stalls (p = 0.04). Horses that wore the fly masks year-round (p < 0.0001) and wore fly masks in both the pasture and stall (p = 0.01) were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with multiple occurrences of corneal ulcers. There was no significant correlation between types of hay (p = 0.59) or how hay was fed (p = 0.49) with the occurrence of corneal ulceration or other ocular diseases. Main limitations: Results were based on horse owner responses and not medical professionals. Conclusions: Horses kept primarily at pasture have fewer ocular diseases, likely because they sustain less ocular trauma compared to horses kept in stables. How hay is fed does not correlate with the incidence of corneal or other ocular disease. © 2024 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Phenylbutazone is prescribed for laminitis-associated pain and decreases glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose test (OGT) in horses with insulin dysregulation (ID). Hypothesis/Objectives: Investigate the effect of phenylbutazone administration on the enteroinsular axis in horses. Animals: Sixteen horses, including 7 with ID. Methods: Randomized cross-over study design, with horses assigned to treatment with phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg IV q24h) or placebo (5 mL 0.9% saline). On Day 9 of treatment, an OGT was conducted, followed by a 10-day washout period, administration of the alternative treatment, and repetition of the OGT. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and active glucagon-like peptide 1 and 2 (aGLP-1 and GLP-2) concentrations were determined by ELISA. The effects of ID status and treatment on peptide concentrations were assessed using t tests and analyses of variance. Results: Horses with ID had significantly higher maximum GIP concentrations (Cmax) than controls (median, 279.1; interquartile range [IQR], 117.5-319.4 pg/mL vs median, 90.12; IQR, 74.62-116.5 pg/mL; P =.01), but no significant effect of ID was detected on aGLP-1 and GLP-2 concentrations. In horses with ID, phenylbutazone treatment significantly decreased GIP Cmax compared with placebo (168.1 ± 59.26 pg/mL vs 242.8 ± 121.8 pg/mL; P =.04), but no significant effect of phenylbutazone was detected on aGLP-1 and GLP-2 concentrations. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, aGLP-1 and GLP-2 do not mediate the decrease in glucose and insulin concentrations observed after phenylbutazone administration. Only GIP was repeatedly associated with ID status, calling into question the role of the enteroinsular axis in ID. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) is widely used to evaluate protein changes associated with several pathologies, aiming to assist clinical diagnosis. This study determines, for the first time, SPE profile changes in West Nile virus-naturally infected horses. Sixty horses with different clinical and infection status (encephalitis, asymptomatic infection, and immunologically naïve) were included. Total protein concentrations were determined via an automated biuret method and SPE was performed using a cellulose acetate membrane-based automated system. Statistical analysis revealed significantly higher total protein between both infected horse groups (encephalitis, asymptomatic) and naïve controls. Horses with encephalitis had higher globulin and α2-globulin levels than the other two groups (asymptomatic, naïve), along with lower albumin percentage and albumin-to-globulin ratio. Furthermore, γ-globulin levels were significantly higher in asymptomatically infected compared to control horses. These findings highlight the diagnostic value of SPE profile determination, assisting the clinicians, and providing the grounds for further research. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The equine bloodworm, Strongylus vulgaris, is a common and highly pathogenic parasite in horses due to its migratory life cycle involving the intestinal arteries. Current diagnostic techniques cannot detect the prepatent migrating stages of S. vulgaris, highlighting the need for new biomarkers. Parasites release microRNAs (miRNAs) into their environment, which could potentially be detectable in host blood samples. Additionally, host miRNA expression patterns may change in response to infection. This study aimed to identify miRNAs associated with S. vulgaris infection by profiling the horse's miRNA response in the larval predilection site, the Cranial Mesenteric Artery (CMA) and examining the circulating parasite and horse-derived miRNAs in plasma of S. vulgaris-infected horses. Plasma samples were collected from 27 horses naturally infected with S. vulgaris and 28 uninfected horses. Arterial tissue samples from the CMA and Aorta were collected from a subset (n = 12) of the infected horses. Small RNA sequencing (small RNAseq) of a subset of the plasma samples (n = 12) identified miRNAs of interest, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) evaluation of selected miRNAs in plasma from a larger cohort of horses. Small RNAseq detected 138 parasite-derived and 533 horse-derived miRNAs in the plasma samples. No difference in parasite-derived miRNA abundance was found between the infected and uninfected horses, but 140 horse-derived miRNAs were significantly differentially abundant between the two groups. When evaluated by qPCR, none of the selected parasite-derived miRNAs were detectable in plasma, but seven horse-derived miRNAs were confirmed differentially abundant in plasma between the two groups. Seven horse-derived miRNAs were differentially expressed in CMA tissue affected by migrating S. vulgaris compared with unaffected aortic tissue, with Eca-Mir-223–3p (Log2FC: 4.74) and Eca-Mir-140–3p (Log2FC: −3.64) being most differentially expressed. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that Eca-Mir-486–5p and Eca-Mir-140–3p had the best diagnostic performance for distinguishing between infected and uninfected horses, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 and 0.77, respectively. Notably, Eca-Mir-140–3p was associated with age, and correcting for interaction with age increased the AUC to 0.96. In conclusion, several horse-derived miRNAs were associated with S. vulgaris infection and could differentiate between infected and uninfected horses based on their plasma abundance. However, the levels of these miRNAs were influenced by other factors (i.e age, breed), complicating their use as biomarkers. Parasite-derived miRNA abundance did not differ between S. vulgaris infected horses and those infected with other parasites using small RNAseq and were below detection limits of qPCR. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Current methods to measure intragastric pH in horses have limitations. A wireless capsule has been designed for continuous esophageal pH monitoring in humans. Objectives: To (1) determine the feasibility and describe the methodology of measuring intragastric pH wirelessly in horses; and (2) determine attachment duration of the capsules. Animals: Eleven healthy adult horses. Methods: Capsules were attached to squamous and glandular gastric mucosa under gastroscopic guidance, using suture loops and 1 to 4 hemostasis clips. pH was continuously recorded using a wireless recorder in both fed and fasted states. Gastroscopy was performed daily to assess capsule attachment and any mucosal damage. Data were analyzed using commercially available software. Values are reported as median (interquartile range). Results: Capsules were successfully placed and data obtained in squamous (n = 11) and glandular (n = 7) regions. The overall duration of squamous capsule attachment was 27 hours (15-32); 1 clip (n = 4) was 15 hours (11-20), 2 clips (n = 2) was 20 hours (16-23), 3 clips (n = 4) was 32 hours (30-32), and 4 clips (n = 1) was 33 hours. The overall duration of glandular capsule attachment was 10 hours (8-21); 1 clip (n = 2) was 11 hours (10-13), 2 clips (n = 2) was 19 hours (14-23), 3 clips (n = 2) was 7 hours (7-8), and 4 clips (n = 1) was 158 hours. There was no substantial damage to the gastric mucosa as a consequence of attachment. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This novel technique enables the wireless measurement of intragastric pH in horses at known locations under fed and fasted conditions, providing a viable alternative for continuous monitoring in both research and clinical scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To explore the influence of acepromazine on the cardiovascular effects of dobutamine in isoflurane-anaesthetised horses premedicated with romifidine. Study design: Prospective randomised clinical trial. Animals: A total of 18 horses undergoing elective arthroscopy were enrolled, of which 12 horses requiring dobutamine were included. Methods: Horses were randomised to receive acepromazine 0.02 mg kg-1 (Group A+) intravenously (IV) or none (Group A-), 35 minutes before anaesthesia. Horses received xylazine 0.2 mg kg-1 concurrently to facilitate IV access. Horses were premedicated with romifidine 0.08 mg kg-1, induced with ketamine 2.2 mg kg-1 and diazepam 0.08 mg kg-1 IV, and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Dobutamine infusion was commenced when mean arterial pressure (MAP) was < 60 mmHg. Cardiovascular data were collected prior to dobutamine, and at a target MAP of ≥ 70 mmHg. Dobutamine start time from induction, duration and dose to reach target MAP were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Cardiovascular variables were compared using repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc Fisher's least significant difference test. Results: Cardiac index (CI) and its percentage change from baseline were significantly higher at target MAP in group A+ [62.0 (49.9–74.2) mL minute-1 kg-1; 42.8 (17.0–68.7) %] than in A- [49.5 (39.6–59.5) mL minute-1 kg-1; -4.05 (-21.2–13.0) %] (p = 0.049; p = 0.003). Group A+ required significantly earlier dobutamine [20 (18–25) minutes] than group A- [36 (27–60) minutes] (p = 0.02). Group A+ required significantly higher dobutamine dose [1.5 (1–2.5) μg kg-1 minute-1] to reach target MAP than group A- [0.5 (0.5–1) μg kg-1 minute-1] (p = 0.009). Conclusion and clinical relevance: Dobutamine significantly increased MAP and CI following pre-anaesthetic acepromazine sedation, in isoflurane-anaesthetised horses premedicated with romifidine. Without acepromazine, dobutamine increased MAP but not CI. Interactions between acepromazine, romifidine and dobutamine on the cardiovascular system should be considered. © 2024 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: The role of dopamine in the regulation of insulin secretion in horses is poorly understood and requires further investigation. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is associated with decreased activity of dopaminergic neurons which normally suppress peptide hormone secretion from the pituitary pars intermedia. A high proportion of horses with PPID also have insulin dysregulation (ID), characterised by post-prandial hyperinsulinaemia and/or tissue insulin resistance, which are risk factors for the development of laminitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor that reduces dopamine production, on insulin sensitivity and the post-prandial insulin response to a glucose-containing meal. Six healthy Standardbred horses were enrolled in a placebo-controlled randomised crossover study, in which one dose of AMPT (40 mg/kg BW) or placebo was administered orally, prior to performing an in-feed oral glucose test (OGT) and a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT). Dopamine reduction by AMPT was confirmed by an increase in plasma prolactin concentration and the lack of post-prandial increase in plasma dopamine concentration compared to placebo. Post-prandial insulin responses, both peak and AUCi, were increased after AMPT compared to placebo (P=0.048 and P=0.005, respectively), without affecting blood glucose concentrations. However, one dose of AMPT did not appear to affect tissue sensitivity as assessed by the FSIGTT. This study confirmed that dopamine plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion in horses, as it does in other species, whereby the post-prandial release of dopamine into the circulation may inhibit pancreatic insulin secretion. Further studies are required to evaluate different dosing protocols for AMPT, and to further investigate the links between PPID, ID and laminitis risk in horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Forage is essential for equine health and performance, but intake of elevated pasture nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) may exacerbate metabolic disorders. This study aimed to investigate the influence of laminitis history on metabolic and morphometric responses in grazing horses. Twelve non-pregnant mares (15 ± 3.4 yrs) were selected based on previous diagnosis of laminitis (PRELAM; n=6) or not (NOLAM; n=6). Horses were maintained on 8.5-ha pasture. Weekly pasture samples were clipped at random for nutrient analysis. Monthly blood samples were collected and analyzed for glucose and insulin concentrations. Body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), and cresty neck score (CNS) were evaluated monthly. Each month, a modified oral sugar test (OST) was used to assess basal (T0) and 75-minute (T75) insulin dynamics following 0.30 mL/kg BW Karo Light Corn Syrup. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED with repeated measures (SAS Institute). PRELAM had greater CNS (P < 0.001), BW (P < 0.05), and BCS compared to NOLAM (P < 0.05). Non-fasted glucose was influenced by month (P < 0.001) while non-fasted insulin was affected by group by month (P = 0.004). Fasted insulin concentrations (T0) were affected by month and group (P < 0.001) where PRELAM had greater concentrations. T75 glucose and insulin concentrations were affected by month (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively) and were higher for PRELAM (P = 0.003). These data suggest horses with greater general and regional adiposity, and previous history of laminitis, often exhibit greater insulin concentrations on pasture and to OST. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: There is very little information available about the health status of young stallions from the German Warmblood population that will, once licensed, shape the future of equestrian sport and horse breeding. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of clinical findings at licensing examinations of candidate stallions and the influences of season of birth, age at licensing, year of licensing, and the evaluator on the distribution of recorded findings. Study design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: Clinical records of 1655 candidate stallions presented for licensing in 2018–2020 were reviewed. Data were provided by all German Warmblood horse-breeding associations and their official veterinarians. Storage and processing of the records was performed using the German equine health database. Generalised linear models were used to determine the influences of fixed effects (season of birth, age at licensing, year of licensing, evaluator) on main clinical findings. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results: No remarks were documented on the clinical examination protocol in 777 of the 1655 horses (47.0%). Furthermore, 51.9% of those stallions with remarks had only one finding documented. The main abnormalities recorded were skin lesions, enlargements on the limbs, and testicular findings. The distributions of several clinical findings differed significantly between the evaluators. Main limitations: Homogenous study population and retrospective data. Conclusions: The clinical part of the licensing examination of German Warmblood candidate stallions presented in 2018–2020 rarely revealed abnormalities. The majority of the clinical findings which were recorded are considered to be of minor clinical relevance, implying an overall favourable clinical health status of the presented stallions. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Patellar ligament (PL) injuries are increasingly being reported in horses, but few studies have described the normal PL ultrasonographic appearance in horses. The aims of this prospective observational study were to describe the ultrasonographic appearance of the PLs and infrapatellar fat pad in a population of horses in training and to relate the ultrasonographic findings to objectively measured movement asymmetry. B-mode and color Doppler ultrasonographic examination of the PLs and infrapatellar fat pad in both hind limbs and objective gait analyses were performed on the 116 riding and trotting horses included in the study. The association between ultrasonographic findings, horse age, and movement asymmetry during the trot was then investigated. Distinct or diffuse hypoechoic regions were commonly found in the intermediate PL (24/116; 20.7%), especially in the caudal aspect of the mid-third of the ligament. The infrapatellar fat pad had a hypoechoic striated appearance in all horses except one, in which it was hyperechoic. No association was found between ultrasonographic findings in the PLs and infrapatellar fat pad and lameness. It is important to recognize that there is biological variation in PL appearance, which may or may not be associated with pain in this area, therefore emphasizing the use of local analgesia to determine the location of the lameness. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Fitness assessment of horses remains challenging. Heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to monitor human athlete's training, but its value is unknown in horses. Hypothesis: The linear domain HRV variables are affected by fitness. Animals: Twelve healthy untrained thoroughbreds were randomly split into a training group (6 weeks of incremental racetrack training) and a control group (no training). Methods: Linear domain HRV variables were analyzed (high frequency [HF], low frequency [LF], their normalized units [Hfnu, Lfnu], root mean square of successive differences between beats [RMSSD], Poincaré plot features [SD1 and SD2]) while resting overnight before (baseline) and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of training. V̇O2max and echocardiographic indexes were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks. Changes in HRV variables over time (ANOVA), and correlation with V̇O2max (Pearson's chi-squared test) were tested (P <.05 significance). Results: V̇O2max, LF/HF ratio, and LFnu increased while HFnu decreased in the training group (before and after training mean [SD] values: V̇O2max 134 [12.8]-146 [16.5] mL/[kg min]; P <.001; LF/HF ratio 0.51 [0.2]-0.91 [0.3] [P =.02]; LFnu 37.5 [10.1]-46.8 [7.8] [P =.02]; HFnu 76.2 [7.9]-53.2 [7.7] [P <.001]). Training did not affect RMSSD, SD1, SD2, resting HR, or echocardiographic indexes. Strong correlations were found between V̇O2max and HRV variables (V̇O2max and LFnu [r = −0.59, P =.04]; ΔV̇O2max and the corresponding ΔLF [r = −0.88, P =.02]). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Six weeks of training affected some frequency domain HRV variables. Further studies are necessary to validate the use of HRV for monitoring horses' responses to training. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Anecdotally, horses' gaits sound rhythmic. Are they really? In this study, we quantified the motor rhythmicity of horses across three different gaits (walk, trot, and canter). For the first time, we adopted quantitative tools from bioacoustics and music cognition to quantify locomotor rhythmicity. Specifically, we tested whether kinematics data contained rhythmic categories; these occur when adjacent temporal intervals are categorically, rather than randomly, distributed. We extracted the motion cycle duration (tk) of two ipsilateral hooves from motion data of 13 ridden horses and calculated the ratios from two successive tk values. We tested whether these ratios significantly fell within rhythmic categories and quantified how close they were to small-integer ratios, a rhythmic feature also present in animal vocalizations and human music. We found a strong isochronous pattern—a 1:1 rhythmic ratio, corresponding to the ticking of a clock—in the motion of single limbs for all gaits. We also analyzed the interlimb coordination of the two ipsilateral hooves' impacts to identify differences associated with the biomechanical patterns of the three gaits. We found an interlimb 1:1 rhythmic pattern for trot and 1:3 and 3:1 rhythmic categories for walk and canter. Our findings are a first step toward quantifying rhythmicity in horse locomotion and potentially the resulting rhythmic sounds, with possible implications as tools to detect gait irregularities. Overall, we show that rhythmic categories are a valuable tool for gait kinematic analysis and that they can be used to quantify temporal patterns in the motor domain. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Fungal rhinitis in horses is rare, although severe, due to the progressive nasal obstruction. Aspergillus is one of the fungi most often involved in these cases. A 7-year-old Quarter Horse mare weighing 325 kg was admitted with a history of recurrent nasal discharge and bleeding, foul smell, reluctance to exercise, and abortion. Laboratory and imaging examinations revealed eosinophilia, scarring and erosion areas in the nasal mucosa, purulent and bloody secretions, and remarkable yellowish plaques. Histopathological examination revealed fungal rhinitis and bacterial culture revealed the presence of β-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus sp. Fungal culture and molecular diagnosis confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus as the etiological agent. A tracheostomy was necessary due to the patient’s dyspnea. For the treatment, topical application of clotrimazole ointment was carried out in the rostral portion of the nasal cavity once a day and in the caudal portion of the nasal cavity, endoscopic guided every 48 h. In the fifth endoscopy-guided application, a significant improvement was noticed; however, the animal exhibited a hypersensitivity reaction, and the treatment was discontinued. Thus, potassium iodide therapy was initiated (67 mg/kg, PO, SID, 14 days). The patient demonstrated favorable clinical improvement, achieved resolution of the fungal infection, and was discharged after 25 days of hospitalization. Topical clotrimazole demonstrated a probable efficacy as a standalone treatment, although its use had to be prematurely discontinued due to the emergence of a hypersensitivity reaction. The combination of clotrimazole and potassium iodide effectively treated fungal rhinitis in a shorter time than previously reported. This report provides useful guidance for other cases of fungal rhinitis, although further studies are needed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Organisations for which sentient animals are central to the business model need to demonstrate the safeguarding of animal welfare and well-being. This requires providing positive experiences for animals which is critical to maintaining the social licence to operate. A cross-sectional survey captured the attitudes of experienced horse sector participants regarding sentience, welfare and well-being. Almost all respondents (99.9%; n = 676/677), believed horses were sentient. Analysis of open-ended responses identified two themes: (1) Sentience is a pathway to understanding the mental state, welfare and well-being of horses; and (2) A moral obligation for humans to consider sentience. Respondents’ observations that horses reacted to stimuli and responded to their surroundings underpinned their belief that horses were sentient. Theme one related to respondents’ understanding of sentience and how sentience informed their interpretations of horse behaviours and the making of inferences regarding the equine mental state. Theme two related to a moral obligation believed to exist towards horses because humans manage the horses’ environment and need to consider the impact of their interactions with horses. These obligations were perceived as responsibilities to consider sentience when determining good welfare and well-being in horse activity settings, when interacting with horses and when training and competing with horses. The results suggested a sophisticated understanding of sentience existed among experienced horse sector participants, who recognised the sentient horse as worthy of care. We propose that leveraging experienced participants’ existing knowledge of sentience could support the implementation of the Five Domains model when updating organisational policies. © 2025 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

ABSTRACT: The brilliant black reduction test (BRT) is a first and rapid screening test routinely used across the German dairy industry for the detection of antimicrobial substances, especially antibiotics, in cow's milk samples. This study aimed to determine if the three test systems BRT Inhibitor Test, BRT MRL-Screening Test and BRT hi-sense can also be applied to buffalo and horse milk. For buffalo milk, the detection limits of all antibiotics under investigation were at or below the European maximum residue levels (MRL). Previous freezing of the antibiotics in buffalo milk showed comparable results. While the BRT hi-sense is not recommended for horse milk, detection limits at or below the MRL were reached with the BRT Inhibitor Test and/or the BRT MRL-Screening Test for penicillins, neomycin, gentamicin, as well as streptomycin (BRT MRL-Screening Test only). In general, it must be noted that the incubation times of the test systems need extending compared to cow's milk and that horse milk must be heated before application. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: QUINE respiratory diseases represent a major health challenge for both young foals and adult horses. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate and compare the respiratory affections in foal and adult horses with upper and lower respiratory diseases. A total number of 150 horses (30 control and 120 diseased) were subjected to clinical, hematological and biochemical examinations. The affected foals and horses were categorized according to clinical and ultrasonographic examination into upper respiratory tract affections (URT) and upper complicated with lower (UCL) respiratory affections. Blood and serum samples were collected from diseased and control foals and adult horses. The results showed significant decrease (P<0.05) in RBCs, HCT, PLT, albumin, A/G, SOD and CAT activity with significant increase (P<0.05) in WBCs, neutrophil, SAA, Hp, CRP, IL-6, TP, globulin, MDA in URT subgroups. While the UCL subgroups showed significant decrease in RBCs, Hb, HCT, PLT, albumin, A/G, SOD and CAT activity with significant increase (P< 0.05) in WBCs, neutrophil, lymphocytes, SAA, Hp, CRP, IL-6, TP, globulin and MDA. Moreover, there was significant change in WBCs, neutrophil, lymphocytes, HCT, PLT, SAA, Hp, CRP, IL-6, TP, Albumin, Globulin, A/G, SOD, MDA, and CAT between foals and adult horses. Thus, we concluded that timely intervention is crucial to prevent the progression of upper respiratory affections to lower respiratory complications, which can have more severe consequences on the horse's health. Moreover, early management of respiratory tract diseases in horses is recommended through regular monitoring and veterinary care. ©2025 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

ABSTRACT: Behavioural and physiological responses are suggested indicators of horse stress. The responses can vary according to changing intrinsic factors, for example, age or habituation to human handling and restraint. In this study, the same 53 Konik Polski horses that were born in either a forest-born (FB) sanctuary or a stable-born (SB) sanctuary were assessed for consistency in their behavioural and physiological responses over months, and the relationship between avoidance behaviour (withdrawals, head shakings, jerks, rearings, stepping and their total: AB), leaning behaviour and cardiac responses (heart rate: HR and heart rate variability HRV: SDRR and RMSSD during routine hoof trimming at 6, 12 and 18 months of age was examined. Additionally, the effect of age and birthplace on avoidance behaviour and cardiac parameters and their correlations was investigated. The avoidance behaviour, leaning behaviour and HR and HRV parameters differed between SB and FB horses (P < 0.01). A significant effect of increasing age/habituation was found in each birth-place group at each age (both effects P < 0.01). Additionally, the correlations of and between behaviour and cardiac parameters were fairly consistent both over age and within groups. The findings indicate that physiological and behavioural markers that are frequently used may not adequately represent the stress status of restrained horses; rather, they may only represent the animals' short-term, current state. Age and prior experience are significant factors to consider when evaluating stress related to husbandry management procedures. Providing that the differences between forest and stable horses remain until 18 months old, the rearing conditions up to weaning would seem sufficient to develop a specific human reception in young horses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Myocardial sleeves of the caudal vena cava are the predilection site for atrial tachycardia (AT) in horses. Caudal vena cava isolation guided by the ablation index, a lesion quality marker incorporating power, duration and contact force, might improve outcome. Objectives: Describe the feasibility and outcome of caudal vena cava isolation using ablation index-guided radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) to treat AT in horses. Animals: Ten horses with sustained AT. Methods: Records from 10 horses with sustained AT treated by three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping and ablation index-guided RFCA (CARTO™ 3) were reviewed. Results: Three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping of the right atrium identified a macro-reentry circuit in the caudomedial right atrium (n = 10). Point-by-point RFCA was performed to isolate the myocardial sleeves of the caudal vena cava in power-controlled mode with a mean of 17 ± 7 applications. The ablation index target was 400-450. A median ablation index of 436 (range, 311-763) was reached using a median maximum power of 35 (range, 24-45) W for a median duration of 20 (range, 8-45) seconds, with a median contact force of 10 (range, 3-48) g. Sinus rhythm was restored in all 10 horses. To date, 9-37 months post-ablation, none of the horses have had recurrence. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Caudal vena cava isolation using ablation index-guided RFCA was feasible and effective to permanently treat sustained AT in horses. Ablation index guidance ensured efficient lesion creation, and isolation of the caudal vena cava eliminated the arrhythmogenic substrate, thereby minimizing the risk of recurrence. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Jejunocaecostomy (JC) is frequently required to bypass diseased ileum as a side-to-side (SS) anastomosis with blind end closure of the small intestine. The effects of the blind end closure method on the performance of the anastomosis have not been studied. Objectives: To compare handsewn and stapled blind end closures of the ileum and jejunum. Study design: In vivo experiments. Methods: JC was performed with either Parker–Kerr (PK; 6 horses) or oversewn stapled technique (OS; 6 horses) to close jejunum and ileum for an SS anastomosis. At surgery, peritoneal fluid was analysed and various anastomotic measurements and time to complete the anastomosis were recorded. Physical and haematological findings and serum amyloid A (SAA) were recorded postoperatively. At necropsy on day 7, anastomotic measurements and peritoneal fluid analysis were repeated. Tissues collected at surgery and necropsy underwent histological and immunohistological evaluations. Results: Two PK horses developed intussusception of the jejunal blind end into the caecum and another PK horse was euthanised because of anastomotic impaction. One OS horse had mild postoperative colic. Postoperative peripheral neutrophil counts and SAA were similar between groups but SAA significantly (0.5 mg/L [0.3, 0.7], p < 0.001) increased with time in both. The OS jejunal blind ends (4.7 cm [4.41, 6.85]) were significantly larger (PK = 3.5 cm [3.3, 4.08], p = 0.004) and the OS blind ends (18.6 min ± 1.32) were significantly slower to complete (11.3 min ± 0.37, p = 0.002). Inflammation developed between the everting staple line and inverting suture line in the OS closure and along transected edges in the PK. Peritoneal fluid total protein increased significantly between surgery (19 g/L [19, 19]) and necropsy (34 g/L [30, 41], p < 0.001) without differences between groups. Main limitations: Small sample size and short follow-up. Conclusion: Both blind-end techniques could be acceptable, although more complications developed with the PK method. The anastomotic intussusceptions were unexpected and possibly unique to the anastomotic design. © 2025 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The application of sex-sorted semen in horses has historically lagged the bovine industry due to differences in the reproductive physiology and grater variability in equine semen quality. Recent advancements, including SuperGen™ sorters and Ultraplus™ semen processing methods developed by STgenetics® (Navasota, Texas), have significantly improved the efficiency of the sex-sorting process and reduced the sperm damage previously reported. To facilitate the broader use sex-sorted semen in the equine industry, it is essential to address challenges such as shipping cooled semen to a central sorting facility, minimizing oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation, and developing effective methods for short-term cooling or long-term cryopreservation of the sex-sorted sperm. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of shipping cooled (8 °C) equine semen to a central facility for sorting and assessed the quality of sperm post-sorting and preservation. Results from the improved process showed enhancements in sperm motility, morphology, viability and DNA fragmentation following sex-sorting. Although there was a slight, consistent increase in lipid peroxidation of sex-sorted sperm, the quality of sperm over the first 24 h post-sorting was comparable to that of conventional (non-sorted) cool-shipped semen. Fertility rates with fresh semen did not differ between conventional and sex-sorted sperm. When using frozen-thawed sex-sorted sperm for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), consistent blastocyst production was achieved, albeit at slightly lower rates than those observed with conventional semen for the same stallions. Stallion-specific variability may account for some of these differences. Overall, sex-sorted semen used for ICSI resulted in a higher number of embryos of the desired sex compared to those obtained using conventional semen. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Here we report the isolation of Streptococcus hillyeri from a thoracic sample from a horse. A 17-y-old Hungarian Sport Horse mare was referred to the equine clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine Budapest, Hungary, with suspected pleuritis. Upon arrival, the horse was febrile and had tachycardia, severe inspiratory dyspnea, and tachypnea. Thoracic ultrasonography revealed severe bilateral pleural effusion, and a large area of lung consolidation. After sampling of both hemithoraces, 66 L of turbid exudate were drained. Based on these findings, a tentative diagnosis of septic pleuritis was made, and the horse was immediately started on a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, a NSAID, an anticoagulant, and intravenous fluids. Despite intensive care, the clinical parameters deteriorated, and the horse was euthanized 6 d later. Cytology confirmed septic pleuritis, with short chains or groups of coccoid bacteria. Anaerobic culture yielded gram-positive cocci from both hemithoraces in almost pure culture, which we identified as S. hillyeri by 16S rDNA and whole-genome analysis. Additionally, we identified 4 previously unassigned Streptococcus sp. sequences as S. hillyeri. Of these, 3 were obtained from aborted equine fetuses and a fourth from a donkey mastitis case, supporting the pathogenic nature of S. hillyeri in these host species. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Recent research on populism has shown how anti-populist politics have served to discredit alternatives to the status quo by constructing them as threats to democracy, creating false equivalences between vastly different political projects. Yet, while the people of populism are often represented as a threat, it would be a mistake to conclude that anti-populist discourse is equivalent to faith in the elite. We explore how elites and peoples are constructed in anti-populist discourses. Left-wing voters are constructed as active agents in their political choices, even though these choices are often blamed on their youth and/or minority status and radical naivety. Supporters of the far right are instead presented as having legitimate concerns around migration and nationhood, but manipulated by a crass ‘populist’ elite. In contrast, a ‘good’ people is constructed to justify the presence and leadership of the ‘good’ elite who rules for them (if not by and of them). © The Author(s) 2025.

ABSTRACT: Analyzing genetic variability and inbreeding trends is essential for effective breed management in animal populations. To this, the characterization of runs of homozygosity (ROH) provides a good genomic approach to study the phenomena. The Polo Argentino (PA) breed, globally recognized as the best adapted to playing polo, is known for its strong influence of Thoroughbreds, intense selective breeding, and extensive use of reproductive biotechnologies. This study investigates the PA’s genomic variability, by characterizing the ROH landscape and identifying ROH islands (ROHi) as potential genomic footprints for the breed. PA horses (n = 506) were genotyped using EquineGGP™ array v5 (70 k). We calculated the inbreeding coefficient based on ROH (FROH—ancestral and recent) using a chromosomal approach. Finally, we identified genomic regions with increased ROH frequency (ROHi) and their associated genes. An average of 79.5 ROH per horse was detected, with a mean length of 4.6 Mb. The average FROH was 0.151, but most of them (54%) corresponded to ancestral inbreeding (ROH < 5.5 Mb). However, 4 ROHi were identified in ECA 1, 3, 7 and 17, containing 67 genes, some of which were related to behavior, neurodevelopment, and metabolic functions. This genomic analysis determined, for the first time, the length and location of homozygosity segments in the PA breed and identified ROHi associated with potential genomic regions and genes for positive selection in the breed. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Amidst the therapeutic quandaries associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive malignancy distinguished by its immune resistance and limited treatment avenues, the urgent need for innovative solutions is underscored. To conquer the dilemma, we present a groundbreaking approach that ingeniously employs DNA-fragments-containing exosomes (DNA-Exo) and the concept of “biological logic-gates” to achieve precise homing and controlled selective activation of ferroptosis and stimulator interferon genes (STING) pathways. Leveraging insights from our previous research, a nano-Trojan-horse, Fe0@HMON@DNA-Exo, is engineered via in situ Fe0 synthesis within the glutathione (GSH)-responsiveness degradable hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (HMON) and subsequently enveloped in DNA-Exo derived from 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)-treated 4T1 cells. Emphasizing the precision of our approach, the DNA-Exo ensures specific ‘homing’ to TNBC cells, rendering a targeted delivery mechanism. Concurrently, the concept of “biological logic-gates” is employed to dictate a meticulous and selective activation of STING in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) under OR logic-gating with robust immune response and Fe0-based ferroptosis in TNBC cells under AND logic-gating with reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation. In essence, our strategy exhibits great potential in transforming the “immunologically cold” nature of TNBC, enabling precise control over cellular responses, illuminating a promising therapeutic paradigm that is comprehensive and productive in pursuing precision oncology and paving the way for personalized TNBC therapies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Horses have become more intensively managed, including the use of hay nets to increase intake time and reduce hay waste, but their impact on health is not well known. The objectives were to compare changes in subluxations, range of motion, and the pain-pressure threshold in the axial skeleton of horses fed hay with (NET) or without (CON) hay nets. In September 2021, 13 adult horses were blocked by bodyweight (BW) and randomly assigned to the NET or CON treatments for one year. After one year, horses switched treatments and the trial concluded in September 2023. Horses were housed in dry lots with free choice access to round bales with or without hay nets (4.45 cm openings). Chiropractic adjustments occurred in May and August each year to note axial skeleton subluxations. Evaluations occurred in June, July, and August to measure cervical range of motion and mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNTs) of the jaw, poll, and withers. SAS was used and significance was set at P≤0.05. There was an average 1.6-point increase in cervical subluxations observed in NET horses (P<0.05) while no changes were observed for the TMJ and thoracic or lumbar vertebral regions (P>0.05). Average cervical range of motion was 5 degrees greater in NET horses compared to CON horses for chin to chest and chin to fetlock measurements (P≤0.05). No differences were observed in MNTs (P>0.05). These data suggest that netted round bales may only have minor impacts on the axial skeleton of horses over 12-weeks. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Whereas restoration of fecal consistency after treatment with clioquinol for chronic diarrhea and free fecal water syndrome has been attributed to its antiprotozoal properties, actions of clioquinol on the colonic bacterial microbiota have not been investigated. Objectives: Characterize the dynamics of fecal microbial diversity before, during, and after PO administration of clioquinol to healthy horses. Study Design: Experimental prospective cohort study using a single horse group. Methods: Eight healthy adult horses received PO clioquinol (10 g, daily) for 7 days. Feces were obtained daily for 7 days before, during, and after conclusion of treatment, and again 3 months later. Libraries of 16S rRNA V4 region amplicons generated from fecal DNA were sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform. Bioinformatic analysis was undertaken with QIIME2 and statistical analyses included analysis of variance (ANOVA) and permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA). Results: The richness and composition of the fecal microbiome was altered after administration of clioquinol, reaching a maximum effect by the fifth day of administration. Changes included a 90% decrease in richness, and compensatory expansion of facultative anaerobes including Streptococcaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Multiple horses had Salmonella cultured from feces. Main Limitations: Limitations including lack of control group and modest sample size are obviated by robust longitudinal study design and strong effect size associated with drug exposure. Conclusions: Clioquinol has broad-spectrum antibacterial effects on the fecal microbiome of horses, but spares certain bacterial families including several pathogens and pathobionts. Clioquinol should be used with caution in horses, in an environment free of contamination with fecal pathogens. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The detection of hindlimb lameness is usually considered to be more difficult than the forelimb lameness; thus, it tends to be overlooked. Therefore, an alternative diagnostic method employing acupuncture points for diagnosis of hindlimb lameness is being considered. The objective of this study was to identify the diagnostic acupoints associated with hock pain in sport horses with hindlimb lameness. In this study, 33 sport horses from polo and riding activities were examined for hock pain through acupuncture diagnosis (AD), subjective lameness examinations (SE) by experienced equine veterinarians’ opinions, and objective lameness examinations (OE) using body-mounted inertial sensor systems. From 33 horses, 14 horses with hock pain were included in this study and underwent intra-articular analgesia at the tarsometatarsal joint (TMT block). Each horse was then assessed and graded with the score of improvement for sensitivity of acupuncture points and lameness. From 14 horses, the results indicated that the kappa test for agreement of diagnostic method in determining lame limbs between AD and OE was 71.43% (95%CI = 51.33%-86.77%), which was significantly higher when compared with the agreement between AD and SE at 64.29% (95%CI = 44.07%-81.36%). Among the improved horses after TMT block, the score of improvement for sensitivity of acupuncture points also improved significantly on four transpositional acupoints. Based on our findings, Gallbladder-27, Spleen-13, Bladder-39a, and Bladder-39b were determined to be valuable suggestive acupoints for hock pain in horses with different sport activities. In conclusion, the results of this study advocate for the use of acupuncture diagnosis as a supporting lameness diagnosis method. © 2025 Author (s).

ABSTRACT: The melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) has relevance to equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), as it is the primary binding site for ACTH, which circulates at elevated concentrations in animals affected by PPID. Despite this, little is known about MC2R in equine species. The overall aim of this investigation was to determine MC2R mRNA expression in tissues relevant to PPID in healthy horses and to examine the MC2R gene sequence in a cohort of horses and ponies with and without PPID. The study found that the MC2R gene was expressed in both adrenal and pituitary gland tissues as reported in other mammalian species. However, no expression was seen in adipose or skin tissue. An investigation of the tissue distribution and functionality of the MC2R in individuals with PPID is now recommended. Then, we investigated the coding regions (exons) of the equine MC2R gene for variations associated with PPID in a limited number of animals. This was performed using a hybridised gene capture and next generation sequencing method which found a 100% pairwise identity between all 28 individuals in the study, and with the reference genome sequence. This preliminary study found no evidence of major genetic variations in the coding region of the MC2R gene associated with PPID, though variants affecting expression may occur in the introns or remain unidentified within the exons of the gene and studies on a larger scale are required. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Fungal and bacterial culture is currently the primary method for pathogen detection and identification. Next-generation sequencing is a powerful method for detecting and identifying the presence of microbial DNA in samples. We evaluated the correlation between fungal and bacterial culture with next-generation sequencing in equine uterine samples. Fungal cultures (n=63) were evaluated based on their culture results. In culture positive (n=16) samples, next-generation sequencing identified the same organism in 10 samples (62.5%), 5 samples did not identify fungal agents, and 1 sample identified other species of fungal agents. In no growth samples (n=42), next-generation sequencing did not identify fungal agents in 37 samples (88.1%), 4 samples had a potential fungal pathogen identified, and one sample identified only non-pathogenic fungal organisms. Fungal culture and next-generation sequencing had an 80% agreement and moderate correlation by Kappa coefficient (0.508). Bacterial culture (n=57) was also evaluated based on bacterial culture results. In bacterial culture Positive samples (n=32), next-generation sequencing identified the same organism in 25 (78.1%) samples, and identified different organisms from the remaining 7 samples. In bacterial no growth samples (n=14), next-generation sequencing detected bacterial presence in 5 samples, and 9 samples had no bacterial DNA identified. The agreement between bacterial culture and next-generation sequencing was 74% with a moderate correlation by Kappa coefficient (0.46). In conclusion, culture and next-generation sequencing have moderate correlation, and next-generation sequencing has the potential as a diagnostic option for enhancing pathogen detection for equine endometritis. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Alcohol-based antisepsis has shown experimentally to be as effective as 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) at reducing bacterial counts (colony forming units; CFU) on equine skin. Our objectives were to determine the immediate and post-surgical reduction in CFU/mL on equine skin prepared with CHG-based or 70 % isopropyl alcohol (IPA)-based (without CHG) protocols in a clinical setting with arthroscopic surgery. Our hypotheses were that the log10CFU/mL reduction would not significantly differ between protocols immediately after preparation or at the end of surgery. Six horses underwent a 40 min bilateral tarsocrural joint arthroscopy with each limb randomly assigned to Group A or B. Group A tarsocrural joints underwent a rough scrub using 4 % CHG and a 5 min sterile scrub using 2 % CHG. Group B underwent a rough scrub with neutral soap followed by a 90 s sterile scrub with IPA. Samples were collected before rough scrub (T0), immediately after sterile scrub (T1), and end of surgery (T2). CFU/mL were determined in duplicate and were log-transformed and averaged. ANOVA models compared the immediate reduction (T0-T1) and sustained reduction (T0-T2) between treatment groups. The immediate and sustained log10CFU/mL reduction between groups was not different (P = 0.46, P = 0.42). Both groups achieved at least a 2-log immediate and sustained reduction. Limitations include small population size, short surgical duration, length of follow-up, and researchers were not blinded to treatment during sampling. This study demonstrates efficacy of IPA-based antisepsis, without the need for CHG, and supports further investigation in clinical surgery as an acceptable method of surgical site preparation. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Sperm vitrification is an alternative freezing method, which includes high cooling rates and non-permeable cryoprotectants agents. The first attempt in equids was using the spheres technique by directly dropping small volumes of the sperm into liquid nitrogen. Later, vitrification was developed using 0.25 mL straws with outer covers, which resulted in similar progressive motility when compared to conventional freezing in donkeys (44.3 ± 15.0 % vs. 44.7 ± 18.2 %) or even higher in horses (48.2 ± 2.3 % vs. 37.3 ± 2.2 %). Subsequently, the vitrification of larger volumes of sperm in 0.5 mL straws was evaluated, but the results showed poor sperm quality after different warming procedures. Finally, fertility was assessed in vitro and in vivo. In horses, the sperm fertilizing capacity was assessed utilizing heterologous in vitro fertilization (IVF) and vitrified sperm showed the ability to penetrate cattle oocytes, leading to pronuclear formation and hybrid embryo cleavage. In donkeys, fertility trials were conducted in vivo on a small group of jennies, showing no statistically significant difference in pregnancy rates between artificial insemination (AI) with vitrified semen (22%) or frozen semen (10%); however, the uterine inflammatory response after AI with vitrified semen solved faster than frozen semen. In conclusion, sperm vitrification has been optimized in horses and donkeys using 0.25 mL straws with outer covers and can be considered as an alternative to conventional freezing. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Helminthiasis in horse breeding stands out due to the damage caused by this infection, which is mainly controlled by anthelmintic drugs. Knowing the population dynamics of helminths in a given region is therefore essential, as environmental conditions have a major impact on the development of these parasites in pastures. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of seasonality on helminths. It was carried out between October and September of the years 2015/2016, 2018/2019 and 2021/2022. A total of 147 animals were used, 64 females and 83 males, all from the same herd. Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectal ampulla of each animal every 28 days for 12 months of each cycle for coproparasitological analysis. Average air temperature, average relative humidity and rainfall were measured daily. The weather records were collected by the Agroclimatological Station in Castilho, SP (21o 05' 12.4" S; 51o 35' 17.2" W), located six kilometers from the experiment site. In the three study cycles, the EPG and rainfall averages showed significant differences between the times of year. In general, the month with the highest EPG in the different cycles was February, with 1626 in 2015/2016, 926.7 in 2018/2019 and 1885 in 2021/2022, and the month with the lowest average EPG was July, with 642 in 2015/2016, 610.5 in 2018/2019 and 804 in 2021/2022. Regarding climatic conditions, rainfall was more concentrated in two seasons, spring and summer, meaning that summer was the season with the highest rainfall in the three cycles evaluated. Autumn, followed by winter were the seasons with the lowest rainfall during the cycles studied. It can be concluded that climatic conditions have a direct influence on the population dynamics of helminths, and that during the drier and colder seasons, horses were less affected, so the suggestion for a possible strategic program would be to concentrate the administration of anthelmintics in spring and summer. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A 3-year-old racing Arabian mare was admitted to the hospital with a 5-day history of muscle pain, lethargy and anorexia. The mare arrived at the hospital with marked neurological abnormalities, dehydration and melaena. Investigation revealed severe azotaemia, acute renal failure, hyperammonaemia and evidence of recent myopathy. Therapeutic objectives were the correction of fluid deficiencies and restoration of normal renal function and urine production. The mare responded rapidly to treatment and was discharged after 12 days, before going on to race the following year. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of survival of a case of acute renal failure with metabolic encephalopathy associated with hyperammonaemia and uraemic syndrome in the horse. Additionally, the case had symptoms of GI disease consistent with uraemic damage to the intestine. © 2025 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study utilized metabolomics and metagenomics to investigate the microbial composition and functions in low- and high-salt Chinese horse bean-chili pastes (CHCPs). The results showed that 25 key metabolites were identified to distinguish the flavor attributes between the two samples. Leuconostoc was identified as the dominant microbiota in low-salt CHCP, while Pantoea prevailed in the high-salt CHCP. Compared to traditional high-salt fermentation, low-salt and inoculated fermentation promoted the increase in the relative abundances of Companionlactobacillus, Levilactobacillus, Tetragenococcus, Zygosaccharomyces and Wickerhamiella as well as the enrichment of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways, which contributed to the enhancement of characteristic flavor compounds. Further metabolic pathway reconstruction elucidated 21 potential microbial genera associated with the formation of key metabolites, such as Leuconostoc, Levilactobacillus, Pantoea, and Pectobacterium. This study may provide insights for optimizing the fermentation process and improving the flavor quality of low-salt CHCP and similar fermentation products.

ABSTRACT: Background: Regular exercise benefits horses' overall health; yet data on long-term physiological adaptations in polo horses remains limited. Objectives: The study aimed to compare the clinical, haematology and serum biochemical profiles of polo and sedentary horses. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Forty adult mares (20 sedentary and 20 polo), aged 10–15 years, were evaluated. The polo horses had competed in three major high-goal and nine medium/low-goal tournaments in the previous 12 months and received daily exercise, while the sedentary horses were for leisure and kept in their stalls most of the time with no physical activity. The study evaluated the following clinical parameters at rest: respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein via 10 mL syringes and analysed for haematological and biochemical parameters. Independent t test was used for statistical analysis, with a p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Results: Polo horses showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) resting respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure compared to sedentary horses. Haematologically, polo horses exhibited higher (p < 0.05) packed cell volume (37.2 ± 5.9% vs. 33.1 ± 3.0%), haemoglobin (12.1 ± 2.1 vs. 10.8 ± 1.0 g/dL), red blood cells (5.9 ± 1.1 vs. 5.2 ± 0.8 × 106/μL) and platelets (127.4 ± 17.7 vs. 108.1 ± 20.5 × 109/μL). Biochemically, polo horses demonstrated higher (p < 0.05) total protein, albumin, globulin, creatinine, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and high-density lipoprotein, while showing lower (p < 0.05) aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in rectal temperature, diastolic blood pressure, most white blood cell parameters, glucose, electrolytes and several other biochemical markers. Conclusion: Regular polo training induces favourable physiological adaptations. Future research should track these changes longitudinally and inform improved training and care strategies for equine athletes. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Sinusitis is common in horses. Sinoscopy is used for visualization of sinus cavities and can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this surgical procedure, a larger chamber is created and communication with other sinus compartments facilitated. To compare the applicability of different surgical approaches and rigid endoscopy systems for sinus inspection and fenestration of the maxillary septal bulla, and to examine the impact of different lens angles on the effectiveness of the procedure. Six chemically preserved cadaveric equine heads were used. Frontal and caudal maxillary portals were tested. Portals were created in the right and left antimeres of each specimen, over the frontal and the caudal maxillary sinus. Two types of rigid 4 mm endoscopes (0º and 30º) were used. The comprehensiveness of sinus examination and the applicability of portals for fenestration of the maxillary septal bulla were evaluated. Satisfactory exploration of sinus cavities and structures of interest was achieved in all specimens. Fenestration of the maxillary septal bulla was successfully accomplished using frontal portals as viewing portals and caudal maxillary portals as instrument portals. When caudal maxillary portals were used as viewing portals, endoscope maneuverability was limited by the infraorbital canal in 50% of antimeres. When frontal portals were used as instrument portals, the frontomaxillary opening interfered with or prevented appropriate fenestration of the bulla in 83.33 % and 16.66 % of antimeres respectively. Ideally, frontal portals should be used as viewing portals and caudal maxillary portals as instrument portals for successful fenestration of the maxillary septal bulla. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Radiotherapy as a mainstay of in-depth cervical cancer (CC) treatment suffers from its radioresistance. Radiodynamic therapy (RDT) effectively reverses radio-resistance by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) with deep tissue penetration. However, the photosensitizers stimulated by X-ray have high toxicity and energy attenuation. Therefore, X-ray responsive diselenide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) are designed, loading X-ray-activated photosensitizer acridine orange (AO) for spot blasting RDT like Trojan-horse against radio-resistance cervical cancer (R–CC). DMSNs can encapsulate a large amount of AO, in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which has a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide, X-ray radiation triggers the cleavage of diselenide bonds, leading to the degradation of DMSNs and the consequent release of AO directly at the tumor site. On the one hand, it solves the problems of rapid drug clearance, adverse distribution, and side effects caused by simple AO treatment. On the other hand, it fully utilizes the advantages of highly penetrating X-ray responsive RDT to enhance radiotherapy sensitivity. This approach results in ROS-induced mitochondria damage, inhibition of DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest and promotion of cancer cell apoptosis in R–CC. The X-ray responsive DMSNs@AO hold considerable potential in overcoming obstacles for advanced RDT in the treatment of R–CC. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Combining an in-depth exploration of equine behaviour with clinical practice from a new progressive perspective, Equine Behaviour in Practice: Understanding Horses and Treating Behaviour Problems focuses not just on the horse's behaviour but also on the behaviour of the human interacting with the horse. Acclaimed Clinical Equine Behaviourist Debbie Busby delivers evidence-based knowledge that will equip readers with the understanding and skills to become effective equine behaviour consultants. Supported by considered discussion of how and why horses sometimes struggle to cope, the book comprehensively explains how to consult on and treat a range of equine behaviour problems. Rather than providing a formulaic "here's the problem; here's how to fix it", Busby encourages readers to develop a critical biopsychosocial evaluation based on an understanding of how horses evolved, their ethological and physiological adaptations, how they learn, and how their welfare and wellbeing can be assessed. Key Features: Part 1 explains theories of equine evolution and the thin veneer of domestication Part 2 describes psychological and physiological theories of how horses learn, and how this can be applied in training and behaviour modification Part 3 illustrates this with reference to relevant legislation and widely used animal welfare models, as well as assessments of abnormal and stereotypic behaviour and practical aspects of measuring welfare Part 4 turns to the theory and practice of behaviour consulting, in three chapters divided into elements of behavioural assessment and treatment planning Part 5 examines the use of psychopharmaceuticals in behaviour therapy, discussing the roles of the behaviour consultant and the referring veterinary surgeon Bridging the gap between science and practice, this book is a must-read for equine behaviour and veterinary students, equine behaviour consultants and practitioners, horse trainers, interested leisure riders and competition riders. It will empower equine professionals to combine behavioural and welfare knowledge with counselling and coaching skills to support horse owners in a mutual flourishing, enriching the lives of both species. © 2025 Debbie Busby.

ABSTRACT: With the advancement of observation technology, visual data has made significant progress, rendering manual image classification less effective. Consequently, various image processing and automatic classification methods have garnered attention from researchers. Scientists estimate that there are approximately 2 trillion observable galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy possesses unique characteristics that are distinguishable. Therefore, finding a method to quickly and accurately identify these characteristics of each galaxy and classify them rapidly can greatly enhance the galaxy detection and classification process, while minimizing human errors. The objective of the present study is to determine the class of galaxies with from telescope image features using an optimized classifier with best parameters. The proposed method uses the HOA algorithm, based on the behavior of horse herds, to find the best parameters. This method evaluates the model's error with different SVM parameters and selects the optimal SVM parameters for constructing M-SVM. Using this method, the proposed algorithm is trained and ultimately applied to classify the test data. The results indicate that the developed model correctly classified up to 94.11% of the test dataset (1) and 90.74% of the test dataset (2). © 2024

ABSTRACT: Ethylene glycol toxicosis is a common occurrence in dogs and cats but has been reported in other species as well. Up to date, only one case of ethylene glycol toxicosis has been described in horses, and specific guidelines for treating ethylene glycol intoxication in this species are not available. Here we describe the case of 39 sport horses that ingested water contaminated with ethylene glycol. The main clinical sign was apathy, but more severely affected individuals also developed abdominal pain and laminitis. Treatment was initiated around 24 h after the exposure, using ethanol as an antidote, which was administered initially through a nasogastric tube and subsequently via perfusion. Five horses required hospitalization, but all 39 horses recovered. Based on biochemical measurements performed at different timepoints, we proposed several markers that can be used to determine the need for specialized care early on during the treatment. © 2025

ABSTRACT: Smartphone-based technology is increasingly used in veterinary medicine as a complementary tool for cardiac auscultation and ECG recording. This prospective observational study evaluates a digital stethoscope (DS) that consists of simultaneous phonocardiographic and one-lead ECG recording (dECG) in adult horses, comparing it with auscultation using a conventional stethoscope (CS) and reference base-apex ECG (rECG). A total of 104 horses underwent cardiac auscultation using CSs and DSs to detect arrhythmias and murmurs. Audio and dECG were acquired using the DS. The rECG tracings were also recorded. All ECG tracings were blindly evaluated for interpretability, measurements, and diagnosis. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the data distribution. Weighted Cohen’s κ and Bland Altman plot analysis were applied to verify the agreement between reference vs. smartphone-based methods. Almost perfect agreement was found in detecting murmurs and/or arrhythmias between auscultation with the CS and DS, and between CS auscultation and re-listening to DS audio. Perfect agreement was observed between re-listening to DS audio and DS auscultation and in detecting murmur timing between CS and DS auscultation. Almost perfect agreement was found between rECG and dECG in detecting bradycardia, tachycardia, or normal heart rate (HR) and for P-wave polarity. The lack of variability with both methods for QRS polarity prevented statistical analyses from being performed. Fair agreement was found in the assessment of the presence of artifact. In conclusion, the DS reliably detected heart murmurs and arrhythmias through direct auscultation and re-listening to recordings, and accurately evaluated HR, wave and interval measurements, P-wave and QRS-complex polarities in adult horses. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: In horses, systemic calcinosis is a rare syndrome characterised by muscle lesion associated with the mineralisation of large muscle groups or other organs, in the absence of an alternative cause for the calcification, such as toxic, enzootic or metabolic. Molecular and histopathological aspects of the disease are still poorly elucidated. Objectives: To describe the epidemiological, pathological and molecular aspects of systemic calcinosis in a convenience sample of six horses submitted to necropsy in the Southern and Midwestern regions of Brazil. Study design: Retrospective exploratory study. Methods: Post-mortem necropsy records of six horses with a cause of death compatible with systemic calcinosis, were reviewed followed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, microbiology and molecular investigation. Results: The affected horses were all Quarter Horses with a mean age of 16.8 months, and an average disease course of 15.5 days. Muscle necrosis and mononuclear infiltration were observed in all animals in association with mineral deposition variably affecting the muscle tissue and/or other organs such as heart, lung and kidney. All tested animals (5/6) showed positive PCR results for the E321G MYH1 gene variant, which encodes the heavy chain of fast-contracting skeletal muscle myosin and is associated with myopathy. Three horses demonstrated positive immunostaining for Streptococcus equi, which is a known trigger for immune responses. Main limitations: The study was limited by the small sample size, molecular evaluation was not completed in one animal due to technical limitations, lack of pre-mortem evaluation of calcium metabolism and lack of accurate descriptions in the necropsy reports of involvement of each muscle individually. Conclusions: In horses, systemic calcinosis syndrome causes immune-mediated muscle lesions in association with calcification of organs and tissues, varying greatly among animals. The E321G MYH1 variant was present in all horses tested for the variant and could be involved in the pathophysiology of systemic calcinosis. © 2025 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Understanding of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is complicated by disparities among studies. Objective: Compare clinical findings and outcome in horses involved in 2 recent EHM outbreaks. Animals: Twenty-five and 10 horses affected during 2 natural EHM outbreaks were admitted to a veterinary teaching hospital (VTH) in 2021 and 2023, respectively. Methods: Data collected from the VTH and surveys completed by riders and horse owners were analyzed retrospectively. Results: No risk factors associated with EHM development showed significant differences between the outbreaks; both outbreaks were caused by A2254/N752 strains. Treatments administered for EHM were not significantly different, whereas the duration was longer in 2021 for flunixin meglumine (P =.01) and dimethyl sulfoxide (P <.001). In 2021, more horses required hospitalization (P =.02), and fatality rate was 32%, whereas in 2023, no patient died. Hospitalization duration was longer in 2021 than in 2023 (P =.06) and 11.7% of horses from 2021 returned to competition within 6 months, whereas 100% in 2023 did (P <.001). Ataxia grade upon admission was equivalent in 2021 and 2023, but factors related to poor prognosis, such as simultaneous development of urinary and vascular complications, occurred in 2021 but not in 2023 (P =.01). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Two EHM outbreaks caused by the A2254/N752 strain differed in disease severity. Urinary complications and systemic signs of vasculitis were important clinical variables associated with prognosis. Systemic complications in horses with EHM lead to a worse prognosis. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Equine influenza virus (EIV) can be transmitted by inhalation of aerosolized droplets, direct contact, and contaminated fomites. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports of the recovery of EIV from the air surrounding infected horses. Here, we evaluated whether EIV can be recovered from the air in the stalls of experimentally infected horses by using an air sampler. Furthermore, we examined whether rapid molecular test kits with reaction times of less than 30 min can detect EIV from air samples for potential field application. Two horses kept in individual stalls were experimentally infected with EIV. Air samples were collected daily by using an air sampler until 13 days post-inoculation (dpi). Viral genes were detected in 26 out of 28 air samples from both horses at 1–13 dpi by real-time RT-PCR. A rapid molecular test kit based on real-time RT-PCR detected viral genes in 23 air samples from one horse at 1–9 and 12 dpi, and from the other at 1–13 dpi. These findings confirm that horses infected with EIV shed the virus into the air. Air sampling is safe for humans and horses and avoids the potential for injury when nasopharyngeal swabs need to be collected from untrained or aggressive horses. EIV RNA was detected in the air samples by using real-time RT-PCR or the rapid molecular test kit before the horses showed clinical signs. Thus, air samplers can detect EIV RNA as early as possible through routine testing in locations such as quarantine facilities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory disorders (RDs) are a common transport-related welfare consequence in horses. This prospective study described the journeys of horses transported to two slaughterhouses in Italy, documented the prevalence of potentially RD-related pathogens, and identified possible predisposing factors. Data were recorded from arrival until 48 h after arrival and included the collection of Deep Nasopharyngeal Swabs (DNS), journey details and welfare assessment of horses (n = 155). PCR was used to quantify the presence of influenza A virus, reovirus, equine herpesvirus type 1 and 4, adenovirus, rhinovirus, astrovirus, equine coronavirus, Pasteurellaceae, Streptococcus equi sub. equi and sub. zooepidemicus. One horse each tested positive for reovirus, and rhinovirus and two horses tested positive for adenovirus. The prevalence of Streptococcus equi and zooepidemicus and Pasteurellaceae was 4 %, 19 % and 63 % respectively. Streptococcaceae and Pasteurellaceae were associated with sweating (P < 0.001). In addition, Streptococcaceae was associated with abnormal demeanour (P = 0.003), nasal or ocular discharge (P < 0.001) and higher compromised welfare after transport (P < 0.001). The multivariable regression analysis showed that broken horses departing from Eastern Europe or France were more likely to test positive for Streptococcaceae than unbroken horses coming from Poland (model P < 0.001), while broken horses subjected to short stops en route were more likely to test positive for Pasteurellaceae than unbroken horses on journeys without stops (model P < 0.001). Our findings increase the understanding of predisposing factors for RDs and may be useful in the implementation of regulations to protect the welfare of horse during transport. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: The optimal amount of vitamin D required for the proper functioning of the immune system differs from the amount necessary for bone homeostasis. Furthermore, vitamin D metabolism varies among horses. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of information regarding reference values for vitamin D in horses, particularly in the Turkmen breed. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)Vit D) in Turkmen, Thoroughbred and mixed Turkmen × Thoroughbred horses and to explore the effects of various factors on it and its relationship with serum biochemical variables and signalment data. Methods: For the measurement of 25(OH)Vit D, 90 healthy horses (min age: 6 months; max age: 10 years) that were stable in the north of Iran (37°17′ N, 55°18′ E) were selected for clinical examination and complete blood biochemistry analysis. The horses were categorised into different groups based on sex, season (spring, n = 45; autumn, n = 45), breed (Turkmen, Thoroughbred and mixed Turkmen × Thoroughbred), age (< 2 years, 2–8 years and > 8 years) and skin colour. Sampling was performed only once from each horse. Results: In this study, the median serum concentration of 25(OH)Vit D in the sampled horses was 17.42 ng/mL (IQR: 9.82–30.85). The serum 25(OH)Vit D concentration was significantly lower in autumn (median: 15.83 ng/mL and IQR: 8.67–54.68) than in spring (median: 18.02 ng/mL and IQR: 13.77–27.54) and was also lower in Turkmen horses (median: 15.83 ng/mL and IQR: 11.63–23.12) than in mixed breed horses (median: 17.72 ng/mL and IQR: 8.94–51.67) (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, the season had a significant effect on the serum 25(OH)Vit D concentration, and this difference was also observed between Turkmen horses and mixed-bred horses (p ≤ 0.05). It is unclear whether the time of sun exposure or vitamin D content of diet causes the seasonal difference of 25(OH)Vit D concentration. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Neuroepithelial neoplasms present in the ventricular system originate from the cells lining the choroid plexus and can be benign or malignant, such as choroid plexus carcinoma. A four-year-old equine presenting with a fifteen-day history of neurological symptoms was sent for veterinary evaluation. Upon examination, the horse exhibited apathy, severe ataxia, head tilt, circling behavior, head pressing, decreased tail tone, anosmia, absence of menace response, lack of facial sensitivity, and lingual hypotonia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed mixed pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. Following the animal’s death, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinoma in the third ventricle. It is concluded that horses may develop central nervous system tumors, such as choroid plexus carcinoma, with nonspecific clinical symptoms, ineffective clinical treatment, and a conclusive diagnosis established postmortem. © 2025, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

ABSTRACT: Milk powder, a nutrient-rich dairy product, lacks comprehensive information summarizing its specific properties when produced by spray- and freeze-dried technologies from different sources. Therefore, this study investigated the differences in physicochemical properties, microstructure, and proteome of spray- and freeze-dried milk powders from bovine, goat, and horse sources. The results revealed that spray-dried milk powder exhibited a smaller particle size, lower air content within the powder particles, inferior reconstitution properties, and lower lactose crystallinity compared with freeze-dried milk powder. Additionally, among the studied varieties, horse milk powder showed the lowest flowability but the most effective reconstitution properties. Proteomic analysis indicated that freeze-dried milk powder exhibited higher levels of immune-related proteins, including complement C3, C7, and complement factor B, and antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase compared with spray-dried milk powder. Furthermore, specific milk powders contained more immune-related proteins such as serum amyloid A, myeloid antimicrobial peptide-28, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and mucin-1 compared with bovine milk powder. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the differences in the physicochemical properties and potential biological functions of spray- and freeze-dried milk powders from various sources, which may help in further optimizing specific milk powder processing technologies. © 2025 American Dairy Science Association

ABSTRACT: Monitoring gestation and predicting parturition in mares with unknown breeding dates is challenging, especially in pasture bred herds of bucking horses. Transrectal ultrasonographic measurement of fetal vitreous body length is a validated predictor of foaling dates, but previous research suggested a need for breed-specific parameters to develop accurate indices for respective breeds. This study aimed to develop a scale associating fetal vitreous body length with days before parturition (DBP) in bucking horses. Biannual data collection over 2 years identified 199 pregnancies out of 240 reproductive examinations, of which 155 fetal eyes were successfully identified and measured (78 %). Foaling dates confirmed for 131 successful fetal eye examinations (n = 131) enabled DBP calculation. A single transrectal ultrasonographic measurement was collected of the length of the fetal eye measured to the maximum dimensions of the vitreous body at the level of the lens, ranging from 9 to 35 mm. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression methodology yielded the curvilinear equation DBP= -0.163(fetal eye length measurement in mm) 2 + 268.949 (r = 0.881, p < 0.001, concordance=0.994, average difference -0.077±17.214 days), which accurately calculates DBP in bucking horses based on transrectal ultrasonographic measurement of the fetal eye. Although this newly developed equation is similar to a previously reported equation for use in small ponies, applying the equation used for DBP prediction in small ponies to bucking horse pregnancies resulted in a small, but significant underestimation in predicting bucking horse DBP. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In recent decades, the integration of horses (Equus ferus) in European rewilding initiatives has gained widespread popularity due to their potential for regulating vegetation and restoring natural ecosystems. However, employing horses in conservation efforts presents important challenges, which we here explore and discuss. These challenges encompass the lack of consensus on key terms inherent to conservation and rewilding, the entrenched culture and strong emotions associated with horses, low genetic diversity and high susceptibility to hereditary diseases in animals under human selection, as well as insufficient consideration for the social behaviour of horses in wild-living populations. In addition, management of wild-living horses involves intricate welfare, ethics and legislative dimensions. Anthropocentric population-control initiatives may be detrimental to horse group structures since they tend to prioritise individual welfare over the health of populations and ecosystems. To overcome these challenges, we provide comprehensive recommendations. These involve a systematic acquisition of genetic information, a focus on genetic diversity rather than breed purity and minimal veterinary intervention in wild-living populations. Further, we advise allowing for natural top-down and bottom-up control – or, if impossible, simulating this by culling or non-lethal removal of horses – instead of using fertility control for population management. We advocate for intensified collaboration between conservation biologists and practitioners and enhanced communication with the general public. Decision-making should be informed by a thorough understanding of the genetic makeup, common health issues and dynamics, and social behaviour in wild-living horse populations. Such a holistic approach is essential to reconcile human emotions associated with horses with the implementation of conservation practices that are not only effective but also sustainable for the long-term viability of functional, biodiverse ecosystems, while rehabilitating the horse as a widespread wild-living species in Europe. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Biofilm-associated infections (BAIs) continue to pose a major challenge in the medical field. Nanomedicine, in particular, promises significant advances in combating BAIs through the introduction of a variety of nanomaterials and nano-antimicrobial strategies. However, studies to date have primarily focused on the removal of the bacterial biofilm and neglect the subsequent post-biofilm therapeutic measures for BAIs, rendering pure anti-biofilm strategies insufficient for the holistic recovery of affected patients. Herein, we construct an emerging dual-functional composite nanosheet (SiHx@Ga) that responds to pHs fluctuation in the biofilm microenvironment to enable a sequential therapy of BAIs. In the acidic environment of biofilm, SiHx@Ga employs the self-sensitized photothermal Trojan horse strategy to effectively impair the reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense system while triggering oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation of bacteria, engendering potent antibacterial and anti-biofilm effects. Surprisingly, in the post-treatment phase, SiHx@Ga adsorbs free pathogenic nucleic acids released after biofilm destruction, generates hydrogen with ROS-scavenging and promotes macrophage polarization to the M2 type, effectively mitigating damaging inflammatory burst and promoting tissue healing. This well-orchestrated strategy provides a sequential therapy of BAIs by utilizing microenvironmental variations, offering a conceptual paradigm shift in the field of nanomedicine anti-infectives. © 2024

ABSTRACT: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is often associated with poor prognosis due to high rates of drug resistance and relapse. In this study, the researchers developed a Trojan horse nanotherapeutic strategy that leverages exosomes produced by T-ALL cells to deliver Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) to conquer drug resistant T-ALL. This innovative exosomal drug delivery platform, derived from T-ALL resistant cell lines, is recognized and absorbed by leukemia cells in vivo, enabling targeted enrichment in the bone marrow. Consequently, it facilitates the delivery and release of ISL (the ’soldier’), aiming to enhance therapeutic selectivity and overcome drug resistance. The anticancer effects of ISL and exosome-encapsulated ISL (Exo-ISL) on drug-resistant T-ALL cells were evaluated through biological assays, cell line-derived xenograft (CDX), and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, RNA sequencing, acridine orange staining, comet assays, and γ-H2AX immunofluorescence were performed. Our findings demonstrate that T-ALL-derived exosomes significantly enhance the targeted delivery of ISL to the bone marrow. Furthermore, ISL's effects on drug-resistant T-ALL have been found to involve multiple mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis, DNA damage, and autophagy. © 2025 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The metabolic and lipid profiles of horses treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are not well understood. This retrospective study evaluated blood parameters in hyperinsulinemic horses treated with either ertugliflozin (0.05 mg/kg) or dapagliflozin (0.02 mg/kg) orally once daily. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 0) and after 7 and/or 30 days of treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank, Mann-Whitney and Spearman's rank correlation tests. Thirty-four horses received dapagliflozin and 24 received ertugliflozin. Significant (p<0.05) within-horse changes between day 0 and day 30 included [median, inter-quartile range (IQR)]: basal serum [Insulin] (uU/ml) reduced 170 (92-280) to 28.7 (14.5-90); [triglycerides] (mmol/l) increased 0.5 (0.3-0.6) to 1.0 (0.6-1.56), [β-hydroxybutyrate] (umol/l) increased 0.22 (0.17-2.7) to 0.30 (0.24-0.35); [total cholesterol] (mmol/l) increased 2.36 (2-2.6) to 2.84 (2.4-3.7); and GGT (IU/ml) increased 21 (16-32) to 25 (18-38). As a percentage of total serum lipids, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) reduced 52.4 % (47.9 %-61.0 %) to 50 % (41 %-54.8 %) and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) increased 10.4 % (6.4 %-14.4 %) to 12.3 % (9.9 %-16.8 %) (all p<0.05). Differences between ertugliflozin and dapagliflozin groups were not significant in any of these parameters at days 0, 7 or 30. At day 30, 10/48 (21 %) cases had [triglycerides] > 2.0 mmol/l (maximum = 10.8mmol/l). Day 30 [triglyceride] correlated with day 0: basal insulin (rho=0.47); [triglyceride] (rho=0.42); %VLDL (rho=0.34) day 30: [total cholesterol] (rho=0.67), %HDL (rho=-0.432) and %VLDL (rho=0.708). Our findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors induce minor changes in lipid profiles, with occasional cases of marked hypertriglyceridemia, and that dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin exhibit similar biochemical effects. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The study analysed the results of show-jumping competitions of 41 warmblood horses of varying reproductive status, age and per-sonality. In total, 8 stallions, 18 mares, and 15 geldings were included. Horses were divided in the following age groups: young horses 4-7 years old (n=15), mature horses 8-13 years old (n=13) and older horses 14-20 years old (n=13). Horses were also divided according to dominant personality component, obtained by questionnaires: excitability (n=4), protection (n=7), sociability (n=15), curiosity (n=9), horses without a dominant personality component (n=6). Horses in this study were compared to the results of showjumping competitions of the Croatian Equestrian Federation in the past two consecutive years, considering data from 80 classes, 44 tournaments and 3280 starts. The Winter Cup (1.10-1.3) was considered the time of absence of cyclicity in mares while the Summer Cup (1.3-1.10) was considered the full season of reproductive cyclicity of mares. The aim of the study was to determine correlations between the dominant personality component, reproductive status and age of the horse in obtaining optimal results in show-jumping competitions. Based on the results, the dominant personality component posi-tively influences the horse’s success in show-jumping (ranking, penalties). Excitable horses had the poorest results, especially during the reproductive season (P<0.05). Protective horses had the best results regardless of season. It is likely that determination of the dominant personality component could help in better selection of showjumping horses. Geldings had the least seasonal variations, while mares had significantly better results out of season (P<0.05). Stallions also had better results out of season, though the difference was not statistically significant. Recommendations include introducing methods of cycle blockage in mares to improve focus and results in all cate-gories. Contrary to expectations, older horses (14-20 years old) obtained better results than mature horses (8-13 years old). Further research of all observed parameters on a significantly higher sample of showjumpers is required to determine whether the findings here could be applied to the complete population of warmblood horses used in showjumping competitions in Croatia and abroad. © 2025, Croatian Veterinary Institute.

ABSTRACT: Copy number variations (CNVs) have become widely acknowledged as a significant source of genomic variability and phenotypic variance. To understand the genetic variants in horses, CNVs from six Indian horse breeds, namely, Manipuri, Zanskari, Bhutia, Spiti, Kathiawari and Marwari were discovered using Axiom™ Equine Genotyping Array. These breeds differed in agro-climatic adaptation with distinct phenotypic characters. A total of 2668 autosomal CNVs and 381 CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified with PennCNV tool. DeepCNV was employed to re-validate to get 883 autosomal CNVs, of which 9.06% were singleton type. A total of 180 CNVRs were identified after DeepCNV filtering with the estimated length of 3.12 Kb–4.90 Mb. The functional analysis showed the majority of the CNVRs genes enriched for sensory perception and olfactory receptor activity. An Equine CNVs database, EqCNVdb (http://backlin.cabgrid.res.in/eqcnvdb/) was developed which catalogues detailed information on the horse CNVs, CNVRs and gene content within CNVRs. Also, three random CNVRs were validated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. These findings will aid in the understanding the horse genome and serve as a preliminary foundation for future CNV association research with commercially significant equine traits. The identification of CNVs and CNVRs would lead to better insights into genetic basis of important traits. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Understanding social relationships in at-risk species held in captivity is vital for their welfare and potential reintroduction. In social species like the Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), daily time allocation and space use may be influenced by social structure and, in turn, reflect welfare. Here, we identify social relationships, time budgets, and spatial distribution of a group of nine older (aged 6–21 years) male Przewalski’s horses living in a non-breeding (bachelor) group. We conducted our work at the Askania-Nova Biosphere Reserve, over 65 h of observation in summer, 2015. Horses formed stronger social bonds with individuals of similar gregariousness and dominance levels. Social-network analysis identified three distinct subgroups with significant differences in locomotion, social behaviour, and foraging. However, resting and vigilance behaviour remained similar across the subgroups. Behavioural synchrony across all activities was higher within subgroups than between. Space use was also affected by subgroup membership, with some horses overusing or underusing critical resource areas like hay and water. These findings suggest opportunities to improve welfare by adjusting space and resource distribution, particularly for more submissive individuals. Our approach may also aid in selecting reintroduction candidates by considering social characteristics alongside health, genetic, and other factors. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of nosocomial infection which at times causes a grim situation in clinical setups. There is a dire need to develop strategies to overcome the increasing incidence of drug resistance in this organism. The protective outer membrane and over expressed efflux pumps serve as a major survival weapon for this pathogen, making it to resist present day antibiotics. The present review dwells on some of these strategies, with emphasis on tagging to existing antibiotics with siderophore as a carrier employing a Trojan horse strategy so that an antibiotic can creep into bacterial cell through the iron acquisition pathway. These hybrid drugs, defined as synthetic structures are likely to overcome drug resistance due to their ability to evade resistance mediated by multiple antibiotic resistance operon. The advances and challenges of siderophore-antibiotic conjugates are elaborated in this article. Moreover, several xeno-siderophore-antibiotic conjugates, currently in clinical trials, have been discussed. The present review provides insights into repurposing of fluroquinolones through siderophore targeted delivery to increase the biological activity of antibiotics. In the near future, siderophore—based Trojan horse antibiotics indeed will not only help in altering the potency of antibiotics, hence decreasing antimicrobial resistance, but also will lead to disarming the pathogen of its virulence. © Association of Microbiologists of India 2025.

ABSTRACT: Excessive growth of granulation tissue (EGT) is a common complication during wound healing in horses. Wounds involving lower limbs are especially prone to the development of EGT. Often increased expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is found in the EGT. In the present report, resveratrol was used as TGF-β modifier. Topical application of an aqueous solution of resveratrol at 0.01 mg/mL once daily for 5‒7 weeks depending on EGT size, successfully suppressed the EGT growth in all seven horses in the present case report. © 2025 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of warmblood horses in the Czech Republic based on the results of the Criteria of Young Horses (CYH) breeding competitions. In this study, we focused on the evaluation of horses in jumping competitions for mares, stallions and geldings aged 4–6 years. The statistical evaluation is based on the official CYH methodology, which takes into account the different difficulty of competitions for horses of different ages. Data from 2017 to 2021 were used for the evaluation. During this period, 645 horses participated in the competitions with 2691 starts. The statistical analysis evaluated the influence of age, sex, country of origin and breed group on the performance of the horses. Analysis of variance was used for comparison and Scheffe's test was used for subsequent post hoc analysis. Six-year-old horses were rated the highest (22.95 points) despite receiving the highest penalty points (3.29 penalty points). In the sex analysis, the overall rating for stallions was highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) higher than that of geldings and mares. Stallions were the least represented in terms of numbers (22.33 %), but they had the highest number of starts per horse (4.75 starts) and the best mean score (23.32 points). A total of 76.12 % of the horses that participated in the CYH were of Czech breeding, but their scores were statistically highly significant lower (P ≤ 0.01) than those of imported horses, with a difference in mean scores of 0.91 points. In terms of breed, the most numerous breeds were the Czech Warmblood (43.26 %) and then the Czech Sport Horse (17.52 %), but these breeds were below average in the overall evaluation (CZEWB 22.53 points, CSH 22.48 points). The third most represented breed was the Holstein horse, which, on the contrary, achieved the best average results (22.83 points) and the performance of representatives of this breed differed highly significantly (P ≤ 0.01) from most other breeds. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Shortened egg reappearance periods (ERP) have been seen as an early warning of anthelmintic resistance development in cyathostomins in horses. The hypothesis has been that in these instances, efficacy against egg laying adult cyathostomins remains high, but a decline in activity against later larval stages leads to the earlier resumption of egg shedding after treatment. In this study using a single herd of horses we investigated the ERP of a number of commonly used equine anthelmintics and examined whether ERP might show seasonal variation between winter and summer. Four main Faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT1–4) were conducted respectively in Winter (Jun/Jul) 2019, Summer (Jan/Feb) 2020, Winter 2020 and Summer 2021. The tests examined the efficacy and ERP of ivermectin, moxidectin, abamectin and fenbendazole. Egg counts of two groups of horses were monitored before and for 6–7 weeks after treatment - however long it took for counts to return to at least 10 % of what they had been before treatment. One additional FECRT was also conducted, using a second abamectin-containing product (FECRT5 - Spring 2020). Treatment with ivermectin (FECRT1–4), moxidectin (FECRT 1–2) and the first abamectin product tested (FECRT3) all reduced egg counts by >99 % for 4 weeks after treatment, with ERP of 5–7 weeks and with minimal differences between the 3 treatments. There was a tendency for counts to rise more rapidly in summer, and in the second year of testing as opposed to the first. Both the second abamectin product (FECRT5) and the fenbendazole (FECRT4) were found to be ineffective, reducing egg counts immediately after treatment by 68 and 52 % respectively. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) is a highly sensitive and specific marker of myocardial injury detectable in plasma by immunoassay techniques. Inclusion criteria over a 3-year period required a diagnosis of cardiac disease accompanied by electrocardiographic (ECG) and cardiac ultrasound examinations (n = 23) in adult horses (≥2 years of age). A second group of normal adult ponies (n = 12) was studied as a reference group. Heparinized jugular venous blood samples were collected and centrifuged within 30 min, and the plasma was separated and frozen at −70 °C for subsequent batched cTnI analysis. The lower limit of detection was 0.01 ng/mL, and the upper limit was 100 ng/mL of plasma. Normal equine plasma cTnI concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 0.03 ng/mL (n = 12). Horses with non-arrhythmogenic murmurs (n = 4) included tricuspid (0.05 ng/mL cTnI), mitral (0.07), and aortic insufficiencies (0.01, 0.02). Horses with benign atrial fibrillation (n = 8) had a cTnI range of <0.01–0.09 ng/mL, with four horses having cTnI concentrations falling slightly outside the reference range (0.04, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.09). Horses with ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular premature contractions or ventricular tachycardia) and documentable myocardial toxicities or immunological reactions (n = 5) had cTnI concentrations of 0.05, 0.21, 0.31, 15.18, and >100 ng/mL. Horses with ventricular arrhythmias but no documentation of myocardial toxicity (n = 3) had cTnI concentrations of 0.34, 0.46, and 80.42 ng/mL. When grouped by arrhythmia type and compared using the Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test, the median ventricular arrhythmia cTnI (0.40 ng/mL) was significantly higher than the median atrial fibrillation cTnI (0.04 ng/mL, p < 0.001). It was concluded that horses with myocardial toxicities and ventricular arrhythmias often had severe elevations in plasma cTnI. © 2025 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Wild horses and burros are a unique economic asset that enjoys federal protections that are stronger than those afforded to most other wildlife. Management challenges are evident in current populations that exceed targets by as much as four times. The imbalance between management targets and reality has grown in recent years, concomitant with mounting fiscal and opportunity costs. Programmatic tweaks have not been able to materially change the reality on the ground. Continuation on the current trajectory is unsustainable. An economic perspective provides key insights into the management problem and provides clarity about the requirements for a durable solution. A comprehensive reform is needed to achieve biological and fiscal sustainability. This includes initial excess removals to reduce overpopulation and then strict adherence to targets. Such a program offers a real present discounted fiscal savings of over $1 billion. © 2024 The Society for Range Management

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is an economically important upper respiratory tract (URT) disease with a genetic contribution to risk, but genetic variants independent of height have not been identified for Thoroughbreds. The method of clinical assessment for RLN is critical to accurately phenotype groups for genetic studies. Objectives: To identify genetic risk loci for RLN in Thoroughbreds in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) following high-resolution phenotyping. Study design: Case–control. Methods: Thoroughbred horses were characterised as RLN cases and controls using resting and exercising URT endoscopic examinations and laryngeal ultrasonography, with the case-cohort supplemented using a questionnaire. Genotypes for 43 831 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from n = 235 horses (n = 110 cases; n = 125 controls) were used to estimate trait heritability and identify significantly associated SNPs in a GWAS. Haplotypes were examined in cases and controls and risk allele frequencies were examined in a population cohort (n = 3126). Results: Heritability was h2 = 0.30 including sex and 5PCs as covariates. A SNP on ECA20 located between candidate genes, DAAM2 and LRFN2, was significantly associated with RLN. Six index SNPs with allelic effect sizes OR = 1.5–2.9 were identified on ECA1, ECA14, and ECA20 close to candidate genes ATPA10, KCNN2, and TFAP2A. Eleven ECA20 SNPs defined seven haplotypes with homozygous H2/H2 horses having a 3.1× higher risk of RLN. Risk alleles segregate in the population, and stallions are carriers. Main limitations: The main study population was young. Horses in the control group had no evidence of RLN as 2- or 3-year olds but may have developed RLN later. Conclusions: Genetic markers for RLN were identified which may be useful for the development of a polygenic risk score. Candidate genes with functions in neuropathies may further the understanding of RLN pathobiology. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The equine bloodworm, Strongylus vulgaris, is a highly pathogenic parasite causing potentially fatal vascular and intestinal damage. Parasites express and release microRNAs (miRNAs) for internal regulation and to modulate host immunity. The complete set of miRNAs expressed by S. vulgaris (the S. vulgaris miRNAome) remains unannotated and the aim of this study was to annotate the miRNAome of L4 and L5 stages of S. vulgaris, and to examine differences in miRNA abundance between larval stages and sexes. Furthermore, we aimed to determine if miRNAs were detectable in excretory/secretory products (ESPs) from larvae and in arterial tissue from their predilection site, the cranial mesenteric artery (CMA). Larvae were collected from naturally infected foals, and categorized by sex and stage. A subset of larvae was snap-frozen, while those remaining were incubated and the (ESPs) collected. Arterial tissue samples were collected from the CMA. Small RNA sequencing, followed by a custom bioinformatic pipeline, was used for annotation. We identified 142 S. vulgaris miRNAs in larvae and 136 in ESPs. Significant differences in miRNA abundance were observed between larvae and ESPs, and between L5 females (L5Fs) and L5 males (L5Ms), L4s and L5Fs, and L4s and L5Ms. No differences were found between L4s and L5s overall. In ESPs, several miRNAs were differentially abundant across all groups. Validation through quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) detected selected miRNAs and their differential abundance in larvae and ESPs. One parasite-derived miRNA was detected in some of the horse arterial tissue samples but at very low levels. This study provided the first annotation of the S. vulgaris miRNAome. Most of the annotated larval miRNAs were also detectable in ESPs, and differences in miRNA abundance between sexes were found for larvae, and between sexes and stages for ESPs. Parasite-derived miRNAs were, however, not consistently detectable in the surrounding host arterial tissue. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To establish the reference interval (RI) of fecal calprotectin (fCP) and fCP:protein ratio in the feces of healthy horses and demonstrate preliminary clinical utility for the quantification of intestinal inflammation. METHODS Feces were collected from healthy horses (n = 103) and horses with colic (n = 15) or colitis (n = 13). Feces were suspended in buffer to create fecal supernatant. Fecal calprotectin concentration was determined by ELISA, fecal total protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay, and the fCP:protein ratio was calculated. Reference intervals for fCP and fCP:protein ratio were calculated from healthy horses. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to evaluate associations between fCP concentration and fCP:protein ratio with group and other clinical features. The study period was from September 20, 2023, through April 20, 2024. RESULTS The RI for fCP was 0.056 to 0.278 μg/mL; 4 of 13 colitis cases had fCP above the RI. The RI for fCP:protein was 6.6 X 10−6 to 4.9 X 10−5; 5 of 13 colitis cases and 2 of 15 colic cases had fCP:protein above the RI. Horses with colitis had significantly greater fCP (median [quartile 1, quartile 3], 0.234 [0.194, 0.279] μg/mL) than healthy horses (0.196 [0.138, 0.220] μg/mL) or colic cases (0.189 [0.164, 0.215] μg/mL). There was a greater difference in fCP:protein ratio between colitis cases (4.31 X 10−5 [3.19 X 10−5, 6.23 X 10−5]) and both healthy horses (2.19 X 10−5 [1.58 X 10−5, 2.88 X 10−5]) and colic cases (1.52 X 10−5 [1.22 X 10−5, 3.56 X 10−5]). CONCLUSIONS Both fCP and fCP:protein ratio were increased in horses in colitis; additional work is needed to establish clinical utility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE There are few reliable diagnostic modalities for inflammation of the equine large colon. With additional development of a clinically applicable test and validation in larger population, fecal calprotectin may facilitate noninvasive quantification of intestinal inflammation in horses. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: The unique horse and pony breeds of India are declining at an alarming rate. These horses have been integral to the Indian culture and customs for centuries and represent a valuable genetic resource. It is imperative to harness the potential of this equine genetic resource that urgently needs conservation. The study highlights the design and development of a high density SNP array, the Axiom_Ashwa to aid in the genetic analysis and conservation efforts for Indian horse and pony breeds. With 613,950 SNPs, this chip offers extensive genome coverage having an average inter-marker distance of 4 kb. The Axiom_Ashwa has been validated on a larger set of diverse indigenous samples as well as Thoroughbreds, demonstrating a high call rate of 99.4% and robustness for genotyping indigenous breeds. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed higher average LD in Indian breeds compared to exotic breeds, suggesting a limited effective population size and recent bottlenecks. Phylogenetic and population stratification analyses using PCA and DAPC clearly distinguished horses, ponies and Thoroughbreds, confirming the efficacy of the Axiom_Ashwa chip. These findings underscore the urgent need for conservation efforts for Indian horse breeds, which have experienced significant drop in population size. The Axiom_Ashwa SNP chip offers advantages such as cost-effectiveness and high throughput, providing a more accurate genetic representation of Indian horses. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine the causes, time to resolution, effect of therapeutics, and ocular sequelae of hyphema, fibrin, and/or vitreal hemorrhage in horses. ANIMALS 225 horses (219 eyes) who were diagnosed with hyphema, fibrin, and/or vitreal hemorrhage. METHODS Records were retrospectively reviewed for the horses. Signalment, ophthalmic examination findings, causes, treatments, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Common causes of intraocular fibrin or hemorrhage were equine recurrent uveitis (42/219 horses), corneal stromal abscess (32/219 horses), corneal stromal ulcer (25/219 horses), and trauma (21/219 horses). Eyes with fibrin that were treated with intracameral tissue plasminogen activator (TPA; n = 18 eyes) had significantly lower days to resolution (8.9 ± 12.6 days) compared to eyes not treated with TPA (28.3 ± 46.7 days). Ocular sequelae in horses with fibrin, such as cataracts (18/120 eyes), synechiae (11/120 eyes), and vision loss (17/120 eyes), were significantly less common in eyes treated with TPA. Sequelae in eyes with hyphema included cataracts (9/36 eyes), synechiae (6/36 eyes), and vision loss (5/36 eyes). Although 41 horses had an enucleation at presentation because of severe disease, 14/144 (< 10%) of horses with follow-up required an enucleation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The presence of blood products in the eyes of horses suggests severe ocular disease, but if the eye is not enucleated at presentation, the prognosis is good for maintaining the eye. Also, the use of intracameral TPA in horses with anterior chamber fibrin but not those with hyphema, results in less adverse ocular sequelae. ©The authors.

ABSTRACT: Pasture tracks are a modern equine housing trend often implemented as a weight control strategy due to the belief that they promote movement, though this is not proven experimentally. To test movement of horses housed in pasture tracks as compared to conventional pasture housing, two experiments were performed using a track (0.2ha, 3.5m in width, 561 m total distance) created around the perimeter of a 2.0 ha pasture. In experiment 1, eight horses were paired and rotated between three treatment locations: track (T), small 2 ha pasture housed within the track (SP), and a larger 20 ha pasture on the same farm (LP). A GPS-equipped watch attached to the crown piece of a halter tracked movement of horses over a ten-week study as they rotated in pairs to each location, with testing in all locations occurring simultaneously. Environmental impacts of housing were evaluated by comparing vegetative biomass and soil relocation throughout the study. In experiment 2, the same horses (n = 8) were rotated in isolated pairs to T or SP, with only one pair of horses tested at a time to ensure that social influences did not confound movement data. Collective results indicate that horses traveled approximately the same distance in T as compared to SP or LP. However, detrimental environmental impacts resulted from the track, including a decrease in vegetative biomass and greater sediment deposition from runoff. Potential environmental impacts should be further investigated to develop best management practices to mitigate erosion caused by pasture tracks. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping, previously performed in horses with atrial arrhythmias, has demonstrated the medial region of the caudal vena cava (CaVC), 1–8 cm caudal to the fossa ovalis, as an anatomical predilection site for atrial tachycardia associated with areas of slow conduction and conduction block. Slow conduction has also been recorded in the cranial vena cava (CrVC). Objectives: To investigate the morphological characteristics of the myocardial sleeves (MS) in the CaVC and CrVC, in order to identify a potential substrate of right sided atrial arrhythmias. Study design: Cross sectional. Methods: Post-mortem dissection of 37 hearts from adult warmblood horses without known cardiovascular disease. Macroscopic examination of the myocardial distribution, evaluated the MS area, length, width, and shape in the CaVC and the CrVC. At least 2 samples from each vena cava MS were histologically examined using Masson's trichrome staining. Results: Myocardial sleeves into the medial CaVC and into the CrVC were observed in all horses and showed variations in distribution, shape, and size between horses. Their mean ± standard deviation length from the limbus into the CaVC reached 5.7 ± 1.0 cm (maximum 8.3 cm), and from the azygos vein into the CrVC 5.3 ± 1.6 cm (maximum 8.6 cm). Myocardium-free islands were observed in the CaVC and CrVC in 30% and 6% of horses, respectively. Histologically, MS showed a non-uniform myocardial fibre arrangement, with presence of fibroadipose tissue, features known to result in slow conduction and pro-arrhythmia. Main limitations: Study only included horses without history of atrial arrhythmia. Conclusions: Myocardial sleeves are present in both CaVC and CrVC, showing anatomical variations between horses. Tissue characteristics known to favour re-entry were identified indicating that these venae cavae MS are a potential substrate for atrial tachyarrhythmias and a target for treatment by ablation. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 20-year-old Irish Sport Horse gelding was presented to the Royal Veterinary College Equine Referral Hospital for investigation of left-sided epistaxis, depression and gait abnormalities of approximately 1 month duration. Physical examination and cranial nerve evaluation were unremarkable. A small amount of haemorrhagic discharge was noted from the left nostril. Gait evaluation was suggestive of proprioceptive deficits. Computed tomography (CT) identified a mass lesion within the left conchofrontal and sphenopalatine sinuses extending through the cribriform plate into the calvarium. Histopathology of the mass revealed a neuroendocrine neoplasm, for which a diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma was favoured. This case highlights the usefulness of CT for the identification and extent of an intracranial mass and therefore its prognosis, however, histopathological examination was necessary to confirm the diagnosis. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe the surgical technique for removal of hoof wall masses in horses under standing sedation (SS) and local anesthesia (LA), and to report complications and long-term outcome following surgery. Study design: Observational retrospective study. Animals: Client-owned horses (n = 30). Methods: Horses undergoing keratoma removal under SS and LA in a single equine hospital between August 2016 and July 2023 were included in the study. Signalment, affected foot, history of lameness and/or foot abscesses, degree of lameness on admission, imaging findings (radiography and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] when available), location of the mass, surgical technique, remedial farriery, postoperative care, complications and outcome were recorded. Long-term follow-up information was obtained by telephone questionnaire. Results: A total of 30 horses met the inclusion criteria. Duration of lameness ranged from 1 to 289 days (mean 90 days). The degree of lameness varied from absent to grade 4/5 (AAEP) (mean grade 3/5). All horses underwent preoperative radiographic examination and 14/30 underwent MRI. All horses underwent partial hoof wall resection. The surgery was performed safely in all cases. Postoperative complications included marked lameness in the early postoperative period in 3/30 horses and exuberant granulation tissue formation in 2/30 horses. Long-term (>6 months) follow-up information was available for 28 horses, and 26/28 horses returned to previous levels of exercise. Recurrence was suspected in 1/30 horses. Conclusions: The complication rate was lower than previously reported for keratoma removal under general anesthesia (GA). Clinical significance: Removal of hoof wall masses under SS and LA can be considered as an alternative to removal under GA. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Babesia caballi is a tick-borne hemoparasite that causes equine piroplasmosis. It has a significant economic impact, decreasing performance and affecting animal welfare. This study aimed to identify B. caballi DNA in the blood of horses from households in the southwestern and western regions of Romania. We included 310 animals, from which blood was collected via EDTA. To test the samples for the B. caballi parasite genome, we used real-time PCR and conventional PCR. The prevalence of B. caballi was 5.81% (18/310) in apparently healthy horses, suggesting that this parasite is enzootic in the regions studied, although veterinarians did not indicate any symptoms resembling clinical babesiosis. In Romania, there are insufficient epidemiologic data on equine babesiosis, and the results of the present study suggest the need for further investigations into the dynamics of transmission and to identify potential prevention and control strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Studies have shown that horses are sensitive to human attentional cues. Also, there is some evidence that they might be able to infer the knowledge state of a human and communicate intentionally with us. However, this ability is not fully characterized and certain behaviors, like gaze, asymmetric ears position or vocalizations, which could work as attention-getting behaviors, have been scarcely studied in this context. The aim of the present study was to assess whether horses’ gaze toward a person, asymmetric ears position and vocalizations are subject to audience effects and adjust to human attentional cues, which would suggest a communicative function. For this purpose, we adapted a protocol used with domestic dogs [Kaminski et al. 2017] and observed horses’ spontaneous behavior (gaze, asymmetric ears position and vocalizations) in the presence of a human holding and not holding food in an attentive position (facing the horse with open eyes) and in a non-attentive position (with her back turned towards the horse). We found significant evidence of horses being sensitive to human attentional cues (reflected in the horses’ gaze duration and asymmetric position of the ears), but not of intentional communication towards humans. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: This is the first study that targets the epidemiology of Gasterophilus spp. in slaughtered horses from Romania. Previously to our research, there were five recorded species: Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis, Gasterophilus inermis, Gasterophilus intestinalis, Gasterophilus nasalis, and Gasterophilus pecorum with a dispersed distribution throughout the country, the data being recorded more than 73 years ago. The collection of Gasterophilus larvae was carried out from the digestive system (stomach, duodenum, and rectum) of horses in three abattoirs, monthly between January 2023 and December 2023. Following dissection, all larvae were stored in absolute ethanol until morphological and molecular identification. The larvae were counted and identified according to morphological keys. Overall, 394 horses were examined, of which 211 (53.6%) were infected with L2 or L3 of Gasterophilus spp. Only two species were found: G. intestinalis (prevalence 52.0%) and G. nasalis (14.0%). Coinfection with both species occurred in 49 horses (12.4%). In total, 9759 larvae were collected (7916 L3 and 1843 L2). Larvae were localized in the stomach (G. intestinalis) and duodenum (G. nasalis) of horses. There was a strong seasonal variation in the mean intensity and mean abundance for both G. intestinalis and G. nasalis larvae and also for coinfections (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between prevalence and mean intensity across gender, group age, or horse colour. Our findings show that Gasterophilus infection is widespread within Romania territory, being a possible cause of illness and welfare issues in horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Greying with age phenotype in horses involves loss of hair pigmentation whereas skin pigmentation is not reduced, and a predisposition to melanoma. The causal mutation was initially reported as a duplication of a 4.6 kb intronic sequence in Syntaxin 17. The speed of greying varies considerably among Grey horses. Here we demonstrate the presence of two different Grey alleles, G2 carrying two tandem copies of the duplicated sequence and G3 carrying three. The latter is by far the most common allele, probably due to strong selection for the striking white phenotype. Our results reveal a remarkable dosage effect where the G3 allele is associated with fast greying and high incidence of melanoma whereas G2 is associated with slow greying and low incidence of melanoma. The copy number expansion transforms a weak enhancer to a strong melanocyte-specific enhancer that underlies hair greying (G2 and G3) and a drastically elevated risk of melanoma (G3 only). Our direct pedigree-based observation of the origin of a G2 allele from a G3 allele by copy number contraction demonstrates the dynamic evolution of this locus and provides the ultimate evidence for causality of the copy number variation of the 4.6 kb intronic sequence. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The desmotomy of the palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) is recommended when it hinders the sliding motion of the flexor tendons in the sesamoidean canal, leading to persistent lameness that often does not improve with conservative treatment. Tenoscopic-assisted PAL desmotomy can be accomplished with various instruments via an intrathecal approach. However, severe constriction or adhesions within the fetlock canal can restrict manoeuvrability and access of instruments within the sheath, preventing safe and effective transection of the ligament. This case report describes the successful use of a hook knife via a subcutaneous approach to safely transect the PAL under tenoscopic visualisation in a horse where severe constriction of the fetlock canal prohibited the standard intrathecal approach. In similar chronic tenosynovitis cases, a subcutaneous approach to PAL transection at the start of the tenoscopic examination of the digital flexor tendon sheath may minimise iatrogenic injury to intrathecal structures. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Warmblood sires traditionally have been presented for stallion licencing at 2 years of age, but the age at which horses are mentally fit for training is a point of controversy. We have therefore investigated the stress response of young stallions to pretraining for licencing. Salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) were determined repeatedly over 12 weeks. Stallions were 24 and 30 months old and either housed in groups or individual boxes (Group 24, n = 9; Box 24, n = 10; Box 30, n = 10). Pretraining included free movement in an indoor arena, training in a horse walker, lunging and jumping of obstacles without rider. In addition, group-housed 18-month-old stallions (Group 18, n = 10) underwent an abbreviated programme with only free movement and horse walker exercise. We hypothesised that the stress response to pretraining is reduced by group housing but not affected by age. In stallions of all groups, cortisol concentration increased in response to pretraining events (P < 0.001). Cortisol release differed among events (P < 0.001) was most pronounced after free movement in weeks 1 and 2 and became less pronounced with event repetition (P < 0.001). When horses were in the horse walker for the first time, cortisol release was increased in group-housed in comparison to individually housed stallions (time × stable P < 0.001). An increase (P < 0.001) in heart rate differed among events (P < 0.001) and became smaller with repetition (P < 0.001). The HRV decreased transiently in response to pretraining events (P < 0.001) indicating sympathoadrenal activation. In conclusion, pretraining of young stallions is both a physical and a mental demand and induces a stress response. With the repetition of events, even stallions as young as 18 months adapted rapidly to these demands. Group housing had no stress-reducing effects. Our study does not provide evidence that the systematic pretraining of young Warmblood stallions raises animal welfare concerns. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: Culicoides biting midges exhibit a global spatial distribution and are the main vectors of several viruses of veterinary importance, including bluetongue (BT) and African horse sickness (AHS). Many environmental and anthropological factors contribute to their ability to live in a variety of habitats, which have the potential to change over the years as the climate changes. Therefore, as new habitats emerge, the risk for new introductions of these diseases of interest to occur increases. The aim of this study was to model distributions for two primary vectors for BT and AHS (Culicoides imicola and Culicoides bolitinos) using random forest (RF) machine learning and explore the relative importance of environmental and anthropological factors in a region of South Africa with frequent AHS and BT outbreaks. Methods: Culicoides capture data were collected between 1996 and 2022 across 171 different capture locations in the Western Cape. Predictor variables included climate-related variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity), environment-related variables (normalised difference vegetation index—NDVI, soil moisture) and farm-related variables (livestock densities). Random forest (RF) models were developed to explore the spatial distributions of C. imicola, C. bolitinos and a merged species map, where both competent vectors were combined. The maps were then compared to interpolation maps using the same capture data as well as historical locations of BT and AHS outbreaks. Results: Overall, the RF models performed well with 75.02%, 61.6% and 74.01% variance explained for C. imicola, C. bolitinos and merged species models respectively. Cattle density was the most important predictor for C. imicola and water vapour pressure the most important for C. bolitinos. Compared to interpolation maps, the RF models had higher predictive power throughout most of the year when species were modelled individually; however, when merged, the interpolation maps performed better in all seasons except winter. Finally, midge densities did not show any conclusive correlation with BT or AHS outbreaks. Conclusion: This study yielded novel insight into the spatial abundance and drivers of abundance of competent vectors of BT and AHS. It also provided valuable data to inform mathematical models exploring disease outbreaks so that Culicoides-transmitted diseases in South Africa can be further analysed.

ABSTRACT: Anticipatory behaviour is increasingly being recognised as a measure of animal welfare. This behaviour is linked to reward sensitivity, which reflects the balance of positive and negative experiences. This study examined anticipatory behaviour in horses fed either ad libitum or rationed diets, aiming to identify differences in behaviour patterns during the periods of one hour immediately before and after feeding. Behavioural data were collected via video surveillance over five days, focusing on the pre- and post-feeding periods of stabled horses. The data were successfully fit to Poisson models. The results indicate that ration-fed horses exhibit more stereotypic and arousal behaviours, with anticipatory behaviour intensifying closer to feeding times. These findings suggest a potential link between feeding stress and anticipatory behaviour, especially in horses on rationed diets. This study underscores the importance of considering feeding practices in horse welfare management and highlights anticipatory behaviour as a valuable indicator for assessing animal well-being. Such assessments, rooted in circadian rhythms, offer a less resource-intensive means for ongoing welfare monitoring in animal care settings. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To review data on the advances in equine ophthalmic imaging that have been made during the past 5 years and highlight advantages of using multiple imaging modalities to improve clinical observational skills and improve diagnostic accuracy. METHODS A literature review from 2019 through 2024 of equine ophthalmic digital photography, fundus photography, ocular and orbital ultrasonography (US), ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), confocal microscopy (CM), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), radiography, CT, and MRI. RESULTS Digital photography remains the cornerstone of equine ophthalmic imaging for documenting examination findings, sharing information with colleagues, and consulting with specialists. Digital images also allow for in-depth postexamination review and evaluation, often revealing subtleties that may have otherwise gone undetected during the ophthalmic examination. Advanced imaging modalities are being used more frequently in equine ophthalmology, especially those that can be used with the horses standing under sedation, including US, UBM, SD-OCT, CM, and CT. DISCUSSION Advances in equine ophthalmic imaging have led to many new clinical discoveries and to an increase in our knowledge of ocular anatomy and diseases in the horse. Many of these advanced diagnostic imaging modalities, such as MRI, CT, SD-OCT, and CM, are cost prohibitive and require substantial operator training to ensure proficiency. However, their availability in tertiary referral centers, such as veterinary teaching hospitals and large equine clinics/ practices, is becoming more widespread. CONCLUSIONS Advanced equine ophthalmic imaging data contributes substantially to our general understanding of clinical and applied anatomy and improves our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis associated with specific diseases. ©The authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: To date, there are no studies on the impact of two distinct environments—one familiar to the horse and another unfamiliar—on intraocular pressure (IOP) and tear production. Objectives: To compare the measured IOP and tear production values in horses between a horse stable and a medical barn. Study design: Cross-over. Methods: Thirty healthy male Arabian horses, aged 6.88 ± 3.34 years were used. IOP and tear production measurements were assessed in both the horse stable and the medical barn, with a paired Student's t-test and Bland–Altman analysis conducted for comparison and agreement, respectively. Results: A significant increase in IOP was observed in the medical barn (34.2 ± 6.8 mmHg) compared with the horse stable (29.5 ± 7.2 mmHg, p = 0.02). However, no statistically significant difference in tear production was found between horse stable (22.1 ± 2.8 mm/min) and medical barn (23.6 ± 3.4 mm/min) (p = 0.09). The standard error of the slope was 0.36 for the IOP measured in the medical barn, indicating a difference of −4.7 mmHg compared with the IOP measured in the horse stable (p = 0.02). The bias was fitted to y = −7.9350 + 0.1003x. The standard error of the slope was 0.39 for the tear production measured in the medical barn, indicating a difference of −1.5 mm/min compared with the tear production measured in the horse stable (p = 0.09). The bias was fitted to y = 6.1530 + −0.3367x. Main limitations: The absence of horses with ocular disorders and an assessment of the potential impact of transportation. Conclusions: A notable increase in IOP was observed in the medical barn compared with the horse stable, while tear production exhibited no significant variance between the two environments. The Bland–Altman analysis highlighted a discrepancy in IOP measurements in the horse stable, emphasising the potential influence of the environment on ocular parameters in horses. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Aims: To determine whether evidence for infection with Theileria orientalis (Ikeda) could be identified in samples of commercial red deer (Cervus elaphus), horses, and working farm dogs in New Zealand. Methods: Blood samples were collected during October and November 2019 from a convenience sample of red deer (n = 57) at slaughter. Equine blood samples (n = 50) were convenience-sampled from those submitted to a veterinary pathology laboratory for routine testing in January 2020. Blood samples, collected for a previous study from a convenience sample of Huntaway dogs (n = 115) from rural regions throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand between August 2018 and December 2020, were also tested. DNA was extracted and quantitative PCR was used to detect the T. orientalis Ikeda major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene. A standard curve of five serial 10-fold dilutions of a plasmid carrying a fragment of the T. orientalis MPSP gene was used to quantify the number of T. orientalis organisms in the samples. MPSP amplicons obtained by end-point PCR on positive samples were isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing. The resulting sequences were compared to previously published T. orientalis sequences. Results: There were 6/57 (10%) samples positive for T. orientalis Ikeda from the deer and no samples positive for T. orientalis Ikeda from the working dogs or horses. The mean infection intensity for the six PCR-positive deer was 5.1 (min 2.2, max 12.4) T. orientalis Ikeda organisms/µL. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Red deer can potentially sustain low infection intensities of T. orientalis Ikeda and could act as reservoirs of infected ticks. Further studies are needed to determine whether naïve ticks feeding on infected red deer can themselves become infected. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Macrotyloma uniflorum is known for being a rich source of protein, fat, fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins, and micronutrients. Since ancient times, it has been used as a pulse and traditional remedy in the Himalayan Mountains for curing kidney and bladder stones, bronchitis, asthma, piles, leukoderma, and heart diseases. Horse gram contains bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins, which contribute to its health advantages. These bioactive compounds demonstrated antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, and neuroprotective effects. These horse gram products are now considered superfoods and are widely utilized in worldwide cuisines. Horse gram and its crude extracts or fractions have been shown to exhibit a wide range of in vivo and in vitro pharmacological and nutraceutical properties. However, there is currently a scarcity of structure-activity investigations of isolated compounds and mechanistic research on this species. This review demonstrates that horse gram, despite its traditional usage by diverse cultures, has a profusion of bioactive chemicals with a wide range of biological effects that might be employed as biopharmaceuticals and adopted by nutraceutical industries. This study focuses on the thorough phytochemistry, folk medicinal applications, and pharmacological properties of this versatile legume plant. Furthermore, we discussed the value of plants as a source of functional foods and nutraceuticals. © 2024 Institute of Food Technologists.

ABSTRACT: Background: Radiological findings in the proximal sesamoid bones (sesamoids) are a persistent source of controversy at Thoroughbred sales, due to inconsistent classification and conflicting assignment of potential clinical importance. Objectives: To define the prevalence of sesamoid findings on sales repository radiographs in yearling and 2-year-old Thoroughbreds and to analyse associations with racing performance. To track the changes in sesamoid findings between 1 and 2 years of age in horses that present for sale at both ages. Study design: Prospective cohort study using an enrolled sample. Methods: Horses were enrolled from a 2016 yearling sale and five 2017 2-year-old sales with consignor permission. Radiological findings relating to sesamoid vascular channel appearance, abaxial contour changes and sesamoid fragments were examined. Associations between sesamoid findings and racing performance from 2 to 4 years of age were examined using multivariate regression analyses. Clinical follow-up was sought to ascertain why horses that did not race never started. Results: A total of 2508 yearlings and 436 2-year-olds were included for evaluation. Interobserver agreement using the new grading system was substantial. Yearling findings associated with a significantly reduced probability of starting a race were: Grade 3 vascular channels in forelimb sesamoids (0.52, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37–0.67), abaxial new bone in forelimb sesamoids (0.62, P = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.49–0.73), apical or abaxial fragments in forelimb sesamoids (0.55, P = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.37–0.72). For affected horses that did race, Grade 3 vascular channels in forelimb sesamoids were associated with fewer race starts (9.9 starts, P = 0.03, 95% CI: 8.0–12.2) and Grade 3 vascular channels in hindlimb sesamoids were associated with a delayed start to racing careers (54 days, P = 0.01, 95% CI: 20–89). Abaxial new bone in forelimb sesamoids was associated with a 54% reduction in total earnings (P = 0.003, 95% CI: 24–72) and a 46% reduction in earnings per start (P = 0.002, 95% CI: 21–64). Abaxial concavity occurred predominantly in yearling medial forelimb sesamoids, had no impact on racing performance and mostly resolved by 2-year-old sale. Main limitations: These findings are applicable to horses presented for sale at public auction and may underestimate the prevalence of severe lesions in non-sales horses. Conclusions: Grade 3 vascular channels, forelimb sesamoid abaxial new bone and forelimb sesamoid fragments are important findings in sales repository radiology. The new grading scale assigns a numerical grade for vascular channel appearance that matches the number of enlarged vascular channels evident in a given sesamoid. Abaxial contour changes, when present in sesamoids that are Grade 0 for enlarged vascular channels, are noted separately as either abaxial new bone or abaxial concavity. Fragments are also noted and interpreted separately. © 2024 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Maxillary nerve blocks (MNBs) commonly facilitate dental surgeries in standing horses. The goal of this prospective, blinded, cross-over design trial including 15 client-owned horses was to evaluate 3 methods of sensory function testing for confirming a successful MNB. Testing was performed bilaterally before sedation, 5 min after sedation, and 15 and 30 min after MNB with 0.5% bupivacaine and involved a needle prick dorsal to each naris, hemostat clamping of each nostril, and gingival algometry (measuring sensitivity to pain). Responses to stimulation were numerically scored and scores were summed up to a total score. Total score increases on the blocked side by ≥ 2 between baseline and 30 min Post MNB recordings signified a successful MNB. Sedation in the preceding 6 h, presence of sino-nasal disease, side of dental pathology, age, butorphanol administration, and detomidine dosing (µg/kg/min) throughout the tooth extraction procedure were recorded. In 73% of horses, MNB was successful. Sedation in the preceding 6 h (P =.732), age (P =.936), side of pathology (P =.516), and sino-nasal disease (P =.769) were not associated with total scores. Detomidine dosage and butorphanol use did not differ between horses in which the MNB was considered successful and for those in which it was not (P =.967 and P =.538, respectively). Scores obtained with gingival algometry were less closely associated with total scores (rho =.649) than those obtained with needle prick and nostril clamping (rho =.819 and.892, respectively). Therefore, needle prick and nostril clamping are considered the more reliable methods for use in clinical practice to determine the success of an MNB. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The passive stay apparatus works by blocking flexion of the knee and tarsus joints in the horse, preventing muscle fatigue. During ambulation, if this mechanism fails to release, the animal will present upward fixation of the patella, which in severe cases, can only be treated by medial patellar desmotomy (MPD). The objective of this study was to investigate the possible electromyographic and behavioral changes, after the impairment of the passive stay apparatus, in horses who have undergone MPD surgery. Five horses presenting dorsal fixation of the patella underwent electromyographic measurements at preoperatively and immediately postoperatively, 24 h, seven, 14 and 21 days after surgery. The samples were collected on a computerized surface electromyograph designed in accordance with the standards of international society of electrophysiology and kinesiology (ISEK). To capture the signals, electrodes positioned on the tensor fasciae lata, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscles were used, bilaterally. These muscles were chosen due to their participation in the passive stay apparatus. The electromyographic signals were collected and processed using a software calibrated to collect data with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz per channel. The collections took place over 60 min periods, and the results were obtained from the root means square (RMS) analysis. It was noted that the preoperative average of rest in tripedal support was 62%. On the other hand, change in weight bearing member and rest in three limbs in the postoperative period did not occur. This inability to maintain tripedal support in the postoperative period prevents the horse from resting while standing. Furthermore, there was a gradual increase in the need for post-surgical muscle recruitment, resulting in long periods of decubitus due to muscle fatigue, which is less than ideal for such large animals. Therefore, it was concluded that the animals submitted to medial patellar desmotomy, in this study, presented an inability to maintain tripedal support, in addition to a greater need for recruitment of muscle fibers, evidenced by the gradual increase in the electromyographic tracing and total RMS value of the muscles evaluated. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: In this manuscript, attentive dual residual generative adversarial network optimized using wild horse optimization algorithm for brain tumor detection (ADRGAN-WHOA-BTD) is proposed. Here, the input imageries are gathered using BraTS, RemBRANDT, and Figshare datasets. Initially, the images are preprocessed to increase the quality of images and eliminate the unwanted noises. The preprocessing is performed with dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). The image features like geodesic data and texture features like contrasts, energy, correlations, homogeneity, and entropy are extracted using multilayer dense net methods. Then, the extracted images are given to attentive dual residual generative adversarial network (ADRGAN) classifier for classifying the brain imageries. The ADRGAN weight parameters are tuned based on wild horse optimization algorithm (WHOA). The proposed method is executed in MATLAB. For the BraTS dataset, the ADRGAN-WHOA-BTD method achieved accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, precision, and error rates of 99.85%, 99.82%, 98.92%, 99.76%, 99.45%, and 0.15%, respectively. Then, the proposed technique demonstrated a runtime of 13 s, significantly outperforming existing methods. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: To support the decision-making process for the surgical intervention in equine patients suffering from intestinal colic, the present clinical study was conducted on ten horses (5 males and 5 females) aged 3 months to 8 years. An exploratory celiotomy was performed on patients with moderate to severe persistent abdominal pain, a lack of response to treatment, and the absence of intestinal borborygmi. Preoperative physical assessment (heart rate, respiration rate, mucus membrane perfusion, capillary refill time), haemato-biochemical analysis, and peritoneal fluid analysis helped in reaching a decision for surgical intervention as diagnostic indicators. Pre- and post-operative ultrasonography was also performed on the patients. Blood lactate level was significantly higher in non-survivors (9.94 mmol/L) than in survivors (4.32 mmol/L). In survivors, peritoneal fluid showed an increase in degenerative neutrophils, and total protein, and there was a decrease in lactate level post-operatively. Presence of small colon fecolith (n=4) was determined to be the primary cause of colic, followed by pelvic flexure impaction (n=2), caecum impaction (n=1) and right dorsal displacement of large colon (RDDLC) (n=1). Strangulating lesions such as small intestinal volvulus (n=2) was also recorded. The most common post-operative complication was sub-cutaneous seroma (n=2) which subsided on its own in a week or so. Surgical interventions helped to save the lives of 50% of the patients who were successfully discharged from the hospital; remarkably, all of them survived and returned to their normal functionality, as observed in the long-term follow-up. © 2024 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

ABSTRACT: Background: Few case reports describe equine coxofemoral joint osteoarthritis (CFJOA). Objectives: To evaluate diagnostic findings and outcome of horses with CFJOA and to provide a score facilitating radiographic assessment. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic, radiographic and intra-articular anaesthesia findings, treatments, outcome, and necropsy results of horses with CFJOA presented between 2002 and 2023 were collated. Radiographic findings were categorised to develop a radiographic score which was applied by two masked examiners. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was determined using weighted Cohen's kappa (Cκ) and the correlation between radiographic and ultrasound findings via Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: The study included 24 horses (median age 14 years). Most of them (20/24) were chronically lame. Frequent clinical signs included unilateral gluteal muscle atrophy (18/21), lengthening of the stride of the affected limb (13/19) and locomotion on three tracks (13/20). Both imaging modalities enabled evaluation of periarticular osteophytes (correlation coefficient r = 0.64; p = 0.003). Additionally, radiography allowed detection of irregular joint spaces, subchondral bone opacity changes and femoral head flattening/tapering. Inter-observer (Cκ = 0.846) and intra-observer (Cκ = 0.853 and Cκ = 0.842) agreement was excellent. If treated, mostly intra-articular corticosteroids were administered (16/18). Nine horses were euthanised immediately or during follow-up examination. Post-mortem, the Ligamentum capitis ossis femoris was commonly found ruptured. All surviving horses remained lame. Main limitations: Retrospective analysis of clinical records and subjective outcome assessment based on owner follow-up with potential recall bias. Due to overall disease severity, associations between different grades of clinical findings, radiographic abnormalities and outcome could not be evaluated. Conclusions: Typical clinical signs may indicate CFJOA. Standardised evaluation of ventrodorsal radiographs allows a comprehensive diagnosis. Postmortem findings suggest joint instability as a possible causative factor that may contribute to the poor prognosis and resistance to medical therapy of the disorder. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase (HLADH) is an extensively studied enzyme isolated from equine liver tissue, and holds a central role in numerous enzymatic processes, underscoring the need for thorough investigation. This study delves into the kinetic behavior and structural dynamics of HLADH, shedding light on complex mechanisms governing its catalytic activity and interactions with the cofactor. Notably, deviations from traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics are observed, manifesting as a slowdown in catalytic rate under high NADH concentrations. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, an allosteric site is identified, clarifying how excessive cofactor levels impact protein dynamics and catalytic properties. Structural alterations induced by inhibitory NADH concentrations are revealed, indicating reduced protein flexibility and modifications in catalytic cavity size, thereby elucidating the inhibitory mechanism at high cofactor concentrations. This comprehensive investigation unveils intricate facets of HLADH's catalytic mechanisms, providing a platform for further exploration in enzymology and biocatalysis. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Synovitis is present before and during osteoarthritis in horses and can result in performance-limiting lameness. Twenty-four horses with lameness localized to the metacarpo-/metatarsophalangeal joint or a single joint of the carpus were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the response of intra-articular injection with 10 million activated (aMSC) or non-activated (naMSC) allogeneic equine umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Subjective and objective lameness was assessed on Days 0, 1, 21, and 42. The treatment injection was randomly assigned and performed following the baseline assessment on Day 0. naMSC-treated horses had straight-line lameness scores that were significantly lower on Day 21 (1.0 ± 1.15) and Day 42 (1.13 ± 1.00) than on Day 0 (p = 0.0098 and p = 0.0418, respectively). aMSC-treated horses had straight-line lameness scores that were significantly lower on Day 21 (0.96 ± 1.03) and Day 42 (0.79 ± 1.05) than on Day 0 (p = 0.0011 and p < 0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for any parameter at any timepoint. In conclusion, both aMSC and naMSC allogeneic MSCs resulted in significantly improved subjective lameness scores in horses when compared to baseline lameness scores. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The diagnostic value of plain radiography for diagnosing synovial penetration in limb wounds near synovial structures has not been determined. Objectives: To assess diagnostic accuracy of plain radiography to identify synovial penetration in horses with traumatic limb wounds. Study design: Retrospective case study. Methods: Case records of horses presented to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Ghent University (2011–2021) with limb wounds near synovial structures were categorised in groups with and without synovial penetration using results of synovial fluid analysis and surgical findings. Plain radiographic images were evaluated retrospectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for the total study sample and for the cases with and without use of a metallic probe in the wound during radiographic evaluation. Results: Based on the total sample of 141 horses with synovial penetration and 75 cases without synovial involvement, plain radiography presented a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI: 52%–69%), a specificity of 81% (95% CI: 70%–89%), a PPV of 86% (95% CI: 79%–90%) and a NPV of 53% (95% CI: 46%–58%). With the use of a metallic probe, a sensitivity of 54% (95% Cl: 39%–69%), a specificity of 88% (95% Cl: 64%–99%), a PPV of 93% (95% Cl: 78%–98%) and a NPV of 41% (95% Cl: 32%–49%) were obtained. Main limitations: Sample size did not allow comparing different synovial structures. Results can be influenced by individual case characteristics. Conclusions: If findings of a series of plain radiographs suggest synovial penetration in horses with a wound near a synovial cavity, then synovial penetration is likely, but the absence of plain radiographic findings does not rule out synovial penetration. The use of a metallic probe during radiography may be helpful. However, plain radiography should be interpreted cautiously, and clinical decision making should also include other techniques. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horse owners play a critical role in mitigating the risk of pathogen spread between horses. However, little is known about how they view biosecurity and whether they experience barriers to the uptake of preventive measures. Objectives: To explore horse owners' attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of biosecurity and identify how these factors shape horse owners' decisions for biosecurity implementation. Study design: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 23 horse owners across Great Britain. Participants were purposively selected to include those in different geographic regions, with different management arrangements, and varied length of horse ownership experience. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a critical realist thematic analysis. Results: Participants felt a moral obligation to prioritise their horse's happiness, which became a challenge when certain biosecurity measures (e.g., quarantine) were perceived as compromising their horse's happiness or comfort (Theme 1). A lack of biosecurity was the social norm among shared yards and competition venues (Theme 2), which made it difficult for participants to implement biosecurity measures effectively on their own. Combined with the sense of moral obligation participants felt towards their horse, this meant that participants had to ‘care double’ (i.e., be more vigilant than they would otherwise) to compensate for collective inaction (Theme 3). Main limitations: Participants may have been more interested in and/or knowledgeable about biosecurity than the general horse owning population. Conclusions: The findings highlight several challenges that could be addressed to improve biosecurity implementation among horse owners. Efforts to encourage improved uptake of biosecurity measures should focus on communicating how reducing the risk of disease aligns with horse care. Further research on social norms in the horse industry is needed, in addition to identifying strategies to encourage a collective adoption of biosecurity measures. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Canagliflozin (CFZ) is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor that has shown promising results as a drug for the treatment of insulin dysregulation in horses. Even though CFZ is used clinically, no pharmacokinetic data has previously been published. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of CFZ after administration of a single oral dose of 1.8 mg/kg in eight healthy Icelandic horses was examined. Additionally, the effect of treatment on glucose and insulin levels in response to a graded glucose infusion was investigated. Plasma samples for CFZ quantification were taken at 0, 0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.33, 2.66, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, and 48 h post administration. CFZ was quantified using UHPLC coupled to tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A non-compartmental analysis revealed key pharmacokinetic parameters, including a median Tmax of 7 h, a Cmax of 2350 ng/mL, and a t1/2Z of 28.5 h. CFZ treatment reduced glucose (AUCGLU, p = 0.001) and insulin (AUCINS, p = 0.04) response to a graded glucose infusion administered 5 h after treatment. This indicates a rapid onset of action following a single dose in healthy Icelandic horses. No obvious adverse effects related to the treatment were observed. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In Serbia, at present, there is very little information about the welfare of horses. The aim of this study was to identify the main welfare issues likely to be encountered in five different categories of horses (Western riding horses, riding school horses, leisure horses, jumping horses, and endurance horses) kept in stabled housing systems. A total of 50 horses were evaluated using the Animal Welfare Indicator (AWIN) welfare assessment protocol for horses. Identified welfare issues in horses were inadequate box dimensions (52%, 26/50), insufficient quantity of bedding material (34%, 17/50), dirty bedding material (52%, 26/50), integument alterations (68%, 34/50), lameness (16%, 8/50), stereotypic behaviors (28%, 14/50), and negative response to human presence (24%, 12/50). The mean scores for alopecia, skin lesions, hardened spots at the mouth corners, horse grimace scale, and human-animal relationship tests in riding school horses were significantly higher (P<0.05; P<0.001) than for other categories of horses. The leisure horses exercised significantly less often (P<0.001) compared with other categories of horses. Additionally, important risks to welfare, identified across all groups of horses, were insufficient social interaction where 14 horses (28%) were unable to have any visual or physical contact with other horses. The results of this study provide the first analysis and valuable insight into the impact of the individual stable housing system on the welfare of different categories of horses in the Balkan region. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: A markerless artificial intelligence (AI) system for lameness detection has recently become available but has not been extensively compared with commonly used inertial measurement unit (IMU) systems for detecting asymmetry under field conditions. Objective: Comparison of classification of asymmetric limbs under field conditions and comparison of normalised asymmetry data using a markerless AI system (SleipAI; recorded on a tripod mounted iPhone 14pro [SL]); the Equinosis Q Lameness Locator (LL); the EquiMoves (EM); and subjective evaluation (SE). Study design: Descriptive clinical study. Methods: Straight line trot data were collected from 52 client-owned horses in regular training. Limbs were categorised as symmetric or asymmetric. Number of analysed strides were compared with Wilcoxon's each pairs test. Inter-rater reliability in classification of asymmetric limbs was assessed with Light's Kappa. Bland Altman analysis of normalised asymmetry data was performed. Results: Data from 41 horses were included. Most horses showed mild asymmetry. The EM analysed significantly more strides than the other systems, both for forelimbs and for hindlimbs (53 ± 11 strides for both, respectively; p < 0.006). The LL analysed significantly more hindlimbs strides (45 ± 13) than the SL (27 ± 6; p < 0.001). Moderate inter-rater agreement for asymmetry classification was found between systems (k = 0.59 forelimbs; 0.44 hindlimbs); agreement decreased when including the SE. For the normalised asymmetry data, the strongest agreement was found between the two IMU systems. Main limitations: Horses were assessed during straight-line trot only. Conclusions: The objective systems were comparable in classification of asymmetric limbs under field conditions when using defined asymmetry thresholds. Discrepancies stemmed largely from the imposed thresholds (i.e., systems largely identified same-side asymmetry). Overall, the strongest agreement was found between LL and EM. The SL analysed significantly fewer hindlimb strides than the LL and EM which could represent a limitation of the Sleip AI. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Radiofrequency ablation has been successfully applied to treat right atrial arrhythmias in horses. Ablation of left-sided arrhythmias requires a retrograde transarterial approach which is complicated. In human medicine, the left atrium is accessed through transseptal puncture (TSP) of the fossa ovalis (FO) using a caudal approach via the femoral vein. Objectives: To develop a zero fluoroscopy TSP technique for horses using a jugular vein (cranial) and transhepatic (caudal) approach. Study design: In vivo experimental study. Methods: Transseptal puncture was performed in 18 horses admitted for euthanasia and donated for scientific research under general anaesthesia: using a jugular vein approach (10 horses), a transhepatic approach (2 horses) or both (6 horses). Radiofrequency energy was applied on a guidewire to perforate the FO and allow sheath advancement under intracardiac and transthoracic echocardiographic guidance. Puncture lesions were inspected post-mortem. Results: Transseptal puncture was successful in 17/18 horses, of which 15/16 jugular vein approaches and 5/8 transhepatic approaches. Failure was due to technical malfunction, inability to advance the guidewire toward the heart and inability to advance the sheath through the FO. Intracardiac echocardiography was essential to safely guide the puncture process. Atrial arrhythmias caused by the TSP occurred in 13/18 horses. Puncture lesions were found in the right atrium in the FO region, and left atrium ventral to pulmonary vein ostium III. Main limitations: Because in several horses two approaches were tested consecutively, it cannot be excluded that the second TSP was performed at the previous puncture site. Due to the developmental nature of the study the approaches were not randomised and did not allow comparison. Conclusion: Transseptal puncture is feasible in horses using ultrasound guidance and allows for electrophysiological exploration of the left heart. Further studies are needed to evaluate post-operative follow-up. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Horseflies are pests that cause discomfort from blood-sucking and disease transmission, and economic losses in the equine industry. This study evaluated the efficacy of horsecloth impregnated with icaridin in reducing horsefly attacks and deterring horseflies. Repellent activities were evaluated under three conditions: treatment 1 (no horsecloth), 2 (horsecloth without icaridin), and 3 (horsecloth impregnated with icaridin), using three native Hokkaido horses (Dosanko) and three mixed-breed horses (Dosanko and Haflinger) in July 2023 at a riding horse club in Hokkaido, Japan. Treatment 3 significantly reduced the number of horseflies. Treatment 2 did not significantly reduce horsefly numbers. Treatments 2 and 3 significantly reduced the number of avoidance actions. The reduction in avoidance actions in treatment 3 was greater than that in treatment 2. Lighter-colored horses experienced fewer fly attacks and avoidance actions than darker-colored horses. Overall, using icaridin-impregnated horsecloths (treatment 3) was more effective for repelling horseflies than the use of physical barriers alone (treatment 2). This study suggests that integrating chemical repellents with physical protection can enhance horsefly control strategies, improve horse welfare, and improve the safety of horses interacting with them. Further research is recommended to assess the generalizability of these findings to different horse breeds and environments with a greater number of horses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Registration numbers for the Palomino Horse Breeders of America (PHBA) have risen with the assistance of new registration guidelines. These changes in guidelines allowed for registration of any horse with a palomino body color, including those with unknown pedigrees. While this promoted registry growth, documenting the breed's orgins from those known pedigrees making up the breed's foundation is important with the introduction of unknown pedigrees. This can be accomplished using pedigree tracing, which is of particular value for color registries as the study of coat color patterns is plagued with misunderstandings due to pedigrees with inaccurate color designations. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the historical origins of the modern PHBA stock-type horse through pedigree tracing. Horses (n = 460) were randomly sampled from published entries from 10 years (2012-2022) of the PHBA World Show Championship Horse Show. The All-Breed Database was utilized to obtain documentation of extended pedigrees that included uninterrupted generation-to-generation inheritance patterns of a cream dilution allele-influenced coat color. Pedigrees were traced back to the earliest recorded relative. We observed six foundation sires contributed to the modern PHBA stock-type horse with the majority (58%) tracing back to a sire named Old Fred. Two identified sires, Yellow Jacket (4%) and Cotton Eyed Joe (3%), have conflicts concerning color designation. While these results assist in documenting the breed's origins, genetic testing is required to accurately identify the cream dilution allele within the horses registered to ensure a phenotype-based solely on the cream dilution allele. © 2024

ABSTRACT: INFLAMMATORY airway disease (IAD) represents inflammatory conditions of the lower respiratory tract. IAD occurs in athletic horses and is a common cause of training interruption and impaired performance. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene and cytokines in horses with chronic IAD. Ten horses with IAD and five clinically healthy horses were studied. Serum levels of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured, and real-time PCR was used for relative quantification of the mRNA level of the VDR gene in horse blood samples. Clinically, horses under investigation suffered from IAD showing mucopurulent nasal discharge, increased respiratory rate, chronic cough, and abnormal lung and tracheal sounds. A significant increase in IL-1β (p < 0.01) and TNF (p < 0.01) levels was recorded in horses with chronic IAD compared to those in clinically healthy horses. However, VDR gene expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in horses with chronic inflammatory airway disease compared to that in the controls. There was a positive correlation between IL-1β and TNF-α levels (r =, p = 0.001). However, a negative correlation was observed between VDR gene expression and IL-1β and TNF-α levels. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that VDR gene has a major role in the occurrence of IAD in horses. Further studies on the role of vitamin D as a preventive therapy for IAD are required in clinical practice. ©2025 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

ABSTRACT: Background: Injuries of the sagittal groove of the proximal phalanx (P1) in equine athletes are considered to predominantly occur due to chronic bone stress overload. Objectives: To describe the range of abnormalities that is present in the sagittal groove in a large group of horses diagnosed with sagittal groove disease (SGD) on low-field MRI. Study Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional. Methods: Medical records were searched to identify initial MRI images of horses diagnosed with SGD and these were blindly evaluated using a semi-quantitative grading scheme and novel SGD MRI classification system reflecting potential pathways of pathological progression and severity of stress injury. Results: A total of 132 limbs from 111 horses were included in the study; predominantly warmbloods competing in showjumping (n = 83) and dressage (n = 18). SGD MRI classifications were: 0 (normal, n = 0), 1 (small subchondral defect, n = 2), 2 (osseous densification, n = 28), 3 (subchondral microfissure with osseous densification, n = 7), 4 (bone oedema-like signal within the subchondral ± trabecular bone and ± subchondral microfissure or demineralisation, n = 72), 5 (incomplete macrofissure/fracture, n = 23) and 6 (complete fracture, n = 0). Classification 4c (bone oedema-like signal with demineralisation) and 5 had higher proportions in the plantar third of hindlimbs (3% and 10%, respectively) compared with forelimbs (0% and 0%, respectively). SGD classification and extent of bone oedema-like signal were not significantly different between lame (n = 116) and non-lame limbs (n = 16) (both p > 0.05). Periosteal new bone and oedema-like signal were identified (either confidently or suspected) at the dorsoproximal aspect of P1 in 25% and 39% of limbs, respectively. Main Limitations: Inclusion via diagnoses in original MRI reports, variable clinical history, small size of some classification groups. Conclusions: The presence or absence of lameness is not a dependable measure of the severity of SGD. The periosteal oedema-like signal of P1 has not previously been described in MRI of SGD and further supports the concept of bone stress injury. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Individual livestock identification is of great importance to precision livestock farming. Liquid nitrogen freezing labeled horse brand is an effective way for livestock individual identification. Along with various technological developments, deep-learning-based methods have been applied in such individual marking recognition. In this research, a deep learning method for oriented horse brand location and recognition was proposed. Firstly, Rotational YOLOv5 (R-YOLOv5) was adopted to locate the oriented horse brand, then the cropped images of the brand area were trained by YOLOv5 for number recognition. In the first step, unlike classical detection methods, R-YOLOv5 introduced the orientation into the YOLO framework by integrating Circle Smooth Label (CSL). Besides, Coordinate Attention (CA) was added to raise the attention to positional information in the network. These improvements enhanced the accuracy of detecting oriented brands. In the second step, number recognition was considered as a target detection task because of the requirement of accurate recognition. Finally, the whole brand number was obtained according to the sequences of each detection box position. The experiment results showed that R-YOLOv5 outperformed other rotating target detection algorithms, and the AP (Average Accuracy) was 95.6 %, the FLOPs were 17.4 G, the detection speed was 14.3 fps. As for the results of number recognition, the mAP (mean Average Accuracy) was 95.77 %, the weight size was 13.71 MB, and the detection speed was 68.6 fps. The two-step method can accurately identify brand numbers with complex backgrounds. It also provides a stable and lightweight method for livestock individual identification. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Strongylid nematodes represent a major health and performance concern for equids globally. However, the epidemiology of strongylid infections in horse populations remains largely unexplored in Thailand. This study investigated the prevalence of strongylid parasites and the associated risk factors in domesticated horses in Thailand. Additionally, the study utilized ITS-2 rDNA metabarcoding to characterize the diversity and co-occurrence patterns of strongylid species. Of the 408 horses examined, 50.98% tested positive for strongyle infection, with an average intensity of 445.67 ± 639.58 eggs. Notably, only 25.74% exhibited fecal egg counts of ≥ 200 eggs per gram (EPG), highlighting the need for targeted deworming protocols. Significantly higher EPG values were observed in yearling horses (p = 0.001) and those kept in outdoor pastures (p = 0.0001). Metabarcoding identified 15 strongylid species, with Cylicostephanus longibursatus being the most abundant (mean relative abundance: 37.30%, SD = 31.16%). No Strongylus species were detected. Alpha diversity analysis revealed no significant differences in species richness and evenness across horse groups, while beta diversity analysis showed significant dissimilarities (p = 0.004), primarily driven by Cylicostephanus longibursatus, Cyathostomum pateratum, and Cylicostephanus calicatus, which contributed to over 60% of the variation. Species co-occurrence patterns were largely random, with a limited number of positive (n = 5) and negative (n = 2) species pair associations. These findings provide essential insights into the current state of strongylid infections in Thai horses and offer a foundation for future research and management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Horses may exhibit evasive and flight behaviors to novel situations. These reactive behaviors threaten the safety of horses, owners, handlers, and riders. Poor handling of these reactions also negatively impacts the animal's behavior and, consequently, its well-being. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a counterconditioning technique to reduce fear responses in horses through a brief exposure procedure. It was conducted with 20 naive horses (16 females and 4 males) of Quarter Horse and Chilean Creole breeds. A pre-post design with experimental and control groups was used. Two training sessions of seven minutes each were conducted, applying counterconditioning in the experimental group and measuring Partial and Total Exposure responses to the fear-inducing situation, Resistance to Handling, Exploratory Behavior Towards Frightening Situation, Exploratory Behavior Towards Handler, and Heart Rate. Mixed ANOVAs were used to analyze the effects of counterconditioning on each dependent variable. The experimental group showed significantly lower resistance to handling compared to the control group (F(1,18) = 5.89, p = 0.02), with a reduction in fear-related reactions (mean decrease of 20 %, SD = 5.6). Additionally, exploratory behavior towards the handler increased significantly in the experimental group (F(1,18) = 6.34, p = 0.019), suggesting a shift in focus from the fear-inducing stimulus to the handler. Heart rate differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). These results suggest that counterconditioning can reduce resistance and promote positive human-animal interactions during exposure to fear-inducing stimuli. These findings show that counterconditioning operates as an active technique, manifesting effects exclusively when implemented. It also serves as an effective strategy for enhancing a horse's exposure to novel or fear-inducing situations. The change in behavioral reaction can be attributed to a process of re-evaluative learning, in which horses shift their focus towards the positive stimuli provided by humans, reducing the prior negative association with fear-inducing situations. Reducing resistance behaviors and guiding the horse's attention toward the favorable aspects of human interaction holds significant importance for ensuring safe exposure and reinforcing the bond between humans and animals. An alternative approach explores appetitive stimulation as a reinforcer for coping, exposure, and collaborative behavior, influencing motivation and bonding. Ultimately, preliminary findings suggest that the appetitive technique positively impacts proximity to humans, indicating the potential for a secure horse-handler relationship. Further research is needed to assess this technique's long-term effects and nuances on the human-animal bond within the context of horses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background/Objectives: The Mongolian horse, one of the oldest and most genetically diverse breeds, exhibits a wide variety of coat colors and patterns, including both wild-type and unique features. A notable characteristic of dun Mongolian horses is the presence of Bider markings—symmetrical, black-mottled patterns observed on the shoulder blades. These markings are also seen in Przewalski’s horses. The dun coat color, a common wild-type phenotype in domestic horses, is characterized by pigment dilution with distinct dark areas and is regulated by mutations in the TBX3 gene. This study aimed to investigate the role of TBX3 in the development of Bider markings in dun Mongolian horses. Methods: Skin tissue samples were collected from three key anatomical regions of dun Mongolian horses with Bider markings: the croup, dorsal midline, and shoulder. Histological staining was conducted to examine the skin and hair follicle structure and pigment distribution. RT-qPCR was used to measure TBX3 mRNA expression, while immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were employed to analyze TBX3 protein levels and localization. Results: Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the skin and hair follicle structures, including the epidermis, hair shaft, and hair bulb across different stages of the hair growth cycle. Differences in pigmentation were observed across the sampling sites. The croup and the light-colored area of the shoulder showed asymmetrical pigmentation, while the dorsal midline and dark-colored area of the shoulder displayed symmetrical pigmentation. TBX3 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the croup compared to the shoulder and dorsal midline; however, corresponding TBX3 protein expression did not show significant differences. Immunohistochemical analysis localized TBX3 protein predominantly in the hair bulb and epidermis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates region-specific differences in TBX3 expression that correlate with pigmentation patterns in dun Mongolian Bider horses. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Bider markings, offering a deeper understanding of the genetic regulation of coat color and primitive markings in equines. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The 2007 Horse NRC reduced cobalt (Co) requirements from 0.1 ppm to 0.05 ppm in dietary dry matter, though preliminary research suggested increasing dietary-Co enhanced fiber digestion in horses. This study aimed to evaluate fiber digestion with varying dietary Co amounts, as well as to compare serum Co concentrations with dietary Co content. Four geldings (mean body weight [BW] 503 ± 37 kg) were studied in a 4 × 4 Latin square design consisting of four 5-week periods, each comprising a 2-week washout phase followed by a 3-week treatment phase. Supplementing 0.0, 5.6, 16.8, or 28.0 mg of Co daily resulted in total Co dietary concentrations of 0.06, 0.7, 2.0, and 3.0 ppm, respectively. Feces and urine were collected to evaluate fiber digestibility and Co balance. Co supplementation did not affect neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, or lignin digestibility. Co balance was negative for the control diet but positive for the other three treatments (p = 0.04). Serum cobalamin concentrations slightly decreased (6%) with increasing dietary Co intake (p = 0.003), while folate concentrations were unaffected. Serum Co concentration differed (p < 0.01) with a mean of 4.7 μg/mL for the high treatment and 0.8 μg/mL for the control. Results suggest that serum Co concentrations above regulatory limits are likely due not to higher levels of Co in fortified feeds, but rather to parenteral administration of Co solutions. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression are epigenetic mechanisms essential for regulating tissue-specific gene expression and metabolic processes. However, high-resolution transcriptome, methylome, or miRNAome data is only available for a few model organisms and selected tissues. Up to date, only a few studies have reported on gene expression, DNA methylation, or miRNA expression in adult equine tissues at the genome-wide level. In the present study, we used RNA-Seq, miRNA-seq, and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from the heart, lung, and liver tissues of healthy cold-blooded horses to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially expressed miRNA (DE miRNA) and differentially methylated sites (DMSs) between three types of horse tissues. Additionally, based on integrative omics analysis, we described the observed interactions of epigenetic mechanisms with tissue-specific gene expression alterations. The obtained data allowed identification from 4067 to 6143 DMSs, 9733 to 11,263 mRNAs, and 155 to 185 microRNAs, differentially expressed between various tissues. We pointed out specific genes whose expression level displayed a negative correlation with the level of CpG methylation and miRNA expression and revealed biological processes that they enrich. Furthermore, we confirmed and validated the accuracy of the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) results with bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). This comprehensive analysis forms a strong foundation for exploring the epigenetic mechanisms involved in tissue differentiation, especially the growth and development of the equine heart, lungs, and liver. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: This is the first report describing the isolation and genome sequence of Flavobacterium ceti (F. ceti IJFC025) from a draining submandibular lymph node abscess in a 6-year-old mixed-breed mare in Korea. Since F. ceti is not a usual infectious pathogen that causes equine health problems, this study presents the complete genome sequence of F. ceti isolated from a submandibular lymph node abscess sample in Jeju, South Korea, in 2022. The entire genome sequence of F. ceti IJFC025 consisted of a 3,144,426-bp chromosome with 35.6 % G + C content. Gene prediction revealed that this strain possesses 2909 coding sequences (CDSs), 74 tRNAs, and five rRNAs. Average nucleotide identity analysis of the whole-genome sequence revealed 98.6 %–98.8 % nucleotide identity between F. ceti IJFC025 and F. ceti CECT7184, which was previously isolated from beaked whales. PathogenFinder revealed four different virulence genes in the genome that could potentially cause infections in horses. F. ceti CECT7184 contained genes encoding propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase A subunit, and the translation initiation factor IF-1, whereas F. ceti IJFC025 does not. Instead, F. ceti IJFC025 harbors genes encoding deoxyhypusine synthase, whereas F. ceti CECT7184 does not. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that F. ceti IJFC025 is a multidrug-resistant strain that is resistant to gentamicin, ceftazidime, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and colistin. However, no resistance genes were detected in the whole-genome sequence. Because of the similarity of the clinical signs with those of strangles, this pathogen needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of submandibular lymphadenopathy in horses. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: High-starch diets may affect equine hindgut microbiota and increase blood glucose levels, which may cause unwanted physiological changes, but may also elicit behavioural changes such as increased fear reactions. The purpose of the current study was to feed a high starch (300) and low fat (43; HS_LF) or a low starch (60) and high fat (85; LS_HF, g/kg of DM) concentrate within the available commercial range and investigate how muscle endurance and fear reactions of horses respond to different diets. Twenty Danish Warmblood stallions (4 years) were randomly allocated to two treatments: LS_HF (n = 10) and HS_LF (n = 10) for 9 weeks. During the two last weeks, a single step exercise test was performed, and plasma metabolites and blood gases were measured before and after exercise in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The effect of two diets on fearfulness was tested by exposing the horses to novel objects test (T1 and T2). Plasma metabolites was not affected by diets. However, plasma level of glucose post-exercise (4.9) was lower than pre-exercise (5.6 mmol/L; p < 0.001). Similarly, plasma level of insulin post-exercise (4.2) was lower than pre-exercise (13.1 pmol/L; p < 0.001). Plasma level of lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.001), non-esterified fatty acids (p = 0.002), β-hydroxybutyrate (p = 0.001), and fructosamine (p = 0.01) post-exercise was higher than pre-exercise. Regardless of type of diets, RRR-α-tocopherol was the dominance α-tocopherol stereoisomers in plasma. In conclusion, during aerobic exercise, fat to starch ratio in horse diets within the normal range had no significant effect on plasma metabolites. However, horses fed LS_HF tended to show more investigative behaviour than horses fed HS_LF. © 2024 The Author(s). Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Background: The microbial composition of Sumbawa Horse Milk is influenced by various factors, including environmental elements that encompass geographical location, climate, and conditions specific to Sumbawa. This study aimed to determine the biodiversity and genetic diversity of the microbiome of Sumbawa Horse Milk, with an emphasis on yeast. Methods: The diversity and group of yeast isolates were evaluated by the sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) method using ME2F-EM15R (1) and ME2F-EM12R (2) primers. Molecular identification using 18 S rRNA primers was then carried out on nine selected isolates (K_21, K_31, K_42, K_45, K_1, K_6, K_8, K_17, and K_19) to determine the type of yeast. Probiotic candidate tests were carried out on three isolates, namely K_1, K_6 and K_8. Results: Analysis with NTSYS software on the SRAP results using Primer 1 revealed the presence of two major groups, where Group I was exclusively comprised of K_45 isolate, whereas the other isolates belonged to Group II. On the other hand, analysis with NTSYS software on the SRAP analysis with Primer 2 also showed two major groups with different compositions. Group I consisted of isolates K_39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, and 21, while the remaining isolates belonged to Group II. Results of 18 S rRNA analysis demonstrated that K_17 and K_19 had 99.8 and 100% similarity, respectively, and identified as Candida humilis. K_21, K_31, and K_45 were identified as having a 100% similarity to Clavispora lusitaniae, while K_42 had a 99.8% similarity to Candida parapsilosis. Three isolates were identified as belonging to the genus Ogataea, namely Ogataea polymorpha (K_6 and K_8) and Ogataea siamensis (K_1) with similarity of 100% and 99.8%, respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the three yeast have potential as probiotics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to evaluate physiological variables invasively and non-invasively and heat exchange in Nordestina breed horses, and to determine which variables have the greatest discriminating power in terms of adaptive profile, using canonical and stepwise discriminant analysis. Seven adult horses were used, 3 females and 4 stallion males, which were housed from birth in the property's paddocks with ad libitum access to native pasture, concentrate in the trough and water, remaining in these conditions during the experimental period. The thermal comfort index (TCI) values ​​above 65 are considered severe heat stress for horses. The rectal temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate of the females were similar (P > 0.05) between the periods and these variables remained within the limit for the equine species, even with the rise in air temperature in the afternoon and the high TCI, demonstrating the animals' adaptive capacity. The Nordestina breed showed physiological values within the standard for the species, even with the ambient temperature above the thermal comfort zone in both periods (30.09 and 35.05 °C), being efficient at dissipating heat through the skin and respiratory system, keeping the rectal temperature within the standard for the species © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Pre-purchase examinations (PPEs) are performed for prospective purchasers of horses to identify prejudicial findings that could make animals unsuitable for an intended use. Although this examination process is often standardised, PPEs remain, in large parts, a subjective procedure. In the United Kingdom, PPEs generally consist of either a two stage (two stage vetting [2SV], i.e., general physical examination at rest and basic trot in-hand) or a five stage-examination (five stage vetting [5SV], i.e., general physical exam at rest and after exercise, lameness evaluation including strenuous exercise with re-evaluation after a period of recovery). Objectives: To identify the proportion of PPEs with prejudicial findings in a mixed horse population in the United Kingdom and to determine those findings. Study design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: PPE certificates from three first opinion equine practices were reviewed. Data collected included practice identity, examination format (i.e., 2SV or 5SV), PPE outcome, radiographs obtained (yes/no), purchase price, animal signalment, intended use and prejudicial PPE findings, if indicated. Prejudicial findings were grouped in 10 subcategories. Descriptive statistics were obtained for all parameters. Non-normally distributed numeric data between groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical data were compared between groups using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Overall, 133 pre-purchase examination certificates were analysed. Seventy-six horses (57.1%) had prejudicial findings: Sixty-one (68.5%) horses undergoing 5SV and 15 (34.1%) of horses undergoing 2SV. Most horses had lameness as the primary prejudicial finding. Horses with a higher purchase price were more likely to undergo 5SV, undergo pre-purchase radiography, and were more likely to have prejudicial findings identified. Main limitations: Data were obtained retrospectively from PPE certificates from a single mixed horse population and different results may have been obtained by analysing a larger number of animals or PPEs of horses intended for different uses, from different geographical regions or undergoing a different PPE format. The level of competition in the intended discipline for horses was not recorded. Analysed data were limited to the information recorded on the PPE certificates, and the original radiographs, ultrasonography images and other additional diagnostic data were not reviewed. Conclusions: Lameness was the most common prejudicial PPE finding. More expensive horses were more likely to undergo a 5SV, have pre-purchase radiographs obtained and have prejudicial findings identified. These results may help inform prospective studies examining the merits of 5SV versus 2SV formats and the value of inclusion of additional diagnostic imaging in PPEs in the general horse population. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of low-volume (5-mL) locoregional retrobulbar anesthesia (“retrobulbar block”) by use of 3 commercial local anesthetic formulations. ANIMALS 8 healthy adult mares. METHODS A block-randomized, masked, controlled design was used. A single ultrasound-guided retrobulbar block was performed with 2% lidocaine, 2% mepivacaine, or 0.5% bupivacaine (n = 5 eyes/group). Contralateral eyes served as untreated controls. End points performed at baseline and time intervals up to 24 hours postblock included the following: assessment of neurophthalmic reflexes/responses, intraocular pressure, and vertical pupil diameter measurement, corneal and periocular esthesiometry, and observation for adverse effects. RESULTS Low-volume block did not result in increased intraocular pressure or other adverse effects at any time point in any treatment group. Statistically significant corneal anesthesia (P < .001) was observed 1 minute after block in all groups, persisting through 4 hours after lidocaine or mepivacaine block and through 24 hours after bupivacaine block. Clinically significant periocular anesthesia was not observed in any group. Significant vertical pupil diameter increase (P < .05) was observed for up to 4 hours after lidocaine or mepivacaine block and 6 hours after bupivacaine block. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Low-volume retrobulbar block with any of the 3 local anesthetic drugs evaluated was not associated with adverse effects. In terms of efficacy, mepivacaine block showed no clinical advantage over lidocaine block. However, bupivacaine block induced comparatively rapid and sustained corneal anesthesia. In comparison to published findings using a larger injection volume, low-volume retrobulbar block with lidocaine produced clinically comparable corneal anesthesia. However, periocular soft tissue anesthesia was not achieved with any local anesthetic drug at low volume. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Keeping horses in open barns has positive effects on social interaction and free movement, which may improve horse welfare. However, many horse owners fear that housing in open barns leads to more injuries. Objective: To compare health events among horses housed in an active open barn (AOB) or in single boxes (BOX). Study design: A prospective study during 9 months and a 2-year retrospective study. Methods: Two housing systems in one farm were investigated: AOB and BOX in pairs or alone in paddock (2–4 h/day) using 66 and 69 horses in the prospective respectively retrospective study. Lameness, wounds, colic and days lost from training were recorded. Results: There were lower prevalences of lameness and colic in AOB than in BOX (18% vs. 26% and 0% vs. 5%; p < 0.001). Overall, there was a larger proportion of individuals with health events in AOB (83%) compared with BOX (52%) (p < 0.01). However, number of days lost to training did not differ between AOB (10 ± 15 days) and BOX (15 ± 34 days) (p = 0.36). There were no significant differences between the housing systems in number of health events/horse in the retrospective study: AOB 1.54 ± 1.51 versus BOX 1.14 ± 1.20 (p = 0.22). Main limitations: The different, not standardised, housing systems varied in size and number of horses with no individual consideration in this descriptive field study with no possibility to cross-over. A convenience sample was used. Conclusions: Lameness and colic were less frequent in the AOB system compared to single boxes, probably because the horses in the open barn could move freely day and night. Horses in AOB had a higher prevalence of wounds due to interactions between horses, but this did not lead to more days lost from training. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Organs of future metastasis are not passive receivers of circulating tumor cells, but are instead selectively and actively modified by the primary tumor before metastatic spread has even occurred. Tumors orchestrate a pre-metastatic program by conditioning distant organs to create microenvironments that foster the survival and proliferation of tumor cells before their arrival, thereby establishing pre-metastatic niches. Primary tumor-derived exosomes modulate these pre-metastatic niches, generating a permissive environment that facilitates the homing and expansion of tumor cells. Moreover, microRNAs have emerged as a key component of exosomal cargo, serving not only to induce the formation of pre-metastatic niches but also to prime these sites for the arrival and colonization of specific secondary tumor populations. Against this backdrop, this review endeavors to elucidate the impact of tumor-derived exosomal microRNAs on the genesis of their individualized pre-metastatic niches, with a view towards identifying novel means of specifying cancer metastasis and exploiting this phenomenon for cancer immunotherapy. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: In the gastrointestinal mucosa, there is a close cooperation between secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and the composition of the microbiota, which aims to maintain homeostasis as well as act as a protective barrier. The purpose of this study was to determine the composition of microbiota and SIgA production in different parts of the digestive tract (small intestine, cecum, colon and rectum) of nine healthy horses and its reflection in the feces. For this purpose, we determined: the composition of the microbiome (by next-generation Sequencing of Hypervariable Regions V3-V4 and V7-V9 of the 16 S rRNA gene analysis), the amount of SIgA in the intestinal content samples (by ELISA), as well as the number of IgA-producing cells (IgA+) in the tissue samples (by immohistochemical analysis). Significant differences were observed between the small intestine and the large colon in the composition and diversity of the microbiome, as well as the number of IgA + cells in the mucosal lamina propria and the abundance of SIgA in the intestinal lumen. The small intestine in relation to the large colon is characterised by fewer IgA + cells, more SIgA in the intestinal contents and a less diverse microbiome. However, the cecum appears to be the third separate ecosystem, with a high number of IgA + cells and a diverse microbiome. The fecal sample reflects the current state of the large colon, both in terms of the microbiome and SIgA content; however, it is not known to what extent it may be influenced by dysbiosis in other parts of the digestive tract. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horses must lie down to go into vital rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. If they are not lying down for sufficiently long periods they can become so sleep-deprived that they collapse uncontrollably, which results in a risk of injuries. Objectives: To investigate how recumbency as a prerequisite to REM sleep on the experimental days and the following nights was influenced by changes in social and spatial environment throughout the day. Study design: Cross-over design in which subjects experienced each experimental condition twice. Methods: Observations were conducted on a horse farm. Ten young horses in training were observed on days when they were alone indoors in a box, on an outdoor paddock alone, on the same paddock in pairs, and in the following night stabled alone. The number of lying bouts and the total lying duration throughout the day and night were assessed automatically using 3D-accelerometers and data were evaluated using mixed-models. Results: Horses had a higher number of lying bouts during the days (p = 0.05, by a factor of 1.21 [95% CI: 1.00–1.45]) and longer lying duration at night (p < 0.001, by a factor of 11.25 [6.47–18.40]). On average, the number of lying bouts and the duration of lying increased from being indoors alone, to being outdoors alone, and outdoors in pairs although this could not be statistically supported (bouts: p = 0.5, by a factor of 1.08 [0.84–1.36] and 1.17 [0.91–1.48]; p = 0.6, duration: by a factor of 1.39 [0.73–2.93] and 1.38 [0.68–2.78]). Main limitations: A small number of horses were observed and there was large variability between days within horses. Conclusions: We found some indications that open space and a social companion throughout the day increased time lying down in the day as well as during the following nights thus allowing for more REM sleep. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Different energy sources are often used in horse diets to enhance health and performance. Understanding how diet impacts the cecal and fecal microbiota is crucial for meeting the nutritional needs of horses. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR were used to compare the fecal and cecal microbiota of five healthy horses receiving three different diets: hay diet (HAY), hay + starch and sugar (SS), and hay + fiber and oil ingredients (FO). Assessment of short-chain fatty acids, pH, and buffer capacity was also performed. The HAY diet was associated with the highest values of fecal pH; the FO and SS diets were associated with higher values of BC6 in the cecum, and the SS diet had higher BC5 values in feces (p < 0.05). HAY was associated with a lower alpha diversity in feces and with a higher abundance of Treponema, Fibrobacter, Lachnospiraceae AC2044, and Prevotellaceae UCG-003 in feces. SS was associated with a higher abundance of Desulfovibrio, the Lachnospiraceae AC2044 group, and Streptococcus in the cecum, and Streptococcus and Prevotellaceae UCG-001 in feces, while FO was associated with higher Prevotella, Prevotellaceae UCG-003, and Akkermansia in the cecum, and the Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group and Ruminococcus in feces. This study indicated that different energy sources can influence cecal and fecal microbiota composition and fecal diversity without significantly affecting fermentation processes under experimental conditions. These findings suggest that the diets studied may not pose immediate health risks; however, further research is needed to generalize these effects on gastrointestinal microbiota in broader equine populations. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Digestible energy (DE) accounts for the major fraction of the energy content of hay fed to equines, but DE measurements are difficult to carry out, and researchers have developed models for predicting the DE content of hays for horses from their chemical composition. Digestible energy varies depending on botanical family, species, and agronomic and climatic conditions. A database of 61 hays harvested in a temperate zone (32 natural grassland hays, 16 grass hays and 13 lucerne hays) was set up from studies carried out at the French National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRAe) or extracted from the literature using a similar methodological corpus, to test the relevance of crude fibre (CF), NDF, ADF, total free reducing sugars (TFRS), CP as potential criteria for the prediction of organic matter digestibility (OMD), energy digestibility (ED) and digestible energy (DE). Models were developed for natural grassland hay, grass hay and lucerne hay. The adjusted cross-validation R2 values (R2CV) of the models obtained using CF, ADF or NDF as single variables or in combination with CP for the prediction of OMD, ED and DE of natural grassland hay ranged from 0.84 to 0.86, from 0.83 to 0.86 and from 0.82 to 0.84, respectively. For grass hay, the R2CV were lower and ranged from 0.65 to 0.71, from 0.63 to 0.71 and from 0.62 to 0.68, for the prediction of OMD, ED and DE, respectively. Finally, for lucerne hay, the R2CV ranged from 0.65 to 0.72, from 0.34 to 0.74 and from 0.25 to 0.67, for the prediction of OMD, ED and DE, respectively. The R2CV of the prediction models of ED and DE were more heterogeneous for lucerne hay than for grassland and grass hay. The TFRS content of hay was never a significant predictive variable of OMD, ED or DE, either as single variable or combined with any cell wall content criterion. The models obtained in the present study improved those proposed by INRA to date. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: Theileria haneyi is one of the three known causative agents of equine piroplasmosis. While imidocarb is generally effective in the clearance of the highly pathogenic Theileria equi, it is ineffective in the treatment of T. haneyi. Moreover, co-infection with T. haneyi has been shown to impede the successful treatment of T. equi. Furthermore, tulathromycin and diclazuril have demonstrated inefficacy in eradicating T. haneyi. The absence of an effective therapeutic agent against this parasite represents a significant obstacle in managing equine piroplasmosis. Methods: To address this issue, we evaluated the efficacy of buparvaquone in the treatment of T. haneyi in chronically infected horses. Results: Our findings showed that treatment of horses with the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg of buparvaquone led to a rapid abatement of T. haneyi levels, to a level where the parasites were not detectable by nested PCR. Following treatment, the horses remained PCR negative for a minimum of seven weeks until recrudescence occurred. Subsequent re-administration of buparvaquone at an increased dosage of 6 mg/kg upon recrudescence failed to exert a theilericidal effect on T. haneyi. Throughout the treatment regimen, the hematological parameters of the horses and most components of the chemistry panel remained within the normal range, except for blood urea nitrogen levels, which fell below the normal range in certain instances. conclusions: BPQ at 2.5 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg had a robust theilericidal effect but was ineffective in the clearance of the T. haneyi infection in persistently infected animals.

ABSTRACT: Re-introduction of captive endangering or extinct animals to their native habitats holds profound ecological significance. But evaluating the feralization progress of re-introduced “wild” animals requires concise and quantitative indicator(s) to integrate traditional assessments on self-sustainability and reproduction. A fecal ARGs’ profiling was conducted for Przewalski's horses, an extinct flagship herbivore, in Xinjiang, China from the Breeding Center (captive), Tianshan Wildlife Zoo (semi-captive), and Kalamaili Nature Reserve (re-introduction) with Mongolian wild asses serving as a reference in the shared Kalamaili range. Over 60 ARGs were quantified across 6 samples at each site for Przewalski's horses while 46 ARGs for Mongolian wild asses. The re-introduced Przewalski's horses had significant losses of fecal ARGs in sharing number and relative abundance in comparison to the captive ones. The re-introduced Przewalski's horses had complex internal connections among the quantified fecal ARGs in expression potential (average relative abundance per quantified ARGs by antimicrobial category) and even more significant external connections with Mongolian wild asses than with captive horse. Overall, the re-introduction of Przewalski's horses achieved notable and progressive success in feralization. Tetracyclines resistance genes (Tetra-RGs) alone, with full quantification frequency, could quantitatively characterized this achievement. Ratio of Tetra-RGs to aminoglycosides resistant genes (Amino-RGs) would differentiate the feralization progress with orders of magnitude, for the re-introduced Przewalski's horses at 279 and the captive one at 11.7, against Mongolian wild asses at 0.86 in this study. The two ARGs-based indicators might be applicable to quantify feralization progress in re-introduction of other captive endangering or extinct animals with validations. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess the use of a newly developed aiming compression device (ACD) for screw insertion in non-fractured navicular bones (NB) in cadavers. Study design: Cadaveric study. Sample population: A total of 10 cadaveric front limbs of adult horses. Methods: Placement of a 3.5 mm cortical screw in non-fractured NB under radiographic guidance was performed in 10 cadaver limbs in a standing position. An ACD was used to stabilize the NB and to guide the drilling process. Preparation and surgical time as well as the number of radiographic images were noted. A postoperative scoring system was used to assess screw placement by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and gross examination by two evaluators. Results: The total procedure time was 25–62 min (median 33.5). During the procedure, 11–21 radiographs (median 18.5) were taken. The postoperative gross examination revealed an excellent screw placement in nine NB and poor in one. This could not be reliably assessed with post-procedure CBCT. Conclusion: The described technique achieves an excellent screw placement in 9/10 bones without disrupting the articular or flexural surface of the NB and with no protrusion of the screw head or tip, in a median procedure time of under 35 min. Clinical significance: Adequate screw placement is paramount for NB fracture repair. The described approach under radiographic guidance allows adequate screw placement using the ACD to stabilize the NB by lateral to medial compression. This technique facilitates adequate screw placement within the NB without the use of advanced imaging techniques. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Laminitis is a common and painful condition of the equine foot and approximately 90% of cases are associated with insulin dysregulation (ID) that is a central feature of the common endocrine disorder equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and occurs in a subset of animals with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction. Additional features of EMS include obesity, altered circulating concentrations of adipokines (particularly adiponectin and leptin) and hypertriglyceridaemia. Obesity, ID, hypoadiponectinaemia, hyperleptinaemia and an altered plasma lipid profile are also features of human metabolic syndrome (HMS) alongside hyperglycaemia. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of oral hypoglycaemic agents used in combination with lifestyle changes in the management of HMS. SGLT2 receptors are responsible for 90% of the renal glucose reabsorption that occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule. Thus, these drugs increase urinary glucose excretion by suppressing glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate resulting in urinary calorie loss with consequent weight loss and improvements in ID, hyperglycemia, hypoadiponectinaemia and hyperleptinaemia. There are no licenced veterinary drugs available for treating ID and preventing insulin-associated laminitis in horses. Thus, the use of SGLT2i for the control of equine hyperinsulinaemia with the goal of improving recovery from associated active laminitis or preventing future laminitis has recently been advocated. There are a small number of published studies reporting the use of the SGLT2i canagliflozin, ertugliflozin and velagliflozin to aid the management of equine ID. However, the doses used are largely extrapolated from human studies with limited consideration of species-specific variations. In addition, there is limited evaluation of the fundamental differences between ID in horses and humans, particularly the fact that most horses with ID remain hyperinsulinaemic but normoglycaemic such that increased urinary loss of glucose may not explain the beneficial effects of these drugs. Further study of the potential deleterious effects of treatment-associated hypertriglyceridaemia is required together with the effect of SGLT2i therapy on circulating concentrations of adipokines in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The preservation of genetic diversity in Algerian horse breeds is essential for their effective conservation and utilization. However, a current lack of knowledge about their diversity and genetics presents a significant challenge. This study aims to characterize the morphological features of three principal horse breeds in Algeria: Barb, Arabian-Barb, and Purebred Arab. We measured 26 morphological traits, calculated live weight and eight body indices, and evaluated three qualitative parameters: coat color, muzzle shape, and cephalic profile. Average values for these measurements were computed for each breed. We assessed the significance of these averages using multi-factor ANOVA and compared them using the Newman-Keuls homogeneity test with SAS software. The results reveal distinct morphological characteristics for each breed. The Barb breed has a distance between the internal angles of the eyes of 17.27 cm, a neck length of 63.46 cm, a leg length of 38 cm, an average withers height of 154.2 cm, a live weight of 429 kg, a thoracic perimeter of 175.85 cm, and a compactness index of 2.80. The Purebred Arab displays a distance between the internal angles of the eyes of 18.5 cm, a neck length of 59.5 cm, a leg length of 40.01 cm, an average withers height of 150.3 cm, a live weight of 377.64 kg, a thoracic perimeter of 162.8 cm, and a compactness index of 2.44. The Arabian-Barb breed, a result of crossbreeding, is highly heterogeneous and combines desirable traits from both parent breeds. A significant influence of sex was noted on the height at the withers (p<0.05), with males generally taller than females, who present wider chests and larger lower leg circumferences. © 2024, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

ABSTRACT: Background: Extended-spectrum β-lactamase -producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) are important zoonotic pathogens that can cause serious clinical infections, also in horses. Preventing the spread of ESBL-E, especially in the equine hospital environment, is key to reducing the number of difficult-to-treat infections. Estimating the local prevalence of ESBL-E in horses is crucial to establish targeted infection control programs at equine hospitals. We conducted a prevalence and risk factor study in equine patients on admission to an equine teaching hospital in Finland through a rectal ESBL-E screening specimen of the horse and a questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of ESBL-E in admitted horses was 3% (5/161, 95% CI 1–7%); none of the tested factors remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis, although antimicrobial treatment within three months was borderline significant (p = 0.052). Extended-spectrum β-lactamase -producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST6179:CTX-M-15 was detected in three horses using whole-genome sequencing, which in combination with patient records suggested nosocomial transmission. Escherichia coli isolates were ST1250:CTX-M-1 (n = 1), ST1079:CTX-M-1 (n = 1), and ST1245:CTX-M-14 (n = 1). Multiple virulence genes were detected in the ESBL-E isolates. In the ESBL-E positive horses enrolled in a one-year follow-up study, ESBL-E were unlikely to be isolated in rectal screening specimens after the initial positive specimen. Conclusions: The prevalence of ESBL-E in horses visiting a veterinary teaching hospital in Finland is low, indicating an overall low prevalence estimate in the country’s equine population. No statistically significant risk factors were identified, likely due to the low number of cases. The duration of ESBL-E carriage is likely to be very short in horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is a painful recurrent disease affecting 2%–5% of horses. Current treatments require frequent administration with associated adverse events. In a previous study, intravitreal (IVT) adeno-associated virus (AAV) harboring equine interleukin-10 (eqIL-10) cDNA inhibited experimental uveitis in rats. The goal of this study was to evaluate the ocular tolerability, vector genome (vg) distribution, and vector shedding following an IVT injection of AAV8-eqIL-10 in normal horses with the hypothesis that it would be well tolerated in a dose-dependent manner in horses. Injections were well tolerated with mild transient signs of ocular inflammation; however, horses receiving the highest dose developed keratic precipitates. The vgs were not detected in the tears 3 days after injection, or in urine or feces at any time. Aqueous and vitreous humor eqIL-10 levels increased to higher than 1.5 ng/mL, more than 20 times higher than reported effective endogenous and induced levels. The vgs were detected in ocular tissues, and systemic distribution was identified only in the liver and kidney. No systemic effects were identified 86 days after dosing with IVT AAV-eqIL-10. Further investigation of lower doses of IVT AAV8-eqIL-10 therapy is an important next step toward a safe and effective single-dose treatment of equine uveitis with broader implications for treating NIU in humans. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The sleeping and eating behaviors of horses are important indicators of their health. With the development of the modern equine industry, timely monitoring and analysis of these behaviors can provide valuable data for assessing the physiological state of horses. To recognize horse behaviors in stalls, this study builds on the SlowFast algorithm, introducing a novel loss function to address data imbalance and integrating an SE attention module in the SlowFast algorithm’s slow pathway to enhance behavior recognition accuracy. Additionally, YOLOX is employed to replace the original target detection algorithm in the SlowFast network, reducing recognition time during the video analysis phase and improving detection efficiency. The improved SlowFast algorithm achieves automatic recognition of horse behaviors in stalls. The accuracy in identifying three postures—standing, sternal recumbency, and lateral recumbency—is 92.73%, 91.87%, and 92.58%, respectively. It also shows high accuracy in recognizing two behaviors—sleeping and eating—achieving 93.56% and 98.77%. The model’s best overall accuracy reaches 93.90%. Experiments show that the horse behavior recognition method based on the improved SlowFast algorithm proposed in this study is capable of accurately identifying horse behaviors in video data sequences, achieving recognition of multiple horses’ sleeping and eating behaviors. Additionally, this research provides data support for livestock managers in evaluating horse health conditions, contributing to advancements in modern intelligent horse breeding practices. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Respiratory problems may be associated with pathogens among which viruses may play an important role in causing or promoting clinical signs. However, traditional diagnostic methods for equine infectious diseases, such as PCR, are limited to known pathogens and often miss rare or novel viruses. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing is a transformative method that allows the sequencing of all genomes present in a sample. Recent studies have used next-generation sequences to identify viral sequences in horses with unexplained respiratory symptoms, revealing potential links between viruses and respiratory problems. The aim of the study was to verify a relationship between respiratory diseases and the presence of viral agents through molecular analyses, applied to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from horses with history or presence of clinical signs of respiratory diseases. (2) Methods: A cohort of 14 horses was enrolled. All the subjects were submitted to a clinical assessment of the respiratory tract, thoracic ultrasound evaluation, respiratory tract endoscopy, and bronchoalveolar lavage. The latter one was used for cytological analysis, DNA and RNA extraction, and molecular biology analysis. (3) Results: No positive results were obtained in the molecular studies except for a sequence of 753 bp obtained by next-generation sequences, with complete homology to Equid gammaherpesvirus 2 strains. The samples were taken from a thoroughbred female horse aged 2 years old and referred for poor performance and sporadic cough at the beginning of the training session. (4) Conclusions: viral involvement may be not common in horses with respiratory diseases. We cannot exclude that the lack of virus detection may be due to the small sample size of the population included. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: To mitigate the use of antibiotics for many of the multifactorial diseases seen in pigs, horses and cattle, new diagnostic tools are needed. Acute phase protein (APP) measurements can, in humans, be used to guide antibiotic treatment initiation, evaluate treatment efficacy, and make a prognosis. The aim of this review is to collect evidence on the clinical functionality of APP measurements as a tool to guide antibiotic treatment in pigs, horses, and cattle. Literature was retrieved using Medline, CAB Abstracts and Google Scholar. The acute phase response has been investigated for a plethora of diseases and clinical signs and the major acute phase proteins are elevated in diseased compared to healthy animals. Few studies correlated acute phase response with aetiology, antibiotic treatment efficacy, prognosis, or severity of disease. The existing research does not support that APP can be used to guide antibiotic treatment, but the reported studies indicate that C-reactive protein (CRP) might be able to differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial causes of disease in pigs. Serum amyloid A (SAA) might reflect underlying aetiology in horses and infectious or non-infectious cases of mastitis in cows. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The use of Bio-Electro-Magnetic-Energy-Regulation (BEMER) therapy during general anesthesia has not previously been reported in horses. This randomized, investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluates equine cardiopulmonary function and recovery quality after BEMER therapy application for 15 min in 100 horses during general anesthesia using isoflurane for pars-plana vitrectomy surgery as treatment for recurrent uveitis. Visually identical blankets were used in the two groups (1:1 ratio), one with a functional BEMER module and the other with a placebo module. Arterial blood pressure, blood gas, lactate, and creatine kinase (CK) values were measured at different timepoints, and each timepoint was compared between the groups using paired t-tests. The quality of recovery from anesthesia was assessed by one blinded veterinary surgeon using a 10-category scoring system with scores ranging from 10 (best) to 72 (worst) and compared by an ordinary least squares regression analysis. The placebo group had a significantly better recovery (mean 16.1, standard deviation 7.15) than the BEMER-therapy group (mean 22.4, SD 13.0). Arterial blood pressure and blood lactate were lower in the BEMER-therapy group without reaching statistical significance, while CK and blood gas values were comparable. BEMER-horse therapy showed an effect on the recovery quality of horses undergoing general anesthesia. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The susceptibility of seven species of chestnuts to the horse chestnut leaf miner was studied in the arboretum of the Main Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences (MBG RAS), taking into account their interspecific characteristics. Using pheromone delta traps, the highest number of Cameraria ohridella moths was shown for Aesculus hippocastanum and the lowest for Aesculus chinensis. A number of anatomical parameters of leaves were investigated, such as the thickness of the epidermal cell wall and the thickness of the palisade and spongy parenchyma layers. As a result, it was shown that the most infected chestnut species had a greater thickness of the nutritious parenchyma tissue. No dependence was found between the degree of susceptibility to the horse chestnut leaf miner and such indicators as the content of chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids in the leaves of seven species of chestnuts. Nevertheless, resistance of different species of the genus Aesculus to Cameraria ohridella under increased tannin content in leaves has been shown. Evaluation of phenolic compounds and flavonoids has not established their reliable role as repellents. The high levels of carbohydrates found during the study contributed to increased susceptibility to the horse chestnut leaf miner. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of 1.5 mL 2% mepivacaine, 0.75 mL 2% mepivacaine, and a combination of 0.75 mL 2% mepi-vacaine with epinephrine (1:200,000 solution) administered over each palmar digital nerve (PDN) to 6 horses with naturally occurring lameness caused by digital pain. METHODS In a crossover study design, 6 horses with forefoot-related lameness were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Each group received, on different study days, a PDN block using 1.5 mL of 2% mepivacaine, 0.75 mL 2% mepivacaine, or 0.75 mL of a combination of 2% mepivacaine and epinephrine (1:200,000 solution) injected over each nerve. The horses’ gait while trotting was analyzed with an inertial, sensor-based motion-analysis system immediately before treatment. The assigned treatment was then administered to the lame forelimb, after which the gait was reevaluated at 5-minute intervals for 15 minutes. RESULTS All 3 treatments significantly reduced lameness scores at all gait evaluations, but the effect of treatment on the lameness score did not differ significantly among treatments. CONCLUSIONS 0.75 mL of mepivacaine hydrochloric acid injected over each PDN was as effective as twice that volume in decreas-ing the lameness score of horses with digital pain. The 0.75-mL solution of mepivacaine/epinephrine injected over each nerve did not significantly improve the anesthetic effect of mepivacaine. CLINICAL RELEVANCE For a palmar digital nerve block, a lower-than-commonly-recommended volume of 2% mepivacaine effectively ame-liorates digital pain. This finding invites investigation as to whether administering a low volume of local anesthetic will more precisely localize pain. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Lymphoma is the most common tumor of hematopoietic origin in horses. The course of the disease and clinical signs vary greatly, depending on tumor location and extent. The aim of this report is to describe the occurrence of T-cell-rich oral large B-cell lymphoma with marked local infiltration in a 25-year-old Crioula mare. The mare showed an increase in volume on the right side of its face, dyspnea, anorexia, and progressive weight loss. The clinical assessment showed that the lesion was located in the rostral and caudal sinuses and was markedly invasive to adjacent structures. The autopsy revealed a yellow mass with a soft to firm consistency, infiltrating multiple bones in the skull, and extensively invading the hard palate and masseter muscle. Histologically the mass comprised an undifferentiated malignant neoplasm characterized by a densely cellular neoplasm composed of large CD20 + neoplastic B-lymphocytes admixed with sheets of small, CD3 + reactive T-lymphocytes supported by delicate fibrovascular stroma leading to the diagnosis of oral T-cell-rich large B-cell lymphoma. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Controlling multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MRM) has a long history with the extensive and inappropriate use of antibiotics. At the cost of these drugs being scarce, new possibilities have to be explored to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Thus, metallic compounds have shown to be promising as a viable alternative to contain pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials. Gallium (Ga3+) can be highlighted, which is an antimicrobial agent capable of disrupting the essential activities of microorganisms, such as metabolism, cellular respiration and DNA synthesis. It was observed that this occurs due to the similar properties between Ga3+ and iron (Fe3+), which is a fundamental ion for the correct functioning of bacterial activities. The mimetic effect performed by Ga3+ prevents iron transporters from distinguishing both ions and results in the substitution of Fe3+ for Ga3+ and in adverse metabolic disturbances in rapidly growing cells. This review focuses on analyzing the development of research involving Ga3+, elucidating the intracellular incorporation of the “Trojan Horse”, summarizing the mechanism of interaction between gallium and iron and comparing the most recent and broad-spectrum studies using gallium-based compounds with antimicrobial scope. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Among numerous genes that have been a focus of equine genetic research, the KL (Klotho) and ACTN3 (Alpha-actinin-3) genes stand out due to their significant roles in muscle function and overall health, as well as performance ability. Previous studies on Arabian horses and other mammalians have shown that both KL and ACTN3 occur in different isoforms that seem to have different roles in metabolism. The main purpose of this present study was to describe different isoforms (ACTN3, ACTN3-201, ACTN3-202, KL, KL-202, KL-203) expression levels affected by the endurance effort in Arabian horses. Methods: Blood samples were taken from a group of n = 10 Arabian horses taking part in a long-distance 120 km endurance ride. After RNA isolation and reverse transcription, real-time PCR was performed. The expression levels (Relative Quantity, RQ) were calculated using the delta-delta CT method. The results showed surprisingly large differences between different isoforms expression levels which brought us to the conclusion that both KL and ACTN3 genes are suitable genetic markers to measure endurance performance. Moreover, the correlation network analyses showed that the MIOX (myo-inositol oxygenase), SH3RH2 (SH3 domain-containing ring finger 2) and TNNI2 (Troponin I2, fast skeletal type) genes are significantly involved in the endurance effort metabolism. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Estra-4,9-diene-3,17-dione (dienedione) is an anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) sold as a bodybuilding supplement. It is prohibited in both human and equine sports. With no report of 4,9-diene configuration in endogenous steroids, dienedione has long been considered a synthetic AAS. Nevertheless, the reoccurring detection of dienedione in colt (entire male horse) urine samples lead to the investigation of its possible endogenous nature in horses. This paper describes (i) the detection of naturally occurring dienedione in colts, (ii) the conjugation study of dienedione and (iii) the population study of free and glucuronide-conjugated dienedione in colt urine. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of dienedione content in colt urine were performed, employing liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). Qualitative analyses showed that dienedione was endogenous in colt urine and mainly in the form of glucuronide conjugates. Glucuronidation of dienedione was believed to happen at 3-enol leading to dienedione-3-glucuronide. Upon the population study of free and glucuronide-conjugated dienedione in colt urine samples (n = 175), the mean ± SD was determined to be 2.5 ± 3.5 ng/ml. The population data fitted a normal distribution after a fifth root transformation with the exclusion of one outlier by Grubb's test. A possible in-house threshold was proposed at 30 ng/ml of free and glucuronide-conjugated dienedione in colt urine associated with a risk factor of 1 in 14,269 (with a degree of freedom of 173). This is the first report of endogenous dienedione in entire male horses and the approach for controlling its potential misuse by using a threshold is also presented. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Microplastic pollution poses a significant environmental threat due to its persistence, widespread distribution, and inherent toxic potential. Despite the increasing number of publications in this field, a standardized protocol for the laboratory intake of microplastics by Daphnia magna has yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a verified protocol designed to facilitate the ingestion of microplastic particles (MPs) by D. magna, ranging in size from 5–55 µm. This protocol can be further applied to evaluate the toxicity of MPs on D. magna, a crucial organism model in ecotoxicology. Furthermore, this protocol can be used to assess toxicity of MPs in other aquatic species, such as fish, by using daphnids as a vehicle for ensuring the ingestion of these particles. Consequently, this protocol can be applied to study also one of the most pressing concerns regarding exposure to MPs, the transfer of MPs through different trophic levels, which has a great potential for ecotoxicological studies. • The influence of MPs concentration, duration and exposure dynamics and D. magna age/size in MPs intake were tested. • We have determined the optimal conditions for promoting microplastic ingestion by D. magna. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of pain and retirement in athletic horses. Hydro-expansive functionalized nanogels, acting as Drug Delivery Systems, constitute one of the current therapeutic prospects. These nanogels have the potential to combine mechanical benefits through polymers with the biological effect of prolonged release of bioactive molecules. The purpose of this double-blinded randomized tolerance study versus negative control was to evaluate the response of healthy joints to a single injection of the expected efficient dose (further referred to as the trial dose) and overdose of nanogels composed of chitosan and hyaluronic acid and featuring a type A endothelin receptor antagonist and a type B1 bradykinin receptor antagonist. The metacarpophalangeal joints of 8 healthy horses were randomly injected with 2.4 mL of functionalized nanogels and 2.4 mL of saline as control on the contralateral limb. Injections were repeated twice at one-week intervals, followed by injection of a triple dose of nanogel on week four. Clinical, ultrasonographic and synovial fluid cellular and biochemical follow-ups were performed up to three months following the first injection. RESULTS: No change in general clinical parameters, lameness or sensitivity to passive flexion of the fetlocks was noted. Mild to moderate synovitis was noted on the day following injection in the treated group, with a significant difference (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. It spontaneously resolved on day 3 following the injections and did not increase with repeated injections. Similar effects were noted after injection of the triple dose but lasted for a week. Synovial fluid markers of inflammation also showed a transient significant increase in the treated group one week after each injection, but no differences were detected at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Injections of the expected therapeutic dose of functionalized nanogel in healthy joints induced a mild transient inflammatory response in the joint. Three injections of the trial dose at one-week intervals and injection of thrice the trial dose induce a mildly greater inflammation without harmful effects on joints. Functionalized nanogels are well tolerated prospects for the treatment of osteoarthritis in horses. Their beneficial effects on arthritic joints have yet to be evaluated to determine their therapeutic potential. © 2024. The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Adulteration of meat products remains a significant issue worldwide. In this study, we developed a high-throughput, rapid, sensitive, and selective method for qualitative and quantitative detection of horse meat adulteration in meat products. This method, which is not only innovative but also highly practical, involves coupling a 96-well high-throughput DNA isolation process with recombinant enzyme polymerase amplification (RPA), magnetic separation (MS), and high-throughput fluorescence detection (FD). We designed a set of primers targeting the mitochondrial ATP6-8 gene of horses. The upper and lower primers were labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent moiety and biotin, respectively. Following RPA amplification, the amplicons were separated and purified using streptavidin-modified magnetic beads (MB@SA). Subsequently, the amplicons were qualified and quantified using a high-throughput fluorescence detection system. We optimized the conditions for primer addition, incubation time, and the ratio of amplicon to MB@SA. Our results showed that a fluorescence threshold of 834 indicated positive detection. The method exhibited high specificity, with no positive amplification observed in DNA from the other 11 types of meat. It demonstrated high sensitivity and was capable of detecting as little as 0.1% (wt%) of horse meat in adulterated samples. Combined with our developed 96-well high-throughput DNA extraction system, the RPA-MS-FD assay process could analyze 96 samples in 31.5 min, including 11.5 min for rapid DNA extraction, 15 min for RPA amplification, and 5 min for fluorescence detection. Finally, we successfully applied this assay to analyze 21 commercial meat products, proving its practicality and effectiveness. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The ACOX1 gene is vital for fatty acid metabolism and is linked to environmental stress and physical exertion adaptation. The p.Asp237Ser variant (rs782885985) in ACOX1 is associated with increased enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This study examined the ACOX1 polymorphism across six horse breeds in Iran: Arabian, Thoroughbred, KWPN, Caspian, Kurdish, and Turkmen. The goal was to identify differences in ACOX1 genotype distribution, potentially serving as genetic markers under selection pressure related to breed-specific traits. In a sample of 324 horses, genomic DNA was analyzed using PCR-RFLP, revealing three genotypes (TT, TG, GG). The GG genotype was most common in Kurdish and Arabian horses (86% and 70%, respectively), while the TT genotype was prevalent in Turkmen (24%) and Thoroughbred horses (23%). The T allele’s frequency in Thoroughbred and Turkmen horses suggests that ACOX1 may be under selection pressure for phenotypic traits. Differences in genotype distribution were confirmed among breeds, with no sex-based association. The study concludes that ACOX1 is a potential genetic marker for horse performance and adaptability, emphasizing the importance of genetic diversity in breeding programs. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Levamisole is a regulated substance sometimes administered to racehorses to treat equine protozoal myelitis. Metabolites include compound II, aminorex, and pemoline. Aminorex and pemoline are Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority–banned substances. Previous studies have examined single doses of the drug. This study examined the disposition of levamisole after 7 days of dosing. ANIMALS 6 healthy Thoroughbred geldings. METHODS Horses were treated with 500 mg (approx 0.91 to 1 mg/kg) of compounded levamisole hydrochloride paste PO every 12 hours for a total of 13 doses over 7 days. Serum and urine samples were analyzed for levamisole and its metabolites over a 28-day period. RESULTS The terminal half-life of levamisole in serum was variable between horses. Following the last dose of levamisole on day 7, serum levamisole levels took 3 to 14 days (days 10 to 21) to fall below the limit of detection (LOD) in 5 of 6 horses. Serum from 1 horse remained over LOD on the last testing day (day 28). In urine, following the final dose (day 7), levamisole was below LOD on day 13 (6 days after final dose) and aminorex was below LOD on day 10 (3 days after final dose). Compound II was above LOD in 4 of 5 horses sampled on the last sampling day (day 28). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Levamisole and its metabolites can be detected for variable lengths of time in horses, with detection lasting for days to weeks following multiple doses. This study supports the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium Advisory on levamisole, which suggests that clearance sample testing should be conducted on treated horses to verify elimination of levamisole and its metabolites. ©AVMA.

ABSTRACT: Insulin dysregulation (ID) is associated with an increased risk of laminitis which often necessitates the need for clinical intervention. To test the contention that the prophylactic supplementation of nutraceuticals could mitigate ID in susceptible horses, 16 mature horses with a history of ID were supplemented with either the placebo (n = 8) or nutraceutical (n = 8) once daily. Horses were housed in dry lots with ad libitum access to grass hay and fed a concentrate twice daily to provide 0.5 g starch/kg BW/meal. A combined glucose–insulin tolerance test was performed on all horses before and after 4 weeks of treatment. Nutraceutical-supplemented horses had 61% greater (p = 0.05) glucose clearance rates compared to the placebo group. This resulted in a shorter time in the positive phase of glucose clearance (p = 0.03) for the nutraceutical group compared to the placebo group. Horses receiving the nutraceutical had lower (p = 0.003) insulin concentrations at 75 min and lower (p = 0.04) glucose concentrations at 45 min compared to the placebo. Prophylactic supplementation with nutraceuticals resulted in greater glucose clearance rates during a starch challenge, indicating that nutraceuticals can mitigate ID in susceptible horses consuming an excess of non-structural carbohydrate. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Bacteria-mediated antitumor therapy has gained widespread attention for its innate tumor-targeting capability and excellent immune activation properties. Nevertheless, the clinical approval of bacterial therapies remains elusive primarily due to the formidable challenge of balancing safety with enhancing in vivo efficacy. In this study, leveraging the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle1917 (EcN) emerges as a promising approach for colon cancer therapy, offering a high level of safety attributed to its lack of virulence factors and its tumor-targeting potential owing to its obligate anaerobic nature. Specifically, we delineate the erythrocyte (RBC) membrane-camouflaged EcN, termed as Trojan horse EcN@RBC, which triggers apoptosis in tumor cells by mitigating mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and subsequently activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway associated with mitophagy. Concurrently, the decline in MMP induced by mitophagy disrupts the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), leading to the release of Cytochrome C and subsequent apoptosis induction. Moreover, synergistic effects were observed through the combination of the autophagy activator rapamycin, bolstering the antitumor efficacy in vivo. These findings offer novel insights into probiotic-mediated antitumor mechanisms and underscore the therapeutic potential of EcN@RBC for colon cancer patients. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Neuromuscular block (NMB) during general anaesthesia has an implicit risk of inadvertent residual NMB during recovery. Reversal of NMB is commonly encouraged to decrease this risk, and has historically been performed with neostigmine/atropine, two agents with important cardiac and gastrointestinal side effects. Sugammadex is a new selective relaxant binding agent that can reverse rocuronium-induced NMB efficiently and without these complications. Recommended doses are possibly cost-prohibitive. Objectives: To measure the recovery time from rocuronium-NMB after administration of low-dose sugammadex, compared with spontaneous recovery. Study design: Nonrandomised in vivo experiments. Methods: Fourteen adult horses undergoing different research procedures were anaesthetised with detomidine and isoflurane. All horses received NMB with rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg IV. Neuromuscular function was measured with acceleromyographic train-of-four (TOF) ratio. Recovery occurred spontaneously in five horses weighing (median [range]) 548 (413–594) kg and was enhanced with sugammadex 200 mg (total dose) in nine horses (433 [362–515]) kg. Recovery time from moderate NMB to a TOF ratio 1.0, and total duration of NMB were compared between groups. Cases of recurarisation (decrease in the TOF ratio <0.9 after recovery) were identified within 30 min after sugammadex. Results: The dose of sugammadex was 0.46 (0.39–0.55) mg/kg. The recovery period lasted 21 (17–39) minutes for spontaneous and 4 (3–7) minutes for sugammadex. Total duration of NMB was 58 (41–70) minutes for spontaneous and 36 (21–43) for sugammadex (both p ≤ 0.003). There were no instances of recurarisation. Main limitations: Small sample size. Conclusions: A dose of sugammadex of approximately 0.5 mg/kg substantially shortened the recovery period from rocuronium-induced NMB from a median of 21 to 4 min, when given at a moderate depth of NMB. No recurarisation was observed within the next 30 min. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The mechanisms of the innate immunity control of equine infectious anemia virus in horses are not yet widely described. Equine monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of three Equine infectious anemia (EIA) seronegative horses were differentiated in vitro into macrophages that gave rise to mixed cell populations morphologically referable to M1 and M2 phenotypes. The addition of two equine recombinant cytokines and two EIA virus reference strains, Miami and Wyoming, induced a more specific cell differentiation, and as for other species, IFNγ and IL4 stimulation polarized horse macrophages respectively towards the M1 and the M2 phenotypes. Infection with EIAV reference strains resulted in a morphological transformation of macrophages compatible with the M1 differentiation pattern. All samples were also analyzed by molecular analyses for equine herpesviruses that could have acted as an interference and were found to be negative. The mRNA expression level of the pro-inflammatory genes MMP13 and IL6 in treated equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) was evaluated by a SYBR® Green real-time PCR. In this study, MMP13 represented a reliable target gene to evaluate pro-inflammatory status of macrophages in horses because IFNγ and EIAV infection considerably increased its expression. A more in-depth study of the expression genes of both cytokine-induced and virus-induced markers of eMDM polarization may help us to understand whether these markers in horses are the same as those found in other animal species with similar pathways of innate immunity activation. The identified markers of each macrophage population would allow analysis of the differentiation profiles that could provide information on virus infectivity control in equid populations, envisioning their use in therapeutic strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE This study investigated the effects of recombinant equine IL-31 (eIL-31) in vivo and in vitro. METHODS Equine IL-31 mRNA sequences were verified by sequencing. Recombinant eIL-31 was produced using mammalian and bacterial expression systems. From November 2019 through February 2021, 12 normal horses, 6 to 10 years old with no history or clinical signs consistent with allergic skin disease, were injected ID with eIL-31 and saline in 2 challenge studies. Pruritus-associated behaviors were recorded for a minimum of 15 minutes preinjection and 4 hours postinjection. Adherent monocytes from 3 pruritic horses, exhibiting insect bite hypersensitivity and/or atopic der-matitis, were stimulated with bacterial eIL-31, and subsequent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was measured by western blot and AlphaLISA. RESULTS The bacterial eIL-31 was produced with greater purity than the mammalian eIL-31 (> 95% vs 70%). Pruritus was elic-ited by both recombinant proteins. The mammalian eIL-31 induced mild pruritus (cumulative seconds spent itching postinjection ranged from 6 to 313). The bacterial eIL-31 induced marked pruritus in some horses (a cumulative maximum of 5,529 seconds spent itching in 1 horse) and a milder response in others (range of cumulative seconds spent itching, 17 to 2,313). Most pruritus occurred after 2 hours and subsided by 4 hours postinjection. Bacterial eIL-31 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in adherent monocytes from allergic horses. CONCLUSIONS In this proof-of-concept study, IL-31 was found to mediate pruritus and was associated with STAT3 phosphorylation in horses as in other species. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Interleukin 31 is a promising therapeutic target for equine allergic pruritus. © 2024 THE AUTHORS. Published by the American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: The conjunctiva of the eye is a mucosal surface that is colonised by various bacteria. Following surgery, trauma or other underlying conditions the normal flora may cause eye infection such as conjunctival and corneal infections, or endophthalmitis. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the bacterial population and antibiotic resistance of the conjunctiva in healthy horses. Study design: Random sampling of ocular samples from 20 horses during the winter (2019). Methods: Swab samples were collected from the eyes of 20 healthy horses of different breeds, ages and sexes in Tehran province, Iran. The swabs were cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar and incubated at 37°C for 24–48 h. The isolated bacteria were characterised using cellular morphology, gram-staining and biochemical tests. Sensitivity and resistance to 10 different antibiotics were measured using an antibiogram test. Results: Results showed that the bacterial population consisted of various species, with Bacillus cereus being the most frequent. There were no significant differences in the frequency of isolated bacteria between sexes and age groups. There were no significant differences in the sensitivity of the bacterial flora of the eyes to colistin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, amoxicillin and ampicillin between either different age groups or different sexes of the horses (p > 0.05). However, sensitivity to enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was significantly correlated with the age groups of the horses (p > 0.05). A significant difference in sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole between various sexes of horses was observed. Main limitations: The nonuniformity of the follow-up examination, reliance on owners or caregivers of the horse for follow-up information and lack of adequate financial resources to study more horses. Conclusions: The study suggests that the frequency of individual bacteria comprising the bacterial flora in horses' eyes is influenced by housing and management conditions rather than age and sex. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE The objective of this Case Report was to describe the clinical manifestation and postmortem findings of a horse evaluated for recurrent colic diagnosed with pyloric aplasia and an ectopic duodenal papilla. ANIMAL 13-year-old Quarter Horse gelding. CLINICAL PRESENTATION, PROGRESSION, AND PROCEDURES The horse was presented to a referral center for signs of colic that were unresponsive to management on the farm. No abnormalities were noted on rectal palpation; however, upon passage of a nasogastric tube, 31 L of net gastric reflux was obtained. Gastroscopy noted grade IV squamous ulceration and moderate glandular ulceration, severe gastric dilatation, an abnormally positioned gastric outflow tract, and an ectopic duodenal papilla leaking bile-like fluid directly into the stomach. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME The horse was initially treated with gastroprotectants, promotility agents, and dietary modifications. Following treatment failure and repeated episodes of colic with increasing severity, the horse was euthanized and a necropsy performed. At necropsy, it was confirmed that the aboral aspect of the stomach formed a dilated pouch and continued directly into the proximal duodenum with no discernible pyloric sphincter. The area of the pylorus was delineated by a faint indentation. The ectopic duodenal papilla was traced to the liver. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Congenital gastric abnormalities, even in adult horses, should be considered as differential diagnoses when investigating horses presenting with a history of chronic colic. Neither pyloric aplasia nor an ectopic duodenal papilla have been described in the equine literature, and this Case Report raises awareness of the presence of such malformations and their manifestations. ©AVMA.

ABSTRACT: Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites are a global concern and cause serious damage to the health of animals, including horses, because of their deleterious effects on the health of these animals. Owing to improperly diagnosing the parasitic load and the resulting incorrect treatment, anthelmintics are becoming a global problem. Although rapid diagnostic techniques such as McMaster and FECPAKG2 are available in Africa, concentration techniques, including flotation and sedimentation, are commonly used in screening for gastrointestinal parasites. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of diagnostic techniques, namely, McMaster and FECPAKG2, in quantifying and determining the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites as an alternative to the commonly used flotation and sedimentation techniques for equine fecal samples in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Three hundred fecal samples were collected from different locations. The instructions provided by the manufacturers of FECPAKG2 and McMasters were used as the methodology for egg count per gram of fecal matter, while parasite egg/ova identification was performed through sedimentation and flotation techniques. In general, a prevalence of 66.3% was recorded, with a higher prevalence on Babale ranch (84%) than on Jos Polo Club (62%) and Jos mounted troop (53%). A total of nine gastrointestinal parasites were identified via both sedimentation and flotation techniques: Strongylus spp. (19.3%) was the most prevalent parasite identified via the flotation method, whereas Gastrodiscus aegyptiacus (25.3%) was the most prevalent parasite identified via the sedimentation technique. In general, FECPAKG2 had a sensitivity of 86%, whereas McMaster had a sensitivity of 64% in terms of egg counts per gram of fecal sample. This finding suggests that equines in Jos are highly infected with a variety of gastrointestinal parasites to varying degrees, with Strongylus spp. and Gastrodiscus aegyptiacus being more prevalent. Although the parasite load was found to range from low to moderate levels, the majority of the equine samples contained < 200 eggs per gram, suggesting a low infection rate via both the McMaster technique and the FECPAKG2 technique. On the basis of these findings, FECPAKG2 is recommended for rapid diagnosis because of its prompt outcome and infestation rate as well as ease of routine examination. Additionally, routine examination should be carried out to determine infestation by gastrointestinal parasites in all equine holdings and the effectiveness of the therapeutic agents used. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Lipizzan is a famous horse breed dating back to 1580 when the original stud of Lipica was established by the Hasburg Archduke Charles II. Currently, the Italian State Stud of Lipizzan Horses (ASCAL) is a conservation nucleus managed through strict mating rules where mitochondrial DNA sequences are used to verify the correct assignment of mares to a historical pedigree maternal lineage. Here, we analyzed the D-loop sequences of Lipizzan horses from the ASCAL in Monterotondo (Rome, Italy) in order to confirm their pedigree assignment to known female founder families. The concurrent investigation of the paternal counterpart based on variation in the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) showed a prevalence of HT02 (80%), typical of the Neapolitan/Oriental wave. The mtDNA polymorphisms identified shaped nine haplotypes that were unequivocally assigned to each of nine classical mare families of the stud (Africa, Almerina, Argentina, Deflorata, Djebrin, Fistula, Ivanka, Sardinia, Spadiglia), while the Europa and Theodorosta families shared a tenth haplotype. New polymorphisms were identified in a not previously studied region (np 16100–16350). The mtDNA phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Lipizzans of the Monterotondo stud belong to six haplogroups (B, C, G, L, M, Q), out of the 18 recorded for the equine species. This work enabled us to identify and preserve ten haplotypes from the historical maternal lines in a small stud kept in genetic segregation for over 100 years. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cellulitis is a commonly observed condition in horses, which often requires an urgent or emergency veterinary visit. The condition often presents with acute-onset diffuse limb swelling, heat, pitting oedema and pain on palpation of the affected limb. Lameness is variable but can be severe and the horse may display signs of extreme discomfort, alongside tachycardia, tachypnoea and pyrexia. Risk factors such as blunt trauma, recent wounds, recent surgery or recent injections have been identified, and studies suggest that cellulitis is more common in the hindlimbs than forelimbs. Aim of the article: This article provides an overview of the physiology of oedema formation and discusses the diagnosis and treatment options available for cases of cellulitis in horses. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine veterinarians performing chiropractic treatments are frequently asked to evaluate and treat sound horses to improve their performance and address pain associated with the axial skeleton. Studies describing the effects and mechanisms of chiropractic treatments in horses without overt lameness are scarce. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of chiropractic treatments on stride rate, length, symmetry, heart rate and rider-perceived quality of the ridden work in sport horses. Study design: A blind randomised controlled trial with crossover design. Methods: Thirty-eight horses ridden in the hunter–jumper discipline were enrolled. Exercise tests were recorded before and after chiropractic or sham treatment while horses were wearing a fitness tracker. Stride length, rate and symmetry, heart rate and the perceived quality of the ridden work were compared. Results: There was a difference in the qualitative assessment of the ridden work by riders between treatments (odds ratio 33.8, 95% CI [4.68, 458.71], p < 0.01). Stride length, rate, symmetry and heart rate were not different between treatments. Main limitations: The quantitative outcomes measured may not be sensitive enough to detect changes that improve the ridden work. Terrain, weather and rider were not standard across horses making small changes difficult to detect. Conclusions: Riders participating in a blind randomised controlled trial perceived a positive effect of chiropractic treatments on the quality of the ridden work. There were no differences in stride length, stride rate, stride symmetry or heart rate. The mechanisms, indications and potential benefits of chiropractic treatments in horses need further study. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The growth and development of myofibers, as the fundamental units comprising muscle tissue, and their composition type are indeed among the most crucial factors influencing skeletal muscle types. Muscle fiber adaptation is closely associated with alterations in physiological conditions. Muscle fiber types undergo dynamic changes in fetus and adult horses. Our aim is to investigate the mechanisms influencing the differences in muscle fiber types between fetal and adult stages of Mongolian horses. The study investigated the distribution of muscle fiber types within longissimus dorsi muscle of fetus and adult Mongolian horses. A total of 652 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 476 Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs), and 174 Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIRs) were identified using deep RNA-seq analysis. The results of functional analysis reveal the transformations in muscle fiber type from the fetal to adult stage in Mongolian horses. The up-regulated DEGs were implicated in the development and differentiation of muscle fibers, while down-regulated DEGs were associated with muscle fiber contraction, transformation, and metabolism. Additionally, connections between non-coding RNA and mRNA landscapes were identified based on their functional alterations, some non-coding RNA target genes may be associated with immunity. These data have broadened our understanding of the specific roles and interrelationships among regulatory molecules involved in Mongolian horse development, this provides new perspectives for selecting and breeding superior individuals and for disease prevention. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife managers and the public have expressed considerable interest in the use of contraception to help manage the populations of wild horses and burros (Equus caballus and E. asinus). Field testing has shown that two preparations of the porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccine, a simple emulsion (ZonaStat-H) and PZP-22 (which supplements ZonaStat-H with a controlled-release component) effectively prevent pregnancy in individual mares and can substantially reduce population foaling rates. To determine whether some PZP preparations might have secondary effects that harm treated mares or their foals, we examined the effects of PZP-22 vaccinations and the follow-up boosters of either PZP-22 or ZonaStat-H on adult female body condition, foaling season, and foal mortality in two wild horse herds in the western USA, Cedar Mountains Herd Management Area, Utah (CM; 2008–2015), and Sand Wash Basin Herd Management Area, Colorado (SWB; 2008–2014). At both sites in every study year, summer body condition scores improved faster in mares without foals than mares with foals (p < 0.001; CM, n = 234; SWB, n = 172), but PZP treatments did not affect mare body condition apart from their contraceptive effects. Births to mares treated with PZP within the previous three years were delayed and spread out over the foaling season, but foal mortality rates through the first and second year were low, unrelated to date of birth, and virtually identical for the foals of PZP-treated and untreated mothers (all comparisons n.s.; CM, n = 775, SWB, n = 640). Thus, in these two populations, we found no evidence that changes in reproductive timing associated with PZP treatments were harmful to either mares or foals. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this retrospective clinical study was to compare the combinations of ketamine/diazepam (KD group) and tiletamine/zolazepam (TZ group) for the induction of general anaesthesia in horses undergoing elective surgery. The data from the clinical and the anaesthetic records of 138 horses from 2021 to 2023 were evaluated, and the horses were divided in two groups: KD (n = 60) and TZ (n = 72). The horses were premedicated with romifidine and methadone IV; anaesthesia was induced with ketamine/diazepam for the KD group and tiletamine/zolazepam for the TZ group and was maintained with isoflurane and a constant rate infusion of romifidine. The data encompassed sex and neuter status, age, breed, weight, American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status, type of surgical procedure performed under anaesthesia, induction time, induction score, surgery time, recovery time, and the recovery score using a descriptive scale. Baseline heart rate (HR), intraoperative HR, baseline respiratory rate (fR), intraoperative fR, mean arterial pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and fraction of expired isoflurane (FE’Iso) were also recorded. The induction time was significantly longer (p = 0.004) in the TZ group (60 (40–120)) as compared to the KD group (50 (30–120)). Recovery time was also significantly longer (p ≤ 0.001) in the TZ group (46.5 (15–125)) as compared to the KD group (30 (5–105)). These findings suggested that, in adult horses undergoing elective surgery, TZ could be considered a valid alternative to KD for the induction of general anaesthesia. Additional experimental studies comparing the two induction regimens and their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics are needed. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and association of EGUS in horses of different ages, breeds and occupations. Gastroscopies were performed on 395 horses, and gastric ulcers were graded on a scoring system from 0 to 4. The relationship between age, breed, and work, along with the prevalence of gastric ulcers and their influences, were evaluated. The prevalence rate of ulcers in this herd was 78%. Older horses were prone to ulcers in both the glandular and squamous mucosal areas. Across the different jobs surveyed, 60% of the horses had a score of 2 or above. For the horses participating in more intense jobs (group performances, pulling carts, etc.), the number of horses with an ulcer score of 2 or above exceeded 50% of the total number of horses in this job. The prevalence of gastric ulcers was high, and these ulcers were severe in the horses belonging to the examined club, with no association between age or breed and the prevalence of ulcers; however, there was a difference in the location of the ulcers between breeds, as well as differences in the incidence and severity of ulcers depending on work activity. This study provides data reference values for the control and prevention of gastric ulcers in horses in this horse farm. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We described the first case of rhinofacial pythiosis with dissemination in an adult horse in Uruguay. The affected horse presented a partially circumscribed mass measuring 30 x 23 x 9 cm affecting the right side of the face with involvement of cutaneous, subcutaneous, and muscular tissues, the right nasal cavity, and adjacent structures. At postmortem examination, the main lesions were “kunkers” characterized by pyogranulomatous and eosinophilic dermatitis, Splendore-Hoeppli reaction and numerous intralesional hyphae immunolabeling with polyclonal anti-Pythium insidiosum antibody. Similar lesions were observed in the lung and submandibular lymph nodes. The diagnosis was made by the characteristic histological lesions and the strong immunolabelling by anti-P. insidiosum antibody. © 2025, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Gastric pH is a key factor in the development of equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD). Although acid injury is unlikely the primary cause of equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD), low pH may promote mucosal damage. Gastric pH is influenced by roughage uptake, as chewing increases the alkaline saliva production. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole is currently recommended by the American/European College of Veterinary/Equine Internal Medicine (ACVIM/ECEIM) for ESGD and EGGD. We hypothesized that dental disorders decrease saliva production and gastric pH, predisposing horses to EGUS. Gastroscopy, intragastric pH measurement and dental examinations were performed (n = 54). Omeprazole therapy was recommended (n = 32), dental disorders were corrected (n = 22) and gastroscopy was repeated 4 weeks later (n = 9). An influence of moderate to severe dental disorders on ESGD (grade ≥ 2/4) (p = 0.394) and EGGD (grade ≥ 2/3) (p = 0.857) could not be determined. Nevertheless, there was a trend that moderate to severe dental disorders were associated with a low gastric pH ≤ 4 (p = 0.100). Horses with no or mild dental problems had a mean pH of 5.4 versus 4.2 in moderate to severe dental disorders. In conclusion, our study results do not show a direct relationship between dental disorders and EGUS, but a gastric and oral cavity examination should still be considered in patients presented for weight loss or inappetence. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: It was assumed that the full-blink and half-blink rates (eye blink rate, EBR) increased in horses after stress, with these rates decreasing gradually after that. This study aimed to analyze the horses’ EBR for three minutes following exposure to a stressor. The tests were conducted on ten horses at rest /before test/ after a test involving a new object. The EBR was analyzed using Kinovea software [version 0.9.5]. Moreover, HR was measured with a stethoscope, and behavior was assessed using a 5-point scale. Compared to rest and pre-test, HR post-test increased significantly, and scores for behavior decreased during the test. There were no significant differences between EBRs in consecutive minutes at rest and pre-test. After the test, only the frequency of half-blinks and full-blinks and half-blinks together decreased significantly in the following minutes of measurement. Significant differences between EBR at rest and after the test and between EBR before and after the test occurred at each minute of the test. Only in the case of behavioral assessment and HR, the results correlated significantly. It was concluded that the analysis of EBR as a method for assessing horse stress should not be regarded as fully reliable and effective at this stage of research, as the results from this range did not correlate with the HR and the scores for behavior. In addition, it was suggested that the full-blink rate was worth using for further research. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Swimming has been used empirically for rehabilitation and conditioning of horses. However, due to challenges imposed by recording physiological parameters in water, the intensity of free swimming effort is unknown. Objectives: Measure the physiological workload associated with untethered swimming in horses. Five fit Arabian endurance horses were assessed while swimming in a 100 m-long indoor pool. Horses were equipped with a modified ergospirometry facemask to measure oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and ventilatory parameters (inspired/expired volumes, VI, VE; peak inspiratory/expiratory flows, PkVI, PkVE; respiratory frequency, Rf; minute ventilation, VE; inspiratory/expiratory durations and ratios, tI, tE, tI/ttot, tE/ttot); and an underwater electrocardiogram that recorded heart rate (HR). Postexercise venous blood lactate and ammonia concentrations were measured. Data are reported as median (interquartile ranges). Results: Horses showed bradypnea (12 breaths/min (10–16)) for the first 30 s of swimming. V̇O2 during swimming was 43.2 ml/(kg.min) (36.0–56.6). Ventilatory parameters were: VI = 16.7 L (15.3–21.8), VE = 14.7 L (12.4–18.9), PkVI = 47.8 L/s (45.8–56.5), PkVE = 55.8 L/s (38.3–72.5), Rf = 31.4 breaths/min (20.0–33.8), VE = 522.9 L/min (414.7–580.0), tI = 0.5 s (0.5–0.6), tE = 1.2 s (1.1–1.6), tI/ttot = 0.3 (0.2–0.4), tE/ttot = 0.7 (0.6–0.8). Expiratory flow tracings showed marked oscillations that coincided with a vibrating expiratory sound. HR was 178.0 bpm (148.5–182.0), lactate = 1.5 mmol/L (1.0–1.9) and ammonia = 41.0 µmol/L (36.5–43.5). Conclusions: Free (untethered) swimming represents a submaximal, primarily aerobic exercise in horses. The breathing pattern during swimming is unique, with a relatively longer apneic period at the beginning of the exercise and an inspiratory time less than half that of expiration. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Millions of working equids provide socio-economic support for many low-income communities worldwide. With the prevalence of harness-related wounds reported as higher than 60%, this study aims to describe the equipment used by working equids in three locations of the Ethiopian national regional state of Oromia (Fiche, Bishoftu and Shashamene), and the attitudes and practices of equid owners, users and harness makers regarding work equipment. This mixed-methods study consists of cross-sectional surveying of working equids used for taxi or transport of goods or water, as well as cart-driver questionnaires and focus groups (FG) with working equid stakeholders. Activities conducted with FG included participatory ranking of equipment attributes and equipment drawing exercises. Indicators of equipment design and assembly, as well as cart-driver attitudes and practices were described quantitatively. Associations between equipment characteristics and species, work-type and cart-driver indicators were investigated through univariable logistic regression models, whereas focus group discussions were transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: In total, 368 working equid surveys and cart-driver questionnaires were completed and 87 participants took part in nine FG. Equipment composition and characteristics differed considerably from ideal animal draught and harnessing principles described in the literature, with none of the observed harnesses adhering to all principles and thus not considered fully adequate. Various harness compositions were used, with only saddles and breast collars present in all. Donkey equipment had fewer components than that of horses, such as swingle trees (OR 0.02; 95% CI 0.01–0.06; p < 0.001) or girths (OR 0.09; 95%CI 0.02–0.4; p = 0.002). Horse equipment was more likely to have functional elements such as breeching (OR 7.8; 95% CI 2.9–20.9; p < 0.001). Of all equipment attributes, FG participants ranked cost, design and impact on animal wellbeing as having the highest importance. Thematic analysis identified motivations and priorities regarding equipment; awareness and knowledge of design and function; barriers to using ideal equipment; and consequences of equipment design and practices as key themes. Conclusions: Various weaknesses of design, assembly and use of equid work equipment were identified. Promoting behavioural change through awareness and training could lead to a sustainable improvement of work equipment quality, access, and prevention of equipment-related problems. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 as a zootechnical feed additive for several animal species. The additive, existing in a not-coated and a coated form, is currently authorised for use in feed for calves, cattle for fattening, dairy cows, dairy goats and dairy sheep, lambs, all minor ruminant species for fattening and rearing, horses and camelids for fattening and rearing. This application regards the request for the extension of use in all ruminants and camelids reared for milk production/suckling/reproduction, all minor (young) ruminant species and camelids for fattening and Equidae other than horses, and the modification of the authorisation for lambs to reduce the minimum use level. The identity of the active agent as S. cerevisiae was confirmed. Based on the qualified presumption of safety approach and since no concerns are expected from other components, the additive is considered safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. The not-coated form of the additive is not irritant to skin or eyes. The additive in both formulations should be considered a skin and respiratory sensitiser and any exposure through skin and respiratory tract is considered a risk. No conclusion could be drawn on the eye irritation potential of the coated form of the additive due to the lack of data. The additive has the potential to be efficacious when used in feed for all ruminants and camelids reared for milk production/suckling/reproduction at the minimum proposed use level of 5 × 108 CFU (colony forming unit)/kg complete feed, all minor (young) ruminant species and camelids for fattening and lambs at 1 × 109 CFU/kg complete feed, and in all Equidae species other than horses at 3 × 109 CFU/kg complete feed. © 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

ABSTRACT: Colic in horses is a common condition that can affect different organs of the abdominal cavity. In recent years, attempts have been made to associate this pathology with changes that occur in the intestinal microbiome. Through a case–control study, we analyzed the intestinal microbiome of a group of healthy horses and another with colic by massive sequencing of 16S rRNA to observe the differences in the bacterial composition and functionality of these groups. The intestinal microbiomes of both groups are dominated by the phyla Firmicuteota, Bacteroidota, and Pseudomonadota. The abundance of Firmicuteota was negatively correlated with Pseudomonadota and Actinobacteriota in horses with colic. The microbiome of equine colic was predicted to be enriched with aerobic respiration pathways and fatty acid and amino acid degradation, observations that indicate discrete but important differences in the intestinal microbiome of horses with colic, which correlate with a more pro-inflammatory microbial community. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To describe the treatment of subcutaneous lipomas in the horse. ANIMALS 3 horses. CLINICAL PRESENTATION The horses were aged 1 to 2 years old, with lipomas of the abdomen, prepuce, and tarsus. RESULTS All cases had surgical removal of the masses under general anesthesia. Recurrence of an invasive abdominal lipoma occurred in case 1 at the exit site of a passive drain. The recurrence was treated unsuccessfully with injectable cisplatin, and a second revision surgery with the use of an active drain resulted in resolution. In case 2, complete resection of an encapsulated lipoma of the lateral prepuce was successful with no recurrence. In case 3, incomplete resection of a tarsal lipoma resulted in a sound horse, with no further growth. Histopathologic analysis revealed that all masses were composed of well-differentiated adipocytes with no evidence of malignancy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Subcutaneous lipomas are relatively rare and affect horses primarily ≤ 2 years of age. They are benign, although their presence can be deleterious due to invasion of local structures or the impact on normal locomotion. The margins of invasive tumors are difficult to identify due to their integration with normal tissue. Incomplete removal may allow for mass recurrence. Active suctions drains are beneficial if dead space is a concern. ©AVMA.

ABSTRACT: Background: Global technological advancements have shifted equine lameness diagnostics from purely subjective assessment toward more objective, quantitative methods. Traditional gait evaluations are increasingly being supplemented by innovative technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Aim: This study aimed to determine if traditional gait assessment could be effectively complemented by quantitative measurements using an affordable, self-constructed device, the Lameness Detector 0.1, which incorporates inertial motion sensors. Methods: A total of 42 adult sport horses diagnosed with hindleg lameness due to osteochondritis dissecans were assessed pre- and post-intra-articular anesthesia using both subjective evaluation and the Lameness Detector 0.1. Quantitative data were collected by recording electric impulses on the device's accelerometer across three axes (X, Y, Z). Statistical analysis was performed to compare pre- and post-joint block values, stratified by lameness degree, and to analyze correlations between quantitative measurements and subjective evaluations. Results: Significant differences were observed on the X-axis (p < 0.001) between pre- and post-joint block assessments, with a decrease in impulse counts post-block. For horses scoring 2/5 and 3/5 on the AEEP scale, Y-axis data also showed significant variation (p < 0.05), with impulse numbers increasing as lameness scores decreased. Z-axis data demonstrated low specificity. Overall, the mean X-axis impulse counts correlated strongly with subjective lameness scores (p ≤ 0.006 for significant correlations). Conclusion: The Lameness Detector 0.1 provides a reliable and cost-effective means to complement subjective gait analysis. The quantitative data, particularly X-axis impulses, correlate well with traditional lameness scores, suggesting potential value in integrating this device for enhanced diagnostic precision in equine lameness assessment.

ABSTRACT: Changes in genetic variation in body measurements are a subject of interest. This study aimed to understand the changes in the genetic effects of body measurement at birth in Turkish Arabian foals over the years. Furthermore, estimating the sources of variation in body measurements at birth in Turkish Arabian foals, considering additive genetic, maternal genetic, and maternal permanent effects and the covariance between offspring and dams in animal models, was the objective of this study. The records for birth weight (BW), wither height (WH), chest circumference (CC), and cannon-bone circumference (CBC) of 2624 Arabian foals born between 1987 and 2007 in the Anadolu, Karacabey, and Sultansuyu agricultural enterprises were used in the analyses. Variance analysis for non-genetic effects showed that the effects of the farm, year of birth, sex, and dam age were significant (P<0.001) for all traits. Estimation of variance components and genetic parameters for body measurements was performed with the average information restricted maximum likelihood algorithm using six univariate animal models in the WOMBAT software. The best-fit model for each trait was identified based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Genetic trends were determined by performing linear regression analysis on the estimated breeding value (EBV) of the animals based on their year of birth. Additive direct heritabilities for BW, WH, CC, and CBC were 0.10 ± 0.04, 0.41 ± 0.07, 0.06 ± 0.03, and 0.30 ± 0.07, respectively. The estimates of maternal heritability for the corresponding traits were 0.24 ± 0.03, 0.05 ± 0.03, 0.09 ± 0.03, and 0.13 ± 0.03, respectively. Additive-maternal genetic correlations for BW, WH, CC, and CBC were 0.33, -0.13, -0.19, and -0.22, respectively. Genetic and phenotypic correlations were analyzed with multivariate animal models considering additive genetic, maternal genetic, and maternal permanent effects and ranged from 0.340 to 0.924. The low to moderate direct and maternal heritabilities with additive-maternal genetic correlations showed that the variation in morphometric traits in foals could be affected by these factors and needs to be considered. Genetic trends showed increased weight and chest circumference in foals at birth. Based on these findings, breeders may consider these traits when selecting horses in future breeding programs.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate sedation and IV xylazine requirements to achieve 45% of baseline head height above ground measurements following oral (PO) administration of 2 trazodone dosages. METHODS 8 healthy, adult mares of various weights and breeds belonging to a university teaching herd were utilized in a blinded, crossover study design. Horses were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 PO treatments: control (no trazodone), trazodone at 3 mg/kg (low dose [LD]), or trazodone at 6 mg/kg (high dose [HD]). Before treatment, cardiac auscultation, EquiSed sedation score, and head height above ground (HHAG; cm) measurements were performed (baseline) followed by feeding of the treatment mixture. After 120 minutes, sedation score and HHAG were recorded. Xylazine was administered IV (0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.1 mg/kg/min) until HHAG reached 45% of baseline or a total dose of 1 mg/kg was reached. Individual data for xylazine dosage, sedation scores, and HHAG were analyzed using mixed linear models with repeated measures. RESULTS Sedation scores were significantly improved (LD, P = .045; HD, P = .01) and HHAG was lowered (LD, P = .045; HD, P = .09) by trazodone administration. Xylazine dose requirements were increased by LD trazodone administration (increase of 0.26 ± 0.26 mg/kg; P = .03) and unchanged by HD (increase of 0.13 ± 0.25 mg/kg; P = .38). CONCLUSIONS Oral trazodone administration increases quantifiable sedation in horses. Xylazine requirements are significantly increased by LD trazodone administration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Oral administration of LD trazodone may increase xylazine requirements. Further clinical studies are required to fully assess the clinical relevance of this finding on other parameters such as cardiovascular physiology. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: Lameness examinations are commonly performed in equine medicine. Advancements in digital technology have increased the use of video recordings for lameness assessment, however, standardization of ideal video angle is not available yielding videos of poor diagnostic quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of video angle on the subjective assessment of front limb lameness. A randomized, blinded, crossover study was performed. Six horses with and without mechanically induced forelimb solar pain were recorded using 9 video angles including horses trotting directly away and towards the video camera, horses trotting away and towards a video camera placed to the left and right side of midline, and horses trotting in a circle with the video camera placed on the inside and outside of the circle. Videos were randomized and assessed by three expert equine veterinarians using a 0–5 point scoring system. Objective lameness parameters were collected using a body-mounted inertial sensor system (Lameness Locator®, Equinosis LLC). Interobserver agreement for subjective lameness scores and ease of grading scores were determined. Results: Induction of lameness was successful in all horses. There was excellent agreement between objective lameness parameters and subjective lameness scores (AUC of the ROC = 0.87). For horses in the “lame” trials, interobserver agreement was moderate for video angle 2 when degree of lameness was considered and perfect for video angle 2 and 9 when lameness was considered as a binary outcome. All other angles had no to fair agreement. For horses in the “sound” trials, interobserver agreement was perfect for video angle 5. All other video angles had slight to moderate agreement. Conclusions: When video assessment of forelimb lameness is required, a video of the horse trotting directly towards the video camera at a minimum is recommended. Other video angles may provide supportive information regarding lameness characteristics. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Radiological observations at the cervicothoracic junction in horses with or without related clinical signs have not been comprehensively described. The aim was to evaluate the seventh cervical (C7) to second thoracic (T2) vertebrae in horses with neck-related clinical signs (neck pain and/or stiffness, neck-related forelimb lameness, or general proprioceptive [spinal] ataxia) and control horses. This prospective analytical cross-sectional study included 127 control horses and 96 cases, examined using standardized clinical and radiological protocols. Univariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to identify factors associated with radiological abnormalities. Severe modeling of the articular processes at C7–T1 was more likely in cases compared with controls, OR, 4.25; CI, 1.04–17.36; P =.04. Cases were more likely to have spondylolisthesis at C7–T1 than controls, OR, 3.61; CI, 1.75–7.44; P <.001. There was a lack of uniformity of disc space width at C6–C7, despite normal alignment of the vertebrae, in five (5.2%) cases and no control horses. Discospondylosis was seen in 9 (9.4%) horses at C7–T1 and 10 of 64 (15.6%) at T1–T2. The sagittal ratio for T1 was smaller for horses with neck-related forelimb lameness (P <.0002), neck pain/ stiffness (P =.04), or neurological cases (P <.001) than controls. The prevalence of radiological abnormalities at C7–T1 and T1–T2 highlights the importance of careful evaluation of the cervicothoracic junction in horses with neck-related signs. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: The translocation of gingival commensals resulting in measurable systemic inflammation has been described in humans and non-equine veterinary species with dental disorders, particularly periodontal disease. Routine odontoplasty does not result in increased serum amyloid A (SAA) concentration in horses, but a measurable increase in SAA concentration in horses undergoing dental extractions could suggest that local inflammation resulting from more severe dental disease has potential for wider, systemic consequences that warrants further study. Objectives: To determine whether SAA increases in horses undergoing simple, oral extraction of non-fractured cheek teeth with and without periodontal disease. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: SAA was measured using a stall-side test in horses undergoing simple oral extraction of cheek teeth with intact clinical crowns at baseline (T = 0), 24 h (T = 24) and 48 h (T = 48) post-extraction. Results: Eight horses and 4 ponies aged between 4 and 23 years underwent cheek tooth extraction. A statistically significant difference in SAA concentration was noted between groups with and without periodontal disease at both 24 h (p = 0.004) and 48 h (p = 0.043). At 24 h, the median SAA concentration was 135 mg/L (range: 0–260 mg/L; IQR: 77.5–174 mg/L) in horses with periodontal disease and 27.5 mg/L (range: 0–47 mg/L; IQR: 4.8–43.5 mg/L) in horses without periodontal disease. At 48 h, median SAA concentration was 264 mg/L (range: 236–440 mg/L; IQR: 245.5–300.5 mg/L) in horses with periodontal disease and 0 mg/L (range = 0–41 mg/L; IQR: 0–21.8 mg/L) in horses without periodontal disease. Main Limitations: Small sample group. Horses undergoing extraction of fractured cheek teeth were not included. Conclusions: Extraction of non-fractured cheek teeth does not result in a remarkable increase in SAA, except in horses with periodontal disease. These results suggest that periodontal disease in horses is associated with a local inflammatory response, which in turn drives the development of systemic inflammation, resulting in detectable increases in inflammatory markers when diseased periodontal tissues are disturbed. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Trust is an essential component of the relationship between veterinarians and horse owners. To what extent do horse owners consider their vets to be trustworthy, what aspects are important to horse owners when evaluating their vet's trustworthiness and how can equine vets become more trusted?. Methods: Using an anonymous online survey, we asked horse owners whether they consider their veterinarians to be credible, reliable, empathetic and self-orientated, and therefore trustworthy compared with other professionals. Which of their equine vet's characteristics and behaviours influence how credible, reliable, empathetic and self-orientated, and therefore trustworthy, they appear? Credibility, reliability, empathy and self-orientation scores for equine veterinarians, human medical general practitioners (GPs), hairdressers/barbers and dentists were compared using a Kruskal‒Wallis H-test and post hoc Dunn's test and then combined to create a trustworthiness rating. The importance of various characteristics and behaviours displayed by equine vets when horse owners assess how credible, reliable, empathetic and self-orientated they appear was investigated using quantitative scoring and thematic analysis. Results: A total of 415 horse owners completed the survey. Overall, respondents considered equine veterinarians to be significantly more credible, reliable and empathetic than GPs, hairdressers/barbers and dentists. Using the trust equation, equine veterinarians had the highest trustworthiness rating (8.33), followed by hairdressers/barbers and dentists (5.5) and then GPs (4.75). Limitations: Only the views of a small subset of horse owners are represented. As such, the findings may not be representative of horse owners more generally. Conclusions: Veterinarians' communication skills influence clients' perceptions of their credibility, reliability, empathy and self-orientation. Additionally, equine veterinarians should develop their clinical skills and knowledge to increase credibility. Meanwhile, perceptions of reliability, empathy and self-orientation can be improved by continuity of care, demonstrating a clear interest in the patient and avoiding rushed consultations, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Studies on equine air transport practices and consequences are scarce. This prospective study aimed to describe horse and air journey details and practices, document how horse behavior and health changed during the air transport phases, quantify the occurrence of welfare issues, and identify possible associations between horse and journey details, air transport practices, and welfare issues. Results: Data were collected from before departure to five days after arrival on 118/597 horses traveling on 32 commercial air journeys on different routes, varying in duration and conditions. Most horses were middle-aged warmblood females, 26% of which were pregnant, and being moved by air for sales. Before flying, most were quarantined (median: 18; IQR: 9–53 days), and their fitness for travel was certified by veterinarians. At the departure airports, external temperatures varied from − 6 °C to 33 °C, and horses were loaded by experienced flight grooms (median: 35; IQR: 15–40 years) into jet stalls (three-horse: 87%, two-horse: 13%). During the flights, horses were regularly watered (water intake median: 14 L) and fed ad libitum (feed consumption median: 8 kg). At the arrival airport, horses were unloaded from the jet stalls, and external temperatures ranged from − 5 °C to 32 °C. Then, all horses were transported to arrival quarantine by road. Air transport phases affected horses’ health status and behavior; increased heart and respiratory rates and behaviors, such as pawing, head tossing, and vocalization, were mainly identified at departure and arrival. Horse interaction, nasal discharge, increased capillary refill time (CRT), and abnormal demeanor were observed more often one hour before landing while resting and normal capillary refill time were more often displayed five days after arrival (all P < 0.01). One hour before landing, horses with bad temperament and horses of unknown temperament were more likely to develop nasal discharge when transported in winter and autumn (P < 0.001). The likelihood of an increased CRT was associated with shorter flights in horses of unknown travel experience (P < 0.001). Ten horses were injured, and 11 developed pleuropneumonias (i.e., shipping fever). Conclusions: Air transport is a complex procedure with several different phases affecting horse health and behavior. Therefore, experienced staff should carefully manage each horse before, during, and after air journeys to minimize welfare hazards. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The article presents a set of horse skeletons (11 individuals) found at three excavation sites south of the city of Brno (Czech Republic), dated to the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods. The skeletons were deliberately deposited within agricultural estates and the assemblage consisted of complete or near-complete skeletons. The osteological assemblage was therefore suitable for further analysis. Firstly, the withers height and robusticity of individual equines were determined. The majority of them were slightly taller and more slender-legged than those of earlier periods and smaller than contemporary riding and draft horses. With one exception, they were determined to be males and majority died at around 7-14 years of age. Pathological findings observed on the skull and second premolars can be most likely related to the working history of those individuals. Changes to the spinal column are in most cases rather mild or absent suggesting that the horses studied were probably not used for extensive heavy work. The relatively high incidence of other pathological changes indicates poor health care, with two individuals showing signs of a possible bacterial infection. The origin and mobility of the individuals were reconstructed by strontium analyses. With one exception, all individuals were most likely born and died in the same region. © 2024 L'Homme et l'Animal, Societe de Recherche Interdisciplinaire (HASRI). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Interest in Equine assisted services (EAS) has grown over the past two decades, with research highlighting the benefits for participants in ridden, or mounted services. However, there is a notable lack of studies focusing on the welfare of the horses involved in these services. As research in this area continues to develop, a review is necessary to evaluate the quality of existing studies about the welfare of horses in the EAS industry. Systematic reviews provide a structured approach to organizing current literature and identifying gaps in the research. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize the existing literature on the stress and welfare of horses in EAS and pinpoint areas requiring further investigation. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, five databases were searched using terms relevant to EAS. Of the search result, 28 papers met the criteria for inclusion, requiring research to be published in English, in a peer-reviewed journal, studying EAS and its effects on equine welfare. Of the 28, 24 articles focused on quantitative data, including behavioral and physiological indicators of stress and welfare. The remaining 4 articles were survey and EAS module analysis, providing qualitative data about EAS horses. From the selected papers, we found the following trends related to EAS horse stress indicators. First, 20 (71.4 %) papers investigated physiological indicators, and 16 (57.1 %) investigated behavioral indicators. The sample size in 16 (57.1 %) articles was ten or fewer animals. The results in 17 (60.7 %) of the articles found that there was no significant difference in horses' stress or that no conclusions could be drawn regarding the horses’ stress and welfare. A survey conducted by Rankins et al. (2021) revealed that the most common problems EAS centers face are behavioral and soundness issues leading to high horse turnover. Despite these findings, many studies found a lack of significant differences in their results, likely due to limitations in study design, highlighting significant gaps in the research. We also identified several inconsistent factors that are likely to affect and confound the results of EAS research. Therefore, given the limited knowledge about the welfare of horses working in EAS and the confounding factors that are likely to influence the results of studies, more robust research is needed to better understand the challenges of horses working in EAS and their welfare. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: An 18-y-old American Saddlebred mare was admitted with fever and acute onset of neurologic signs including grade 3 of 5 ataxia, difficulty in prehension, and dull mentation. Because of financial restraints, desired testing could not be performed; the horse’s condition declined despite supportive treatment, and euthanasia was elected. Postmortem examination revealed petechiae and ecchymoses in the meninges and neuroparenchyma of the encephalon. Blast-like neoplastic round cells were identified within the vasculature and areas of hemorrhage in the neuroparenchyma, the intestinal submucosa, and other organs, including the liver, kidney, lung, and mesenteric lymph node. Necrotizing enterocolitis and acute fibrinonecrotizing bacterial pneumonia were also noted. Of the atypical round cells in the encephalon, >70% expressed ionized calcium–binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), 10–20% expressed myeloperoxidase (MPO), and <10% expressed PAX5, CD3, CD20, CD79a, or MUM1. The bone marrow was diffusely effaced by neoplastic round cells expressing Iba1, and ~70% of these cells expressed MPO with no expression of CD3 or CD20. CD172a also immunolabeled a portion of the neoplastic cells. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia-M1 with an unusual neurologic presentation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Aims. We aim to detect beta-lactamase-producing Citrobacter sedlakii from horses and compare the genomic characteristics with isolates from humans. Methods and result. We characterized phenotypically and genotypically nine C. sedlakii isolates from the feces of horses and then compared them to human-derived isolates using whole genome sequencing and phylogenomic methods. Seven isolates (7/9) were ampicillin-resistant, while at least one isolate was resistant to ceftriaxone, gentamicin, meropenem, and streptomycin. All nine isolates were carriers of the chromosomal-mediated blaSED-1  beta-lactamase gene, which confers resistance to ampicillin. One isolate was positive for the mcr-9 gene that confers resistance to colistin, and another isolate had the aac(6′)-lid gene that confers resistance to aminoglycosides. Seven isolates (7/9) were carriers of genes that confer metal resistance to copper, silver, and arsenic. Phylogenetically, two horse-derived isolates clustered together with two human-derived isolates from the NDARO database. Conclusion. The results from our study provide insight into the antimicrobial susceptibility of C. sedlakii in horses, which was previously lacking, and the specific beta-lactamase gene mediating resistance. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Quality of life (QoL) provides a comprehensive concept underpinning veterinary decision-making that encompasses factors beyond physical health. It becomes particularly pertinent when seeking responsible choices for chronically ill or old horses that emphasise their well-being and a good QoL over the extension of life. How different stakeholders use the concept of QoL is highly relevant when considering the complexity of these decisions in real-life situations. Methods: Seven focus group discussions (N = 39) were conducted to gain insights into how stakeholders assess and use equine QoL in veterinary care decisions for chronically ill and/or old horses. The discussions included horse owners (n = 17), equine veterinarians (n = 7), veterinary officers (n = 6), farriers (n = 4), and horse caregivers (n = 5). The combination of deductive and inductive qualitative content analysis of the group discussions focused on identifying both similarities and differences in the views of these groups regarding QoL for old and/or chronically ill horses. Results: Findings show agreement about two issues: the importance of the individuality of the horse for assessing QoL and the relevance of QoL in making decisions about veterinary interventions. We identified differences between the groups with respect to three issues: the time required to assess QoL, stakeholders’ contributions to QoL assessments, and challenges resulting from those contributions. While owners and caregivers of horses emphasised their knowledge of a horse and the relevance of the time they spend with their horse, the veterinarians in the study focused on the differences between their own QoL assessments and those of horse owners. In response to challenges regarding QoL assessments and decision-making, stakeholders described different strategies such as drawing comparisons to human experiences. Conclusions: Differences between stakeholders regarding equine QoL assessments contribute to challenges when making decisions about the care of chronically ill or old horses. The results of this study suggest that individual and collaborative reflection about a horse’s QoL should be encouraged, for example by developing practicable QoL assessment tools that support relevant stakeholders in this process. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Semi-feral, free-roaming Konik polski horses are used in some European countries for preserving semi-open pasture landscapes. The estimation of their health status is still li-mited by insufficient data on various blood parameters. Therefore, our study aimed at the sex-and age-dependent analysis of haemogram and selected biochemistry parameters in healthy, semi-feral Koniks. In order to reach this aim, we took blood samples from 53 female and 18 male (8 un-castrated, 10 castrated) Koniks living in two Middle German nature reserves. They were of different age (9–266 months) and without signs of illness. Blood samples were analysed by an accredited laboratory. We identified age-but not sex-dependent changes in the white blood cell count (WBC). Higher age mainly caused a decrease in lymphocytes. Therefore, WBC correlated ne-gatively and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio positively with increasing age. Serum values of selected biochemical parameters did not depend on age but showed some sex-re-lated differences. In this regard, serum total protein, trigly-ceride and the enzymatic activities of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase and g-glutamyltransferase were higher in males than females. However, the sex dependency of these enzymatic activities was restricted to uncastrated ma-les. They also showed higher serum values for calcium and selenium than castrated males or all females. As far as the respective group sizes permitted, we then calculated age-or sex-dependent reference interval values for all parameters analysed. These values improve now the estimation of the health status of semi-feral, free-roaming Konik horses and provide a stable basis for future studies. © GST | SVS.

ABSTRACT: Feedstuffs, especially ensiled forage, may be detrimental to equid oral health by exposing the oral cavity to low pH. This study aimed to identify if salivary pH was altered by 1) a range of different feedstuffs and (2) specifically by feeding haylages with differing nutrient profiles. Two studies were conducted. The first measured oral pH following five feedstuffs, (hay, haylage, unmolassed sugarbeet pulp, unmolassed alfalfa chaff and rolled oats), tested individually over five days. Saliva (≥1 ml) was collected in triplicate, prior to feeding, directly after ingesting 500 g of each feedstuff, then 15 min and 30 min post-prandially. Oral pH was determined (pH meter) within 10 min of collection. In study two, eight ponies, were fed as their total diet, four different haylages over four 15-day periods. Saliva was collected, prior to feeding and immediately after ingesting 500 g of forage on day 1, day 6, and day 12 of each period. Samples were collected and analysed as per study one. All data were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA, and in study two linear regression was used to attempt to predict nutrients that influenced oral pH. All statistics were conducted in Genstat 20 th Ed. Only feeding unmolassed sugarbeet caused a reduction (p<0.001) in oral pH. There were differences in oral pH depending on the type of haylage fed in study two but at all times oral pH post-feeding was the same or greater than basal pH. These studies suggest any feed associated modulation of oral pH in horses may only be short-lived and quickly buffered by saliva. However, these studies only reflect oral pH within the oral cavity around the feeding occasion and may not reflect gingival pH or the effects of different feeds over longer time periods. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Using metagenomic sequencing we identified equine rotavirus group B (ERVB) of ruminant origin in foal diarrhea outbreaks in the 2021 foaling season. To further investigate ERVB occurrence and determine its environmental stability, we collected mare and foal fecal samples from different farms in Central Kentucky during the 2022 foaling season. The RT-qPCR-based analyses showed that ERVB genome was detected in 16.67 % (42/252) of surveyed mare samples and 26.56 % (34/128) of foal samples. Furthermore, 94.12 % (16/17) of collected soil samples and 100 % (13/13) of water samples obtained from the ERVB-positive farm premises also tested weakly positive. In addition, ERVB genome fragments were detected in 58.33 % (7/12) of indoor samples collected from the equipment/barn/hospital wards during the outbreak period. Finally, the seroprevalence study showed 87 % (113/130) of surveyed horse serum samples were positive for ERVB antibodies. Despite unsuccessful attempts in ERVB cultivation, phylogenetic analyses showed that fecal ERVB strains representing 2022 and 2023 foal diarrhea outbreaks, like 2021 strains, were more closely related to ruminant rotavirus B than other viruses. Further sequence analyses revealed that none of the three viral capsid proteins, the primary targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, exhibited notable mutations among ERVB strains circulated over the past three years. Our data demonstrated that ERVB was widespread in horses on affected farms with extreme stability in the farm environment. These findings continue to support the need for future surveillance of ERVB in horses and the surrounding environment, and the development of effective countermeasures to protect horses against this new viral disease. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The present study involved seven horses in a randomized crossover clinical trial to evaluate the effect of lidocaine on horses with induced endotoxemia. Horses received intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg bolus, followed by 0.05 mg/kg bwt/min) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride at the same manner) one hour before LPS administration (0.03 μg/kg, IV infusion over 30 min). We monitored clinic and hematologic parameters, abdominal auscultation, ultrasound, and pain over time. No relevant clinical differences existed between treatments regarding peristalsis, abdominal pain, or any other parameters before and after endotoxemia induction. These findings do not support the clinical use of lidocaine to mitigate abdominal pain and intestinal hypomotility promoted by endotoxemia in horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Since the passage of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, federal agencies have been responsible for managing free-roaming equids in the United States. Over the last 20 years, management has been hampered by direct opposition from advocacy groups, budget limitations, and a decline in the public's willingness to adopt free-roaming horses (Equus caballus). As a result, free-roaming equid numbers have increased to >3 times the targeted goal of 26,785 (horses and burros [E. asinus] combined), the cumulative sum of the appropriate management levels (AML) for all 177 designated herd management areas (HMA) managed by the Bureau of Land Management. This increase is one of the causes of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) population declines, owing to habitat alteration from free-roaming equids exacerbated by ongoing drought. To evaluate potential demographic mechanisms influencing these declines, we compiled survival data from 4 studies in central Wyoming, USA, including 995 adult female (first-year breeders or older) sage-grouse during the breeding season, 1,075 nests, 372 broods, and 136 juveniles (i.e., overwinter survival for fledged young), from 2008–2022. During this period, we also obtained population information for free-roaming horses from 9 HMAs used by individual grouse in our sample. Population estimates of free-roaming horses for these HMAs ranged from 59% to 7 times of the maximum appropriate management level (AMLmax). Sage-grouse monitored outside of HMAs represented control populations and, because we assumed they were not exposed to populations of free-roaming horses, we set values of AMLmax to zero for all grouse located outside of HMAs. To evaluate whether free-roaming horses were negatively affecting sage-grouse, we modeled daily survival of breeding age females, nest, broods, and juveniles. There was strong or moderate evidence that overabundant free-roaming horses negatively affected nest, brood, and juvenile survival. When horse abundance increased from AMLmax to 3 times AMLmax, survival was reduced 8.1%, 18.3%, 18.2%, and 18.2% for nests, early broods (≤20 days after hatch), late broods (>20 days to 35 days after hatch), and juveniles, respectively. These results indicate increasing free-roaming horse numbers affected vital rates for important life stages of sage-grouse, and that maintaining free-roaming horse numbers below AMLmax would reduce negative effects to sage-grouse populations. © 2024 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a fatal zoonosis caused by ticks in East Asia. As SFTS virus (SFTSV) is maintained between wildlife and ticks, seroepidemiological studies in wildlife are important to understand the behavior of SFTSV in the environment. Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, is an SFTS-endemic area, and approximately 100 feral horses, called Misaki horses (Equus caballus), inhabit Cape Toi in Miyazaki Prefecture. While these animals are managed in a wild-like manner, their ages are ascertainable due to individual identification. In the present study, we conducted a seroepidemiological survey of SFTSV in Misaki horses between 2015 and 2023. This study aimed to understand SFTSV infection in horses and its transmission to wildlife. A total of 707 samples from 180 feral horses were used to determine the seroprevalence of SFTSV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutralization testing was performed on 118 samples. In addition, SFTS viral RNA was detected in ticks from Cape Toi and feral horses. The overall seroprevalence between 2015 and 2023 was 78.5% (555/707). The lowest seroprevalence was 55% (44/80) in 2016 and the highest was 92% (76/83) in 2018. Seroprevalence was significantly affected by age, with 11% (8/71) in those less than one year of age and 96.7% (435/450) in those four years of age and older (p < 0.0001). The concordance between ELISA and neutralization test results was 88.9% (105/118). SFTS viral RNA was not detected in ticks (n = 516) or feral horses. This study demonstrated that horses can be infected with SFTSV and that age is a significant factor in seroprevalence in wildlife. This study provides insights into SFTSV infection not only in horses but also in wildlife in SFTS-endemic areas. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Inflammatory myopathy and perivasculitis have been recently described in horses with chronic equine piroplasmosis (EP). These alterations may be linked to poor performances. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence for EP in clinically healthy Italian Standardbred (IS) racehorses and to compare laboratory parameters and performance metrics between positive and negative horses. Real-time PCR was applied for the detection of T. equi and B. caballi positivity. Haematology parameters, blood chemistry results, subjective muscle mass scores, and performance metrics were compared between PCR-positive and -negative horses. Results: This cross-sectional study included 120 well-trained IS racehorses and was performed over a two-years period. The prevalence of T. equi was 36.3%, whereas all samples were negative for B. caballi. Red blood cells count, haemoglobin concentration, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities were significantly higher in PCR-positive horses, whereas blood urea nitrogen, globulin concentration and globulin-to-albumin ratio were significantly lower in PCR-positive horses compared to PCR-negative ones. Nonetheless, all values fell within the physiological range. The best racing time, which was selected as the most representative of the performance metrics at the principal component analysis, was not affected by PCR positivity, the muscle mass score or the training yard. The best racing time was significantly better in horses with a mild or no signs of muscular atrophy, within the PCR-positive group. The muscle mass score was associated with the training yard in PCR-negative horses. Conclusions: Prevalence of T. equi was high in IS racehorses in southern Italy. The absence of obvious changes in haematological and biochemical parameters, as well as performance metrics in positive horses, highlights the need for specific diagnostic tests to identify chronically infected horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Coagulopathy is common in equine critical illness, with its early recognition being crucial for patient management and prognosis. In vitro viscoelastic (VE) hypercoagulability with decreased RCM/PCV has been demonstrated in dogs but not horses. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of acepromazine-induced (0.1 mg/kg IV) decreased RCM on VE and plasma coagulation parameters using a prospective interventional study of eight adult horses. Complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), and VCM Vet™ VE testing performed at baseline (T0), 1 h (T1), and 12 h (T2) post acepromazine administration. Splenic volume was determined ultrasonographically. The results were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc HSD test to determine the effect of time (sample). PCV decreased 13% points following acepromazine administration from T0 to T1 (p < 0.001), remaining decreased at T2 (p < 0.001). Splenic volume increased from T0 to T1 (p = 0.04) and was not different from baseline at T2. Maximal clot formation (MCF) increased from T0 (p = 0.03). PTT decreased from T0 to T1 and increased at T2 (p = 0.03). No other coagulation parameters were significantly altered. This study demonstrates a non-inflammatory acute model of anemia in horses that impacts VE and plasma-based testing. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical diagnosis, ultrasound findings, and outcome of 11 endurance horses with injuries to the serratus ventralis thoracis (SVT) or serratus ventralis cervicis (SVC) muscle. ANIMALS 11 endurance horses competing in medium- to high-level competitions and presenting with lameness caused by injuries to the SVT or SVC muscle, as confirmed by ultrasonography. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Physical examinations revealed swelling caudal to the shoulder region associated with dorsocranial displacement of the scapula and edema of the ventral thorax for horses with SVT injuries. Swelling cranial to the scapula and edema of the pectoral area were identified among horses with injuries to the SVC. RESULTS Dynamic examinations revealed moderate-to-severe reduction of the cranial phase of the stride at the walk; at the trot, a lameness score of 2 to 3/5 was assigned (modified American Association of Equine Practitioners Lameness Scale). Ultrasonography revealed moderate-to-severe increases in size of the muscle body, heterogeneous echogenicity, loss of the striated muscle pattern, and varying degrees of perimuscular edema. All horses were able to resume full training and competition in an average of 216 days (range, 74 to 362 days) and 148 days (range, 112 to 309 days) for injuries of the SVT and SVC, respectively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This case series is the first to describe the clinical and ultrasonographic features of spontaneous injuries to the SVT or SVC. Ultrasonography for diagnosis was simple and well tolerated by the horses. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar abortus equi (S. abortus equi) is one of the main pathogens that causes abortion in pregnant horses and donkeys, which was highly infectious and greatly restricts the healthy development of the horse industry. Objectives: In order to investigate the prevalence and biological characteristics of S. abortus equi in different regions and breeds of horses in Xinjiang. Methods: This study conducted ELISA detection of S. abortus equi antibodies on serum samples of 971 horses collected from three large-scale horse farms and five free-range horse farms in Yili Prefecture and Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang from 2020 to 2023. On this basis, bacterial isolation, culture, identification, and drug sensitivity tests were conducted on 42 samples of aborted foal tissues and 23 mare vaginal swabs. Results: The results showed that the positive rate of S. abortus equi antibody was as high as 20.91% in 971 horse serum samples. Among them, the positive rate in the Ili region (29.09%) was significantly higher than that in the Bayingole region (11.24%), and the positive rate in mares (22.45%) was higher than that in stallions (14.05%). In terms of horse breeds, the positive rates of self-propagating thoroughbred horses, half-bred horses, Ili horses and Yanqi horses were 43.22%, 28.81%, 14.72% and 11.24% respectively. In addition, S. abortus equi was more susceptible to juvenile and elderly horses, with positive rates of 70.00%and 41.86%, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than young (10.97%) and adult (19.79%) horses. Further, 9 strains of S. abortus equi were obtained through bacterial isolation, culture and identification, which were resistant to five antibiotics (Clarithromycin, Clindamycin, penicillin, Sulfamethoxazole and Rifampicin), and sensitive to 13 antimicrobial agents (Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin, et al.). Conclusion: There was a high infection rate of S. abortus equi in Ili Prefecture and self-propagating thoroughbred horses, and juvenile or old mares were more susceptible, which will provide scientific basis for the prevention of S. abortus equi infection in different regions and breeds of horses in Xinjiang. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine whether horses exhibiting unilateral hindlimb lameness unload (rest) the lame limb more than the contralateral limb. The resting/unloading of the hindlimbs and the time spent lying down were measured using accelerometers. Ten non-lame horses and 20 lame horses were recruited for participation and monitored for 11 h overnight with accelerometers (MSR145, sampling rate: 1 Hz, and measuring range: ±15 g) attached to the lateral metatarsal and metacarpal regions of each limb. Metatarsal and metacarpal orientation were used to determine whether the limb was unloaded (rested) or loaded, respectively, or whether the horses were lying down. The relation of resting time between non-lame and lame limbs (non-lame/lame: 0.85 ± 1.2) of the lame horses differed significantly (p = 0.035) from that of the non-lame horses (right/left: 1.08 ± 0.47). Non-lame horses rested their hindlimbs evenly (left: 15 ± 10%; right: 17 ± 16%). Horses with unilateral hindlimb lameness unloaded the lame limb longer (lame limb: 61.8 ± 25.3%, non-lame limb: 38.2 ± 25.3%) than their contralateral limb. The lame horses (13 ± 11%) lay down longer (p = 0.012) than the non-lame horses (3 ± 6%). The degree of lameness determined by the participating veterinarians (Vet Score) (r = −0.691, p < 0.01) and the asymmetry evaluated by the lameness locator (ALL) (r = −0.426, p = 0.019) correlated with the resting ratio (rest time ratio). Both factors were also correlated with the time spent lying down (Vet Score (r = 0.364, p = 0.048) and the ALL (r = 0.398, p = 0.03)). The ALL and VET Score were significantly correlated (r = 0.557, p = 0.01). The results of this study provide a good baseline for future research into how individual resting patterns may help to detect pain. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Reversing the hepatic inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment caused by gut microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS), accumulating to the liver through the gut-liver axis, is crucial for suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastasis. However, synergistically manipulating LPS-induced inflammation and gut microbiota remains a daunting task. Herein, a Trojan-horse strategy is proposed using an oral dextran-carbenoxolone (DEX-CBX) conjugate, which combines prebiotic and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) homologs, to targeted delivery GA to HCC through the gut-liver axis for simultaneous modulation of hepatic inflammation and gut microbiota. In the orthotopic HCC model, a 95–45% reduction in the relative abundances of LPS-associated microbiota is observed, especially Helicobacter, caused by DEX-CBX treatment over phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment. Notably, a dramatic increase (37-fold over PBS) in the abundance of Akkermansia, which is known to strengthen systemic immune response, is detected. Furthermore, DEX-CBX significantly increased natural killer T cells (5.7-fold) and CD8+ T cells (3.9-fold) as well as decreased M2 macrophages (59% reduction) over PBS treatment, resulting in a tumor suppression rate of 85.4%. DEX-CBX is anticipated to offer a novel strategy to precisely modulate hepatic inflammation and the gut microbiota to address both the symptoms and root causes of LPS-induced immunosuppression in HCC. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: An emotion is defined as the affective response to a stimulus that leads to specific bodily changes, enabling individuals to react to positive or negative environmental conditions. In the absence of speech, emotions in animals are primarily studied by observing expressive components, such as facial expressions. This review aims to analyze the available literature on the influence of environmental stimuli on measurable behaviors in horses, describing the anatomical components involved in perception at the central nervous system level and the efferent pathways that trigger facial muscle contraction or relaxation, thus altering facial expressions. Additionally, articles addressing the function of facial expressions in communication are discussed, emphasizing their role in social interactions in this species. While there is limited research on equine neurophysiology, considering the common structure of the limbic system in most mammals, studies conducted on canines and primates were taken into account. In conclusion, the article underscores the importance of understanding equine facial expressions to assess their emotional states and, by extension, their welfare. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Evaluate the incidence of Borrelia burgdorferi in cases of equine nuchal bursitis (NB) and investigate the relationship between elevated serum outer surface protein A (OspA) antibodies and the molecular identification of B burgdorferi in bursal tissue or synovial fluid. Additionally, describe clinical cases and compare the histologic changes in NB with and without detection of B burgdorferi. METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study (2013 to 2022). Medical records from horses with a diagnosis of NB and B burgdorferi PCR testing on NB tissue or synovial fluid were reviewed. The study population included 11 horses with a postmortem diagnosis of NB, 19 horses from the northeastern US with an antemortem diagnosis of B burgdorferi PCR–positive NB, and 15 healthy controls without evidence of NB and unvaccinated for B burgdorferi. Where serum was available, Lyme multiplex assay results were compared with controls and ELISAs targeting individual B burgdorferi antigens were performed. Histologic findings in nuchal bursa tissue were compared between NB cases with and without B burgdorferi PCR detection. RESULTS Serum OspA antibody values in B burgdorferi–positive NB cases (n = 13) were significantly elevated (P < .001) compared to controls (15), and OspA was the predominant antigen detected by ELISA (8). Histopathology did not vary between NB cases with (n = 9) and without (6) B burgdorferi PCR detection. CONCLUSIONS The presence of B burgdorferi in the nuchal bursa of horses is associated with increased serum OspA antibodies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The role of B burgdorferi in equine NB may be underestimated, and targeted therapy requires investigation. ©The authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The Icelandic horse and Exmoor pony are ancient, native breeds, adapted to harsh environmental conditions and they have both undergone severe historic bottlenecks. However, in modern days, the selection pressures on these breeds differ substantially. The aim of this study was to assess genetic diversity in both breeds through expected (HE) and observed heterozygosity (HO) and effective population size (Ne). Furthermore, we aimed to identify runs of homozygosity (ROH) to estimate and compare genomic inbreeding and signatures of selection in the breeds. Results: HO was estimated at 0.34 and 0.33 in the Icelandic horse and Exmoor pony, respectively, aligning closely with HE of 0.34 for both breeds. Based on genomic data, the Ne for the last generation was calculated to be 125 individuals for Icelandic horses and 42 for Exmoor ponies. Genomic inbreeding coefficient (FROH) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20 for the Icelandic horse and 0.12 to 0.27 for the Exmoor pony, with the majority of inbreeding attributed to short ROHs in both breeds. Several ROH islands associated with performance were identified in the Icelandic horse, featuring target genes such as DMRT3, DOCK8, EDNRB, SLAIN1, and NEURL1. Shared ROH islands between both breeds were linked to metabolic processes (FOXO1), body size, and the immune system (CYRIB), while private ROH islands in Exmoor ponies were associated with coat colours (ASIP, TBX3, OCA2), immune system (LYG1, LYG2), and fertility (TEX14, SPO11, ADAM20). Conclusions: Evaluations of genetic diversity and inbreeding reveal insights into the evolutionary trajectories of both breeds, highlighting the consequences of population bottlenecks. While the genetic diversity in the Icelandic horse is acceptable, a critically low genetic diversity was estimated for the Exmoor pony, which requires further validation. Identified signatures of selection highlight the differences in the use of the two breeds as well as their adaptive trait similarities. The results provide insight into genomic regions under selection pressure in a gaited performance horse breed and various adaptive traits in small-sized native horse breeds. This understanding contributes to preserving genetic diversity and population health in these equine populations. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Recovery from general anaesthesia is risky in horses. Alpha2-agonist administration after anaesthesia enhances the quality of recovery but may prolong this phase. Recovery time and quality were investigated after medetomidine administration at the end of general anaesthesia in a prospective, randomised, masked and clinical study. Horses underwent medetomidine–isoflurane partial intravenous anaesthesia. Medetomidine (0.5 or 1 µg/kg) IV was administered just after isoflurane was discontinued. The duration of different recovery phases and the number of attempts were recorded. A composite scale (from 1—excellent to 6—accident) was used for quality assessment. Mann—Whitney U-test was performed (p < 0.05). Twenty-seven horses per group were included. Results for 0.5 and 1 µg/kg groups were as follows: lateral recumbency time: 35 (24–45) and 43 (35–55) minutes; sternal recumbency time: 6 (3–15) and 5 (2–15) minutes; total recovery time: 47 (40–59) and 49 (42–62) minutes; number of attempts to sternal: 1 (1–1) and 1 (1–2) and to standing: 1 (1–3) and 1 (1–2); and, quality: 2 (1–2) and 2 (1–2), respectively. No significant differences between the groups were found. Medetomidine 0.5 µg/kg dose did not decrease the recovery time but maintained the recovery quality. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Workload associated with the high frequency Colombian Paso Fino gait has not been evaluated. Objectives: To determine the oxygen consumption (V̇O2), heart rate (HR), stride frequency: breathing ratio, and hematology associated with the Paso Fino gait, including whether exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) occurs. Animals: Eleven Paso Fino horses. Methods: Prospective cohort study. Horses performed a standardized Paso Fino gait test across a wooden sounding board, simulating competition. V̇O2 and ventilatory parameters (tidal volume [VT]; peak inspiratory and expiratory airflows [PkV̇I, PkV̇E]; respiratory rate [RR], minute ventilation [V̇E]) were measured using a portable ergospirometry facemask. Heart rate was measured using electrocardiograms. Post-exercise lactate, hematocrit, bicarbonate, pH, electrolytes, and biochemistry concentrations were measured. EIPH was assessed via tracheobronchoscopy. Four horses completed a secondary high-intensity gallop to elicit peak V̇O2 for comparative purposes. Results: Median [IQR] mean individual HR during the Paso Fino gait was 190 [178, 201] bpm. Relative V̇O2 measured 49.8 [48.4, 59.5] mL/(kg min; VT = 8.6 [8.0, 10.7] L; RR = 87.1 [75.4, 99.5] bpm; V̇E = 869 [740, 902] L/min; PkV̇I = 33.4 [32.7, 37.2] L/s; PkV̇E = 44.2 [40.3, 46.0] L/s). Horses took 2.8 [2.7, 2.9] strides/second and had a stride frequency: breathing ratio of 2.0 [1.8, 2.3]. Post-exercise blood lactate concentration and hematocrit measured 2.7 mmol/L and 50% respectively. Three horses showed endoscopic evidence of Grade-1 EIPH. The Paso Fino gait V̇O2 and HR equaled 79% V̇O2pk and 91% maximal HR, respectively, based on the high-intensity gallop. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The Paso Fino gait represents submaximal exercise based on V̇O2 < V̇O2pk and blood lactate. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Understanding and finding the correlation between morphometric measurements and horse blood parameters is crucial for predicting equine metabolic issues. Objective: This study aims to analyse morphometric measurements and blood samples in horses with varying adiposity levels. Study design: Cross-sectional observational. Methods: A total of 50 horses were included in the study and categorized into groups based on their body condition score (BCS) and cresty neck score (CNS). Results: The insulin concentration was significantly higher in overweight horses (p = 0.022). Female horses exhibited higher cortisol concentrations (p = 0.025) and girth circumference at the withers (p = 0.004) compared to males. Lactating mares exhibited higher concentrations of serum total protein (p = 0.012) and globulin (p = 0.003). A positive correlation was observed between BCS and insulin concentrations (r = 0.290, p = 0.041). Negative correlations were found between neck circumference to height at withers and glucose (r = −0.309, p = 0.029), CNS and glucose (r = −0.315, p = 0.026) as well as between crest diameter and cortisol (r = −0.360, p = 0.01). Main limitations: Increasing the sample size and conducting longitudinal studies would enhance the study's validity and reliability. Conclusion: Although insulin, glucose and cortisol concentrations have predictive capabilities based on signs and certain morphometric measurements, their correlations are not always strong. Therefore, this study challenges the notion that all overweight horses are unhealthy, as overweight horses can still have good metabolic health. Conversely, lean horses may also experience metabolic issues. Hence, relying solely on visual cues is insufficient to diagnose the metabolic status of horses. Other factors must also be considered to assess their health status accurately. © 2024 The Author(s). Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Horses stay in different types of stables; especially during the cold season, they stay inside for most of the day. A stable is also a place where many people spend quite a lot of time either as employees who care for and train horses or as equine enthusiasts. Keeping horses in stables causes their constant exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and molds in the air inside these facilities. The study was conducted in Udórz Stud Farm located in the southern region of Poland. It was carried out in two different types of stables: three runners and two box stables. The study continued for 2 years; samples were collected in each season of the year. The following devices were used: a six-stage Andersen-Graseby cascade impactor, the DustTrak™ II Aerosol Monitor 8530. The obtained results allowed for the conclusion that horses kept in box stables are exposed to lower concentrations of molds and yeasts than those kept in runners. Molds dominated in the stable air during humid periods—spring and autumn—while yeasts were more prominent during summer and winter. It was observed that cleaning stables reduces the morphotic elements of fungi in the air, even though it results in a higher level of particulate matter in the stable air. It should be noted that microclimate conditions were optimal for horses practically throughout the whole year. Key points: • In stables, there is a high level of air intoxication, both by yeast and by mold fungi • The concentrations of fungi in the air depend on the season and the stable cleaning procedure • The PM concentrations depend on the type of stable © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), an important complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), is one of the most serious chronic heart diseases and has become a major cause of heart failure worldwide. At present, the pathogenesis of DCM is unclear, and there is still a lack of effective therapeutics. Previous studies have shown that the homeostasis of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) play a core role in maintaining cardiovascular function, and structural and functional abnormalities in these organelles seriously impact the occurrence and development of various cardiovascular diseases, including DCM. The interplay between mitochondria and the ER is mediated by the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), which participates in regulating energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, ER stress, inflammation, and other cellular processes. Recent studies have proven that MAM is closely related to the initiation and progression of DCM. In this study, we aim to summarize the recent research progress on MAM, elaborate on the key role of MAM in DCM, and discuss the potential of MAM as an important therapeutic target for DCM, thereby providing a theoretical reference for basic and clinical studies of DCM treatment.

ABSTRACT: Atrial fibrillation is a common tachyarrhythmia in racing horses associated with decreased performance. Transvenous electrical cardioversion is the preferred treatment for atrial fibrillation in those horses where medical therapy is either unsuccessful or unacceptable. Transvenous electrical cardioversion's main drawback is the necessity for general anaesthesia. This case series documents the details of three horses that were managed for sustained atrial fibrillation via transvenous electrical cardioversion procedures. In each case, the anaesthesia was maintained with the use of propofol and medetomidine intravenous infusions, which has not been previously reported for use in horses undergoing transvenous electrical cardioversion. Two of the horses were successfully converted without significant complications. One horse was unable to be converted after nine defibrillation attempts; however, anaesthesia was stable in all horses despite the concurrent use of antiarrhythmic drugs. No animal required inotropic support. Propofol-based protocols were safely utilised for three anaesthetics for transvenous electrical cardioversion with encouraging cardiovascular stability. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Gastric disease is highly prevalent in sport horses and may lead to poor performance, cause behavioral changes and impact welfare. Hypothesis: Assess whether diet affects gastric disease and pain expression during riding, and whether it has an impact on physiological and locomotor variables during an exercise test, including jumps. Animals: Nine healthy show-jumping Warmbloods trained at the same stable. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study. The horses receiving a pelleted diet, high in sugar and starch (>30%), were examined at T0 and after 12 weeks (T12) of changing to a cooked, muesli-type low-starch (11%) diet. Each time, the horses underwent a standardized exercise test (SET) and a ridden pain score (Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram [RHpE]) was calculated by 2 blinded observers. The next day, horses underwent gastroscopy and gastric lesions were scored blindly. Results were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Spearman tests. Results: After 12 weeks of a low starch diet, the Equine Gastric Disease (EGD; 4 [3–5] at T0 vs 1 [0-1] at T12, P <.01) and RHpE scores (6 [3–13] at T0 vs 3 [0-6] at T12, P <.01) improved significantly. Squamous, glandular, and EGD scores were positively correlated with RHpE scores (respectively, r =.747, P <.01; r =.743, P <.01 and r =.867, P <.01). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Gastric disease and pain scores correlated positively in ridden horses. A low starch diet significantly decreases the severity of gastric disease and associated pain score during riding in horses. Gastric ulcers may be mitigated and the comfort of equines athletes improved by dietary adjustments. © 2024 ESMP.

ABSTRACT: Background: Mixed strongylid infections significantly impact equine health and performance. Traditional microscopy-based methods exhibit limitations in accurately identifying strongylid species. Nemabiome deep amplicon sequencing approach previously succeeded in describing the strongylid communities in livestock including equids. However, there are no available studies that describe the structural communities of strongylid parasites in horses in Thailand. Therefore, this study was undertaken encompassing the ITS-2 rDNA metabarcoding assay to characterize strongylid species within horse fecal samples collected from a cohort of yearlings at the largest domesticated stud farm in Thailand. In addition, to investigate the capability of ITS-2 rDNA in assessing the phylogenetic relationships among the identified strongylid species. Results: The study identified 14 strongylid species in the examined equine populations, each with varying prevalence. Notably, Cylicocyclus nassatus and Cylicostephanus longibursatus were identified as the predominant species, with Strongylus spp. conspicuously absent. The phylogenetic analysis of 207 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) displayed a complex relationship among the investigated cyathostomin species, with some species are positioned across multiple clades, demonstrating close associations with various species and genera. Conclusion: The ITS-2 nemabiome sequencing technique provided a detailed picture of horse strongylid parasite species in the studied population. This establishes a foundation for future investigations into the resistance status of these parasites and enables efforts to mitigate their impact. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Ecosystem models provide a better understanding of fish populations and their environmental impacts. In this research, data from the Moroccan main ports landing logbook, along with two climate scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5), were used. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to analyze the relationships between landing per unit effort (LPUE), fishing effort, and environmental factors for both species. The study investigated the influence of climate scenarios on LPUE and fishing effort to project future potential landings for both species. In addition, it compared the proportional changes between 2022 and 2100, relative to the 2010-2022 average in the southern Alboran Sea. Phytoplankton was identified as the main driver of sardine LPUE, while sea level anomaly influenced Horse Mackerel LPUE. By the end of the 21st century, Sardine potential landings are projected to increase by +15% under RCP 8.5 and +80% under RCP 2.6 compared to the 2010-2022 average. In contrast, the Atlantic horse mackerel potential landings are expected to increase by +200% under RCP 2.6, while decreasing by-100% under RCP 8.5 by the end of the century. This research underscores the importance of considering environmental factors in managing small pelagic fisheries to ensure their sustainability in a changing climate. © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

ABSTRACT: Background: Testing for insulin dysregulation (ID) in horses is commonly performed to guide management and therapeutic strategies. Objectives: To evaluate a newly developed glycemic pellets challenge (GPC) and compare results to those obtained using the low-dose oral sugar test (OST). Animals: Twenty-four adult horses with unknown insulin status. Methods: A randomized crossover trial was performed. Horses underwent GPC (0.5 g glycemic carbohydrates/kg body weight) and OST (0.15 mL corn syrup/kg body weight) 7 days apart. Feed was withheld before testing and blood samples were collected at T0, T60, T120, and T180 minutes for GPC and at T0, T60, and T90 minutes for OST. Blood glucose concentration was measured using a point-of-care glucometer and insulin by radioimmunoassay. Comparisons were made using nonparametric tests, linear regression, and Bland-Altman agreement analysis. Results: Eighteen horses consumed >85% of the GPC pellets within 10 minutes and had acceptable OST results. Maximum glucose (P =.02) and insulin (P =.007) concentrations were significantly higher for GPC compared with OST. Time to maximum insulin concentration (Tmax[ins]) varied within and between tests and neither Tmax[ins] (P =.28) nor maximum insulin concentration (P =.46) was correlated with the time horses took to consume pellets. Conclusions: The GPC is well tolerated and may offer another diagnostic testing modality for ID. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations increase during GPC and reach higher concentrations than observed with low-dose OST. The Tmax[ins] varied for GPC and OST, emphasizing the importance of identifying the optimal time range for the collection of samples to capture diagnostically relevant changes in insulin concentration. © 2024 Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health and The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: To determine whether sensory nerve conduction stimulus threshold measurements of the infraorbital nerve are able to differentiate horses with idiopathic trigeminal-mediated headshaking (i-TMHS) from healthy horses and from horses with secondary trigeminal-mediated headshaking (s-TMHS). In a prospective trial, headshaking horses were examined using a standardized diagnostic protocol, including advanced diagnostics such as computed tomography and 3-Tesla-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to differentiate s-TMHS from i-TMHS. Clinically healthy horses served as controls. Within this process, patients underwent general anesthesia, and the minimal sensory nerve conduction stimulus threshold (SNCT) of the infraorbital nerve was measured using a bipolar concentric needle electrode. Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) were assessed in 2.5–5 mA intervals. Minimal SNCT as well as additional measurements were calculated. Results: In 60 horses, SNAP could be recorded, of which 43 horses had i-TMHS, six had suspected s-TMHS, three horses had non-facial headshaking, and eight healthy horses served as controls. Controls had a minimal SNCT ≥ 15 mA, whereas 14/43 horses with i-TMHS and 2/6 horses with s-TMHS showed a minimal SNCT ≤ 10 mA. Minimal SNCT ≤ 10 mA showed 100% specificity to distinguish TMHS from controls, but the sensitivity was only 41%. Conclusion: A minimal SNCT of the infraorbital nerve ≤ 10 mA was able to differentiate healthy horses from horses with TMHS. Nevertheless, a higher minimal SNCT did not exclude i-TMHS or s-TMHS and minimal SNCT does not distinguish s-TMHS from i-TMHS. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of loading density and gender on blood welfare indicators, carcass bruises and horsemeat quality. Data were collected from twelve transports of 89 slaughter horses originating from the same collection centre. The transportation of slaughter horses at high loading densities (>200 kg/m2), especially stallions, resulted in increased levels of lactate (p = 0.021), glucose (p < 0.0001), ceruloplasmin (p < 0.0001) and AOPP (p < 0.0001), but lower GSH levels (p < 0.0001). Compared to stallions and mares, geldings subjected to high loading density (>200 kg/m2) during transport had lower levels of the aforementioned blood metabolites. In addition, stallions exposed to a high load density (>200 kg/m2) had the highest frequency of severe (p = 0.0002), large (p < 0.0001) and circular (p = 0.0001) carcass bruises, which were predominantly located on the abdominal (p = 0.0056) and thoracic (p = 0.0004) wall. In contrast, a higher percentage (p < 0.0001) of undamaged carcasses was found in slaughter horses exposed to a low loading density (≤200 kg/m2) during transport. Stallions exposed to high loading densities (>200 kg/m2) during transport had the highest initial pH (p < 0.0001) and ultimate pH (p = 0.005) in terms of m. longissimus lumborum and redness (p = 0.017), but the lowest drip loss (p = 0.050) and lightness (p < 0.0001), which, consequently, led to the highest (p = 0.0045) proportion of DFD-like defects in the meat quality. In conclusion, the results of this study showed that high loading densities (>200 kg/m2), regardless of gender, negatively affect horse welfare during transport. In addition, stallions were more sensitive to poor pre-slaughter conditions and produced the lowest meat quality, while geldings were the most resistant. To determine the optimal transport density, further research is needed to determine the effects of different loading densities on the behaviour, physiology, carcass and meat quality of slaughter horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness (AHS) is an acute and subacute infectious disease of equine species caused by the African horse sickness virus (AHSV). The VP7 of AHSV is a group-specific protein conserved in all serotypes and is an excellent candidate for the serological diagnosis and an AHS vaccine component. However, to date, B-cell epitopes on the AHSV VP7 recognized by humoral immune responses remain unclear. This study expressed the recombinant AHSV VP7 soluble in Escherichia coli and purified it for mouse immunization. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were screened and identified by hybridoma cell fusion, clonal purification, and immunological assays. The B-cell epitopes, recognized by monoclonal antibodies 4B5, 3G10, 3D7, and 4D6, were identified by a series of truncated overlapping peptides expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins. The results revealed that 4B5 recognized the 124VQTGRYAGA132 motif, 3G10 recognized the 140RYYVPQGRT148 motif, while 3D7 and 4D6 recognized the 292QPINPPIFP300 motif. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that three novel B-cell epitopes were conserved among various AHSV serotypes but unconserved in other orbiviruses, such as the bluetongue and epidemic hemorrhagic disease viruses. This study informs on the antigenic epitopes of AHSV VP7, facilitating future investigations into the serological diagnosis method and epitope-based vaccines against AHSV. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Slow hoof growth poses a clinical challenge when hoof wear exceeds natural growth. Many treatment options have been reported without controlled prospective trials. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of transdermal CO2 on the rate of growth in treated hooves. METHODS A prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover study of 14 Warmblood mares. Horses were randomly assigned a number and allocated for treatment of the front feet with room air or CO2 for 30 minutes 3 times per week, and groups were switched after 5 weeks. Hoof growth was measured on the dorsal midline and the quarters of each front foot. The distance from coronary band to lines made on the hoof wall was measured at the beginning, middle, and end of the study. The percentage of change in length at each location relative to baseline was evaluated at 5 weeks and 10 weeks using nonparametric analyses. RESULTS All treatments were successfully administered. The left front medial (P =.028) and right front lateral (P =.03) sites of the CO2-treated hooves increased growth compared to the room air group at the 5-week point. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that repeated, noninvasive transdermal application of CO2 may accelerate hoof growth in normal horses over a 5-week treatment period. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study suggests that transdermal CO2 may increase the rate of hoof growth in normal horses. The mechanism of action of this treatment is unclear, and further studies are required to fully elucidate the potential effects. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: Varicellovirus equidalpha1 (formerly Equid alphaherpesvirus 1, EqAHV-1) is among the most important viruses responsible for respiratory disease outbreaks among horses throughout the world. No reports to date have detailed the association between EqAHV-1 and respiratory disease among horses in China. This study described one such outbreak among a population of horses in north Xinjiang that occurred from April 2021 - May 2023. Results: qPCR revealed that EqAHV-1 was detectable in all samples and this virus was identified as a possible source of respiratory disease, although a limited subset of these samples were also positive for EqAHV-2, EqAHV-4, and EqAHV-5. In total, three EqAHV-1 strains responsible for causing respiratory illness in horses were isolated successfully, and full-length ORF33 sequence comparisonsand phylogenetic analyses indicated that these isolates may have originated from EqAHV-1 strains detected in Yili horse abortions. ORF30 sequence data additionally suggested that these strains were neuropathic, as evidenced by the presence of a guanine residue at nucleotide position 2254 corresponding to the aspartic acid present at position 752 in the DNA polymerase encoded by this virus. Conclusion: This study is the first report of an outbreak of respiratory disease among horses in China caused by EqAHV-1. ORF30 sequence characterization revealed that these EqAHV-1 strains harbored a neuropathogenic genotype. Given the detection of this virus in horses suffering from respiratory disease, concern is warranted with respect to this neuropathogenic EqAHV-1 outbreak. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Furosemide, a commonly used diuretic, activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in other species. Little is known about RAAS peptide activation in horses. Hypothesis/Objectives: To evaluate equilibrium analysis as a practical method for RAAS quantification in horses and describe the RAAS response to a single dose of furosemide. We hypothesize that furosemide would cause transient increase in RAAS peptides in horses. Animals: 14 healthy adult thoroughbreds from a university teaching herd. Methods: Horses received either furosemide (1 mg/kg IV) or saline IV in a crossover study design. Protease-inhibited samples were compared with equilibrium analysis samples with Deming regression analysis. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones were evaluated at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 4, and 24 hours postadministration, via equilibrium analysis. Values were compared with a mixed effects model. Results: Correlation between protease inhibition and equilibrium analysis was high for angiotensin I peptide (AngI) and angiotensin II peptide (AngII) (r =.92 and.95, respectively). Baseline RAAS peptide concentrations were below the limit of detection except AngII (median, 7.5 [range, 3.5-14.0] pmol/L). Furosemide administration resulted in an increase in AngI (8.0 [0.5-15.5] pmol/L, P =.03), AngII (33.7 [9.6-57.9] pmol/L, P =.0008), angiotensin III peptide (AngIII) (2.9 [0.9-4.9] pmol/L, P =.0005), angiotensin IV peptide (AngIV) (2.0 [0.6-3.4] pmol/L, P =.0005), and angiotensin 1-5 peptide (Ang1-5) (5.6 [1.2-5.9] pmol/L, P =.003) at 4 hours. Differences are reported as difference in the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Furosemide produced an increase in hormones associated with both the classical and alternative RAAS pathways. Serum equilibrium analysis is practical for RAAS analysis in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Effective therapy for many infections is becoming difficult due to the evolutionary development of drug resistance, and hence, the development of alternative treatment options mainly from herbs is crucial. The objective of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of ethanol extracts of stem bark, leaves and roots of Combretum molle against Streptococcus equi isolated from clinical cases of strangles using in vitro tests. Methods: Plant extraction was performed using a maceration technique with 80% ethanol. The mean zone of inhibition was determined using the agar well diffusion method. Six serial dilutions with different concentrations (10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1.25%, 0.625% and 0.3125%) of each plant extract were prepared using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A modified agar microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of the extracts. Results: The results revealed that all plant extracts showed significant antibacterial activity. The root extract showed the best antibacterial effect compared to the others at all concentrations, with MZI values of 27.5, 23.225, 20.5, 17.9, 15.65 and 12.25 for the respective concentrations mentioned above and an MIC of 250 µg/ml. It was followed by the stem bark extract, which had MZI values of 24.67, 22.35, 18.225, 16.175, 11.125 and 8.2 millimeters and an MIC of 375 µg/ml. The leaf extract also had significant activity, with MZI values of 20.175, 18.25, 15.7, 13.125, 9.4 and 6.75 in millimeters and an MIC of 500 µg/ml. There was a direct relationship between the concentrations of the plant extracts and the level of inhibition. Conclusion: The test plant extracts were compared with the conventional antibiotic penicillin G, and the results indicated that the parts of the test plant have significant antibacterial activity, which may support traditional claims and could be candidates for alternative drug discoveries. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS) is a widespread disease. It shows variable clinical signs, such as behavioural changes, weight loss, and a reduced appetite, but it has a lack of obvious external symptoms and requires endoscopy for diagnosis. Saliva is gaining attention as a source of biomarkers for EGUS because it can show changes in its composition in response to this disease, and it is also easy and non-stressful to collect. Immunoglobulins (Igs) are important for detecting immune system dysfunctions. In this study, high concentrations of IgA in saliva were detected in horses with EGUS compared to healthy ones, and these changes correlated with other biomarkers from the immune system, such as adenosine deaminase. This would be in line with the results reported in humans, where IgA plays a role in mucosal protection and is elevated in gastric ulcers. These results indicate an involvement of the immune system in the development of EGUS in horses and open up the potential to use IgA as a possible biomarker of this disease. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Due to the increasing prevalence of equine non-infectious respiratory disease, the air contamination in equine housing (Stables A-C) and training facilities (indoor riding arenas A - C) was investigated. The aim of the study was to monitor gaseous pollutants, bioaerosols, and dust concentrations at three different sites (stables and riding halls), where different floor materials were used in the riding halls. Materials and methods: Air quality was monitored in housing for horses and in riding halls in terms of dust concentration, the presence of gaseous chemical pollutants, and concentrations of biological aerosol. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The levels obtained were compared with acceptable limits. Results: Among the gaseous pollutants identified, the highest concentration was obtained for ammonia in stables B and C (16.37 and 22.39 mg/m3, respectively). Standards for total dust were exceeded in stables B and C and in riding halls B and C. The highest numbers of bacteria and fungi were recorded in stables A and C and in riding hall B. Ulocladium sp. had the highest percentage share among the moulds identified. Conclusions: The results confirm that the wrong choice of bedding in the stable and indoor riding arenas may contribute, even in short training periods, to equine non-infectious respiratory disease (equine asthma). Bioaerosol suspended in the air together with released gaseous pollutants can exacerbate this phenomenon, which even in the case of short training periods can lead to equine asthma of varying degrees of severity. For this reason, the choice of floor material in riding halls should be treated as a priority, as the wrong decision can shorten the period during which the horse can be used for recreational purposes. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) in athletic horses is characterized by the presence of blood from the lungs in the tracheobronchial tree after intense exercise. Despite the high prevalence of EIPH in horses, the primary aetiology remains unknown. Variants in the genes encoding CD39 and CD39L1 (ENTPD1 and ENTPD2, respectively) were previously reported as potential genetic causes involved in EIPH pathogenesis. However, the role of these variants in haemostatic functions is unknown. Results: To investigate the association between EIPH and missense variants in the ENTPD1 (rs1152296272, rs68621348, and rs68621347) and ENTPD2 genes (rs782872967), 76 Thoroughbred horses diagnosed with EIPH and 56 without clinical signs of EIPH (control group) by trachea-bronchial endoscopy were genotyped. The rs1152296272 and rs68621347 variants were linked, which explained why the same results were found in all horses. Approximately 96% and 95% of the EIPH and control horses, respectively, carried at least one nonreference allele for these variants. In contrast, 100% of the control horses and 96% of the EIPH horses were homozygous for the reference allele for the rs68621348 variant. In the EIPH group, 1.5% of the horses were homozygotes and 24% were heterozygous for the nonreference allele of the rs782872967 variant. In the control group, the nonreference allele of this variant was observed only in heterozygotes (16%). There were no significant differences between groups for any of the variants. Conclusions: The variants previously described in the genes encoding the CD39 and CD39L1 enzymes were highly present in the studied population. However, no association was found between the occurrence of EIPH and the presence of these variants in Thoroughbred horses in this study. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The present article presents a case report and literature review concerning the Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SEZ), a rare zoonotic pathogen in humans. The case involves a 62-year-old man with no prior heart disease, presenting with endocarditis, pneumonia, and meningitis following close contact with a horse. The patient underwent urgent aortic valve replacement due to severe valvular damage caused by the infection. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures confirmed the presence of SEZ, and the patient was treated with a combination of antibiotics, followed by a successful step-down to oral therapy using linezolid. A review of 25 additional Streptococcus equi endocarditis cases highlights the rarity of the condition, its association with animal contact, and its tendency to cause multi-site infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis. Early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and, in severe cases, surgical intervention are critical for a favorable outcome. This report emphasizes the importance of recognizing zoonotic infections in at-risk populations and the potential need for public health surveillance in these scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine piroplasmosis is caused by two tick-borne protozoan parasites, Theileria equi and Babesia caballi,, which are clinically relevant in susceptible horses, donkeys, and mules. Moreover, equine piroplasmosis significantly constrains international trading and equestrian events. Rapidly diagnosing both parasites in carrier animals is essential for implementing effective control measures. Here, a rapid immunochromatographic test for the simultaneous detection of antibodies to T. equi and B. caballi was evaluated using samples from horses and donkeys collected in Greece, Israel, and Italy. The results were compared with an improved competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for detecting antibodies to both parasites using the same panel of samples. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 255 horses and donkeys. The panel consisted of 129 horses sampled at four locations in northern Greece, 105 donkeys sampled at four locations in Sicily, and 21 horses sampled at two locations in Israel. The rapid test and the cELISA were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the results were subjected to a statistical analysis to determine the sensitivity and specificity of both tests and their association. Results: The immunochromatographic test provided a result within 15 min and can be performed in the field, detecting both pathogens simultaneously. The overall coincidence rate between the rapid test and the cELISA for detecting antibodies against T. equi was 93% and 92.9% for B. caballi. The rapid test’s sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for T. equi were above 91.5%. Sixteen samples were positive for both parasites in the rapid test and eight in the cELISA. Either test had no significant association between T. equi and B. caballi detection. The detection rates of both parasites were significantly higher in Italy than in Greece or Israel and in donkeys than in horses. The agreement for T. equi between the results of both tests was high in Greece (93.8%) and Italy (95.2%) and moderate in Israel (76.2%). For B. caballi, the specificity and NPV of the rapid test were high (94.2% and 98.3%, respectively), although the sensitivity and PPV were moderate (69.2% and 39.1%, respectively) due to the small sample size. However, for B. caballi, the sensitivity was higher with the rapid test. Conclusions: The rapid test detected T. equi and B. caballi simultaneously in the field, potentially replacing laborious cELISA testing and is recommended for import/export purposes. The test can also be helpful for the differential diagnosis of clinical cases, since seropositivity may rule out equine piroplasmosis since it does not indicate current or active infection.

ABSTRACT: Equine renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare and poorly understood condition, making the diagnosis challenging. We present a case of a 16-year-old Warmblood gelding referred for lameness and suspected pneumonia. The horse exhibited diverse non-specific symptoms, including pyrexia, coughing, weight loss and lameness. Diagnostic imaging revealed an osseous neoplastic lesion and lung metastasis. Postmortem confirmed metastatic renal carcinoma. This case underscores the difficulty of RCC diagnosis due to non-specific clinical signs, necessitating a comprehensive approach involving clinical, imaging and histopathological findings. RCC offers limited treatment options as it is typically diagnosed at advanced stages, leading to a poor prognosis and euthanasia. Increased awareness and research are crucial for early detection and better understanding of this rare equine disease. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Elite performing exercise requires an intricate modulation of the blood pressure to support the working muscles with oxygen. We have previously identified a genomic regulatory module that associates with differences in blood pressures of importance for elite performance in racehorses. This study aimed to determine the effect of the regulatory module on the protein repertoire. We sampled plasma from 12 Coldblooded trotters divided into two endothelial regulatory module haplotype groups, a sub-elite performing haplotype (SPH) and an elite performing haplotype (EPH), each at rest and exercise. The haplotype groups and their interaction were interrogated in two analyses, i) individual paired ratio analysis for identifying differentially abundant proteins of exercise (DAPE) and interaction (DAPI) between haplotype and exercise, and ii) unpaired ratio analysis for identifying differentially abundant protein of haplotype (DAPH). The proteomics analyses revealed a widespread change in plasma protein content during exercise, with a decreased tendency in protein abundance that is mainly related to lung function, tissue fluids, metabolism, calcium ion pathway and cellular energy metabolism. Furthermore, we provide the first investigation of the proteome variation due to the interaction between exercise and related blood pressure haplotypes, which this difference was related to a faster switch to the lipoprotein and lipid metabolism during exercise for EPH. The molecular signatures identified in the present study contribute to an improved understanding of exercise-related blood pressure regulation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Recent studies have described techniques to acquire ultrasound measurements of the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle to investigate back pain in horses and monitor the response to rehabilitation. These techniques have been extrapolated from human research but have not been clinically validated in the horse. Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate whether measuring the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle in horses using ultrasound is a repeatable technique. Study design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Ultrasound images of the articular process view and interspinous view of the multifidus muscle were acquired at T15, T18, L2 and L5 on the left and right sides. Three images were acquired at each location and each image was measured three times to give an average cross-sectional area. Study 1 investigated the repeatability of acquiring images in a single session, and then on two separate days. Study 2 compared measurements of images acquired with a console (Philips EpiQ) and a portable (MyLab™Alpha) ultrasound machine. Study 3 investigated the repeatability of measuring the cross-sectional area using external software, OsiriX. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for each study. Results: Repeatability varied from good to excellent for images taken in a single session. The repeatability for measuring the images using external software was good to excellent. There was poor-to-moderate repeatability for images taken on two different days and poor-to-good repeatability when using the two different machines. Main limitations: Population size, study population limited to a single breed, only one operator. Conclusions: The measurement of the multifidus muscle in horses has poor repeatability and may have limited application. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses were initially managed and domesticated in Central Asia during the Neolithic period for their utilization as a source of sustenance and transportation. Subsequently, they came to symbolize the elevated status of individuals when interred alongside elites in nomadic cultures during the Bronze Age in the eastern Eurasian Steppe. This practice was also adopted in China and became an indispensable component of Zhou rituals, with its origins dating back to the Late Shang Dynasty and subsequently spreading throughout the Western Zhou Dynasty. The understanding of horse management for sacrificial purposes after its introduction to China remains limited. In this study, we present isotopic data (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S, δ18O) and 14C-dating results obtained from equine bones discovered at the Yaoheyuan site in Ningxia, China, which served as a vassal state attached to Western Zhou. The dating analysis reveals that horses lived during the period of 1203 BC∼821 BC (2σ, 95.4%), within the chorological range of the early to middle Western Zhou Dynasty generally. The multi-isotope analysis demonstrates that sacrificial horses exhibited diverse dietary patterns and originated from various regions, highlighting how burial owners held dominant authority over valuable equine resources. Similar patterns of horse management can be observed across other sites in China during both the Bronze Age and Iron Age periods as well as within the eastern Eurasian Steppe region. This suggests that horse sacrificial ritual originated from this steppe region but became localized within Chinese culture upon its introduction to China and eventually turned into an intrinsic characteristic of Zhou ritual practices. Sustaining such widespread adoption of this ritual throughout Western Zhou period required a continuous social network, including a self-sustained system to raise horse locally and an imported system to obtain horses in the steppe by wars, tributes, or trade exchange. Our study offers the earliest direct evidence of the ceremonial handling of equine sacrifices and the crucial social network during the Western Zhou Dynasty, enhancing our comprehension of cultural exchange between the eastern Eurasian Steppe and China. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: As group housing of horses can be associated with increased injury risk especially when there are limited resources, the aim of this study was to allow initial, scientifically based recommendations regarding the positioning and design of straw feeders. Data collection took place in a Hinrichs Innovation + Technik (HIT) active stable with 50–62 horses kept in one single group. Occupancy, feeding distances, prevalence of agonistic interactions (AIS) as well as the percentage of feeding disturbances at two different straw feeders were analysed. Equine behaviour was recorded for 6 h/day on 15 summer and 15 winter days. Using generalised linear mixed models, considering the fixed effects of feeder, a fresh straw supply and the interaction of observation day and time period delivered the best prediction for the number of feeding events/h and the prevalence of AIS/h. Here, both feeders differed (p < 0.05) with twice as many feeding events/h, but threefold more AIS/h respectively twice as many AIS/horse at the larger feeder, where conspecifics fed side by side. Sixty-five % of the AIS with low risk of injury and 92 % of the AIS with high risk of injury led to feeding disturbances. The latter made up 25 % of all AIS in total with no differences between both feeders. Feeding distances did not differ either. The horses tended to use only every third opening space when feeding simultaneously. This knowledge should be taken into account when making assumptions about the de facto animal:feeding place ratio and the design of straw feeders in the future. Moreover, regarding the smaller feeder, the horses preferred to feed simultaneously with the feeder edge between them, so that the actual animal distances were smaller. Additional research is needed to investigate, how feeding in rectangular position to each other influences threatening behaviour inside a feeder. In this study, a central positioning within a paddock was beneficial with respect to feeder usage, but disadvantageous regarding AIS and displacements. However, the investigation of further straw feeders and farms is essential to allow general statements, as the study also proves that many factors such as season and rank order stability potentially influence equine behaviour at straw feeders. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: The global prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) and blood parasite infections in horses is a significant concern due to their substantial impact on morbidity, mortality, and economic losses in the horse industry. In Thailand, limited research has been conducted on these parasites in horse populations, and data from southern Thailand are lacking. Consequently, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of GI and blood parasites in horses in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand. Materials and Methods: In total, 79 fecal and blood samples were collected from horses across 11 farms in Nakhon Si Thammarat province. The fecal examination was conducted using simple flotation, formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation, and a modified McMaster technique. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify blood and strongyle parasites. The influence of sex, age, and body condition score on the prevalence of GI parasites was also analyzed. Results: Six GI parasites were detected: four nematodes (Oxyuris equi, Parascaris equorum, strongyles, and Strongyloides westeri), one trematode (Gastrodiscus aegyptiacus), and one protozoan (Eimeria leuckarti). The overall prevalence of GI parasites was 74.7%, with single strongyle infections accounting for the highest proportion at 50.6%, followed by co-infections of strongyles and G. aegyptiacus at 10.1%. All 11 pooled strongyle samples were positive for cyathostomins and Strongylus vulgaris using conventional PCR with specific primers. Sex was significantly associated with the overall prevalence of GI parasites, whereas both sex and age were significant risk factors for infection by strongyle parasites. Theileria equi was the only blood parasite species detected in the surveyed horses, with a prevalence of 1.3% (n = 1/79). Conclusion: This study is the first to estimate the prevalence of GI and blood parasites in horses from Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand. These findings highlight the importance of implementing control measures against GI parasites and are pivotal for developing effective infection prevention strategies. © 2024 Veterinary World.

ABSTRACT: Aims: Zoonotic arboviruses (arthropod-borne) of the Orthoflavivirus genus, such as West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), are emerging in Northwestern Europe and pose a threat to both human and animal health. In the Netherlands, passive symptomatic surveillance (notification of clinical cases) in horses is one of the main pillars for the early detection of WNV. For such passive surveillance to work properly, horse owners and veterinarians need to recognize symptoms and report suspected cases to the authorities. Currently, little is known about the seroprevalence of orthoflaviviruses in domestic animals in the Netherlands. Therefore, this study aims at identifying the seroprevalence of WNV and USUV in horses and dogs in the Netherlands. Additionally, this study seeks to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions of Dutch horse owners towards mosquito-borne viruses. Methods and Results: A cross-sectional serosurvey in horses and dogs was conducted between May 2021 and May 2022. Serum samples were screened using an ELISA and doubtful and positive samples were confirmed by Virus Neutralization Tests for WNV, USUV and TBEV. A validated questionnaire, the MosquitoWise survey, was used to assess the knowledge and perceptions of Dutch horse owners towards mosquito-borne viruses between July and October 2022. The serosurvey revealed a low seroprevalence for WNV in horses and no WNV-positive dogs were found. Similarly, a low USUV seroprevalence was found in dogs. The MosquitoWise survey revealed a high knowledge level for horse owners and high awareness of WNV vaccination but a more limited intent to vaccinate. Conclusions: The low seroprevalences of WNV and USUV indicate many dogs and horses remain susceptible, offering opportunities for trend analysis and surveillance. However, despite multiple recent detections of WNV, USUV, and TBEV in humans, the role of dogs and horses in early detection of human cases is debatable. High awareness among horse owners and the absence of detected equine WNV cases highlight this uncertainty. Continued surveillance is crucial for detecting increased virus circulation and protecting both animal and human health. © 2024 The Author(s). Zoonoses and Public Health published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Background: Respirable mineral particles can induce lower airway inflammation, but the role they play in asthma of horses is unknown. Objectives: Respirable mineral particles, particularly respirable silica, are an overlooked determinant of chronic lung inflammation (asthma) in horses. Animals: Twenty-three horses from an equine hospital population: 11 moderately affected (MEA), 7 severely asthmatic (SEA), and 5 control horses free from respiratory clinical signs. Methods: Prospective observational study. The quantity and quality of mineral particles found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were characterized, with particular attention to silica content. Polarized light microscopy performed on cytospin slides identified intracellular birefringent particles as silica. Spectrometry-based analysis performed on whole BALF determined total mineral and silica percentage and concentration. Group-related differences in BALF mineral and silica load were investigated as well as associations with BALF cytology. Results: Intracellular birefringent particles were increased in SEA vs MEA (median [interquartile range, IQR]), 12 [7] vs 4 [5] particles/30 high power fields [hpf], respectively; P =.01) and vs controls (4 [2] particles/30 hpf; P =.02). Total mineral concentration in BALF was similar between the groups studied, whereas silica concentration and percentage were increased in SEA vs MEA (1758 [887] particles/mL and 20 [10]% vs 867 [662] particles/mL and 8 [6]%; P =.009 and P =.001) and control group (355 [330] particles/mL and 6 [3]%; P =.0003 and P =.002). Silica load in BALF was associated with BALF neutrophilia in MEA and SEA. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Respirable silica is associated with neutrophilic lower airway inflammation in horses and might contribute to asthma development. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Parasitic infections are among the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in horses worldwide. In the Andean mountainous regions of Chile, horses are a highly valued specie, playing a key role as working animals also providing support in cattle transhumance grazing into high mountainous areas during dry season. The breeding and maintenance of horses in the mountainous region of La Araucanía in Chile is a key issue allowing to the subsistence economy of communities with a strong ethnic component represented by Mapuche-Pehuenche origin families. However, the health status of these animals is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine endoparasitic infections in horses from this area and the main factors that may influence parasitism. Thus, a cross-sectional study performed in 126 working horses from Andean region was achieved by using different coproparasitologycal analyses, resulting in a 97,6% of prevalence of endoparasitism with the strongyle eggs showing the highest prevalence of infection in analysed horses (96%) followed by Oxyuris equi (27%), Parascaris equorum (17,5%) and protozoans including ciliates (11,1%), Blastocystis spp (5,6%), Giardia spp (2,4%) and Cryptosporidium spp (1,6%) highlighting zoonotic relevance of some of these species. Concerning risk factors, the high prevalence suggests that exposure was high regardless of age or sex. The higher proportion of infected horses were grazing compared to those stabled, likewise drinking non-potable water, being these the main risks factors linked to the high prevalence of horse infections in Andean communities here studied. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Morphometric traits discrepancies are associated with production, reproduction, adaptation and behaviours in horses. It also determines the design of harnessing implements, physical injury level and working performance of the native horses. Thus, the study was conducted to evaluate morphometric traits and body conformation indices of horse ecotypes reared across four districts of Bale Zone, Ethiopia. Methods: Data of croup height, croup length, hip height, mid-back height, wither height, hip width, thoracic depth, chest width, body length, sternum height, thorax perimeter and cannon perimeter were measured in 500 horses (294 male and 206 female). Using those traits, 17 body conformation indices were calculated to define the horses for multi-faceted performances. Results: The study revealed that croup height, hip height, wither height, hip width, croup length, body length, thorax perimeter and sternum height were significantly (p < 0.0001) different among the studied districts. The district effect was also significant at p < 0.05 for mid-back height, thoracic depth, chest width and cannon perimeter. The sexual dimorphism effect was statistically significant for all measured traits; however, females were inferior to males except for cannon perimeter. Body conformation indices of pelvic index, body index, transversal pelvic index and weight were highly significant (p < 0.0001) among the studied districts. The sex dimorphism effect was significant (p < 0.001) for dactyl-costal index, pelvic index, longitudinal pelvic index, transversal pelvic index, weight, tare index 1 (trot or gallop), tare index 2 (walk) and riding comfort degree, while non-significant (p > 0.05) for the remaining indices. The studied horses were classified as mediline, elipometric, light, small and suitable riding ecotypes with a medium-conforming body structure and good capacity for carrying loads on carts and backs for functional effectiveness. The correlations of body conformation indices ranged from very high to low, with positive and negative associations for functional capabilities. Conclusion: Therefore, selection for improvement needs to rank morphometric traits and body conformation indices in correlation to developing racing and modern sport horses in the highlands of the Bale eco-regions. Further, molecular studies will be essential to determine whether the predominated phenotypic multiplicity is genetic or environmentally progressed. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Limited information is available on gastric diseases in neonatal foals as compared with extensive studies in young, adult, and geriatric horses. Reports on fetuses are scarce. Objectives: Assess at necropsy stomachs of horse, donkey and mule fetuses in the third trimester of gestation to characterize lesions present during intrauterine life. Animals: Forty-six fetal stomachs from both sexes (21 horses, 21 donkeys, and 4 mules) in the third trimester of gestation were collected from a processing plant immediately after slaughter. Methods: Measurements of longitudinal and transverse axes, weight and volume and gastric fluid pH were taken, and glandular and squamous mucosae were inspected. All findings of the gastric mucosa and measurements of the stomachs were presented descriptively. Groups were compared statistically, with significance level set at P <.05 for all evaluations. Results: All gastric contents had pH >5.8, and mules had larger stomachs and higher weights compared with horses (P <.05). Macroscopic lesions were classified as hyperemic, punctate, and erosive. Histopathologically, lesions were consistent with a chronic inflammatory process. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Our study provides evidence of macroscopic and histopathological lesions in the gastric mucosae of equid fetuses in the last trimester of gestation. Relevant information for perinatology and neonatology is provided regarding the prevalence and classification of preulcerous lesions in equids before birth. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Severe Combined Immuno Deficiency (SCID) is a heritable deficiency transmitted through autosomal recessive gene, carried on by purebred Arabian and crossbred horses. A deletion of five base pairs at the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the Protein Kinase DNA-dependent (DNA-PKcs) is responsible for this disease and SCID-affected animals always die in the first six months of life. Considering this problem, it is important to perform a molecular epidemiological study to estimate the frequency of the SCID allele in Arabian purebred horses in Tunisia. Methods: The DNA of the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 164 purebred Arabian horses belonging to the Sidi Thabet stud was extracted by the spin-column method, in order to verify the quality of the DNAs used, the samples were dosed by a spectrophotometer. The amplification of the DNA was carried out by two specific primers in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to flank the deletion zone of the DNA sample by adding to each PCR sample a marker or a standard of size knowing that the fragment we wanted to amplify is composed of 163 base pairs. Then, the PCR products were sequenced using an automatic sequencer. Result: By analyzing the electropherograms results, we noted the absence of the SCID deletion in the studied group of Arab purebreds. Hence, it is essential to carry out molecular screening of the SCID deletion in other sites in order to determine its prevalence in the country’s purebred Arabian horse population. © 2024 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: Equine Piroplasmosis (EP) and Equine Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (EGA) are diseases that affect horses, transmitted by ixodid ticks, causing a nonspecific febrile syndrome. Equine Piroplasmosis is endemic in Brazil, and most horses are in enzootic stability. Serological and molecular studies carried out on horses in Brazil have shown the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, however, the clinical relevance of this infection has not yet been established. The present study aims to evaluate the importance of Babesia caballi, Theileria equi, and A. phagocytophilum as etiological agents in horses with clinical manifestations suggestive of these diseases in the metropolitan mesoregion of Rio de Janeiro. A total of 45 animals with clinical signs were submitted to DNA extraction followed by qPCR test. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Neorickettsia risticii and Theileria haneyi were not found in any of the horses with clinical signs, however 62.2% were infected with at least one agent of EP. Theileria equi was the most frequent etiologic agent (35.5%), followed by coinfection (15.5%) and B. caballi (11.2%). These results suggest that A. phagocytophilum has minor clinical importance in the region, while EP is frequently found in symptomatic horses, representing an important differential diagnosis in suspected cases. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Mongolian horses are characterized by strong endurance in sports and their meat is a special food resource in Inner Mongolia, China. To assess the characteristics of the Mongolian horses in terms of exercise and meat quality, in this study, we selected healthy and untrained adult stallions and collected a total of 24 skeletal muscles from representative parts of the whole body (head and neck, forelimb, trunk, abdominal wall side, and hindlimb) for transcriptome sequencing. After grouping by site, using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, differential expression analysis between two sites was performed to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different skeletal muscle sites, and the up-regulated DEGs at each site were pooled and enriched to obtain the relevant genes and pathways specific to each skeletal muscle site. The semimembranosus and gastrocnemius were selected from the hindlimb for phenotypic studies of fast and slow muscle fibers as well as RNA-Seq analysis. We found that the semimembranosus had 71.69% of slow muscle fibers and 124 up-regulated DEGs. The gastrocnemius had 78.93% of fast muscle fibers and 31 up-regulated DEGs. The results showed that the biochemical properties of horse skeletal muscle were altered by site and the percentage of fast and slow muscle fibers in the skeletal muscle. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Schöningen 13II-4 site is a marvel of Paleolithic archaeology. With the extraordinary preservation of complete wooden spears and butchered large mammal bones dating from the Middle Pleistocene, Schöningen maintains a prominent position in the halls of human origins worldwide. Here, we present the first analysis of the complete large mammal faunal assemblage from Schöningen 13II-4, drawing on multiple lines of zooarchaeological and taphonomic evidence to expose the full spectrum of hominin activities at the site—before, during, and after the hunt. Horse (Equus mosbachensis) remains dominate the assemblage and suggest a recurrent ambush hunting strategy along the margins of the Schöningen paleo-lake. In this regard, Schöningen 13II-4 provides the first undisputed evidence for hunting of a single prey species that can be studied from an in situ, open-air context. The Schöningen hominins likely relied on cooperative hunting strategy to target horse family groups, to the near exclusion of bachelor herds. Horse kills occurred during all seasons, implying a year-round presence of hominins on the Schöningen landscape. All portions of prey skeletons are represented in the assemblage, many complete and in semiarticulation, with little transport of skeletal parts away from the site. Butchery marks are abundant, and adult carcasses were processed more thoroughly than were juveniles. Numerous complete, unmodified bones indicated that lean meat and marrow were not always so highly prized, especially in events involving multiple kills when fat and animal hides may have received greater attention. The behaviors displayed at Schöningen continue to challenge our perceptions and models of past hominin lifeways, further cementing Schöningen's standing as the archetype for understanding hunting adaptations during the European Middle Pleistocene. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Knowledge on horse symmetry and regularity is essential for every training/rehabilitation programs. Present studies compare biomechanical parameters for different treadmill positions, but not the effect of such exercise. The aim of the presented work was to study recreation horse movement parameters before and immediately after inclined short-duration exercise in walk. The hypothesis was that inclined short-duration exercise gave greater stride regularity and symmetry. Walk biomechanical parameters of 12 Warmblood recreation horses were monitored as temporal data using video analysis [50 frames/s] before and after 5-minute inclined work on a treadmill at 3% incline. Control group (6 horses) consisted from earlier evaluated horses that performed on the other day the same walk exercise without incline. Analysis of variance was conducted for temporal and spatial parameters of walk (237 measurements for incline and 109 for control) using the Mixed SAS procedure. For both data sets the statistical model with the random effect of horse, fixed effects of exercise and successive stride was applied. Control group showed not differences before/after short walk exercise. The influence of inclined exercise was statistically significant for the lateral limbs sequence, regularity and standard deviation of strides regularity (p<0.05). The lateral limbs sequence and regularity increased after inclined exercise (3-5%). The standard deviation of regularity was almost 2-fold lower. Inclined treadmill exercise has a positive effect on walk regularity. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: A five-year-old Dales gelding was presented with an eight-week history of progressive, apparently nonpainful, cord-like, subcutaneous masses across the face, neck, trunk and forelimbs. Physical and neurological examinations identified mild, diffuse weakness, hyperaesthesia and moderate tachycardia. Transcutaneous and transrectal ultrasonography and endoscopy of the guttural pouches confirmed marked enlargement of peripheral nerves and visible cranial nerves, respectively. Histopathology of the subcutaneous lesions was indicative of chronic lymphoplasmacytic polyneuritis with fibrosis. The horse failed to respond to treatment with glucocorticoids, showing progressive generalised weakness and was euthanised. Post-mortem examination identified a generalised lymphadenopathy and widespread dissemination of neoplastic lymphocytes, throughout the peripheral and central nervous system, heart and liver, identified by immunohistochemistry as T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma. This is the first report in the veterinary literature of diffuse neurolymphomatosis presenting as visible branching subcutaneous masses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness (AHS) is an acute, fatal, contagious disease of animals of the family Equidae and is caused by infection with the African horse sickness virus (AHSV). Based on the outer capsid protein VP2, AHSV is classified into nine serotypes (AHSV−1 to −9) with little or no serological cross-reactivity between them. In 2020, AHS outbreaks caused by AHSV−1 were reported in Thailand and Malaysia, marking the first occurrences of AHS in Southeast Asia. However, little is known about the antigenic profile of AHSV−1 VP2. In this study, a recombinant VP2 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and used as an immunogen, and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated 7D11, 10A9, and 9E7, against AHSV−1 VP2, were generated. These three mAbs were then successfully used in IFA, WB, and ELISA for the detection of AHSV−1 VP2. Two overlapping linear epitopes, 670NEFDFE675 (E670–675) recognized by 9E7 and 670NEFDF674 (E670–674) recognized by 7D11 and 10A9, were identified through truncation of GST-fused VP2. Amino acid sequence alignment shows that the 670NEFDFE675 motif is completely conserved within AHSV−1 but is highly divergent in other AHSV serotypes. Our studies provide an important tool for basic research into AHSV−1 and for the diagnosis of AHSV−1. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Characterizing the lipid response to an oral glucose test (OGT) might improve our understanding of Equine Metabolic Syndrome. Hypothesis/Objectives: To describe the effects of an OGT on lipid metabolism and determine the value of measuring triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations in hyperinsulinemic (HI) and insulin-resistant (IR) horses. Animals: Twenty horses including 7 HI-IR horses, 4 HI-non-IR horses, and 9 non-HI-non-IR horses (control). Methods: Cross-sectional design. Horses underwent an OGT, with blood samples collected at 0, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Insulin, glucose, triglyceride, and NEFA concentrations were measured and compared over time and between groups, with P <.05 considered significant. Results: In all horses, the OGT had a significant effect on triglyceride concentrations (median [interquartile range]:.35 [.30-.50] mmol/L at 0 minute vs.25 [.21-.37] mmol/L at 120 minutes, P =.005) and on NEFA concentrations (.1 [.1-.2] mEq/L at 0 minute vs.05 [.05-.1] mEq/L at 120 minutes, P =.0009). However, horses with HI and IR had higher triglyceride areas under the curve (AUC, 79.46 ± 46.59 vs 33.32 ± 6.75 mmol/L*min, P =.01) as well as NEFA AUC (9.1 ± 2.9 vs 6.0 ± 6.8 mEq/L*min, P =.03) than control horses. No significant difference was detected between control and HI non-IR horses. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Determining triglyceride and NEFA concentrations might help assess tissue insulin resistance during an OGT. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Liver fluke infection, caused by the trematode Fasciola hepatica, is a parasitic zoonotic disease affecting various mammals, including humans, and has significant implications for public, animal, and ecosystem health. This study provides the first genetic characterization of F. hepatica in Chile, focusing on the complete mitochondrial gene cox1. Samples were collected from two different host species: cattle and horses. Our findings revealed that 70 % of detected haplotypes were found in either cattle or horses, which coincides with their geographical origin. Interestingly, the use of full-length sequences resulted in the identification of 80 % unique sequences, whereas this reduced to 45 % when analyzing the traditionally used short sequences. This underestimation of genetic diversity suggests that broader sequencing efforts might be essential for a more accurate understanding of F. hepatica genetic landscape. This research underscores the importance of understanding the genetic variability in parasites to improve strategies for disease control and treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Gut microbiomes are widely hypothesised to influence host fitness and have been experimentally shown to affect host health and phenotypes under laboratory conditions. However, the extent to which they do so in free-living animal populations and the proximate mechanisms involved remain open questions. In this study, using long-term, individual-based life history and shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing data (2394 fecal samples from 794 individuals collected between 2013–2019), we quantify relationships between gut microbiome variation and survival in a feral population of horses under natural food limitation (Sable Island, Canada), and test metagenome-derived predictions using short-chain fatty acid data. We report detailed evidence that variation in the gut microbiome is associated with a host fitness proxy in nature and outline hypotheses of pathogenesis and methanogenesis as key causal mechanisms which may underlie such patterns in feral horses, and perhaps, wild herbivores more generally. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: The pleiotropic effects of the melanocortin system show promise in overcoming limitations associated with large variations in opioid analgesic effectiveness observed in equine practice. Of particular interest is variation in the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, which dictates pigment type expression through its epistatic interaction with the agouti signalling protein (ASIP) gene. MC1R has previously been implicated in opioid efficacy in other species; however, this relationship is yet to be explored in horses. In this study, analgesic effectiveness was scored (1-3) based on noted response to dura penetration during the performance of cerebrospinal fluid centisis after sedation and tested for association with known genetic regions responsible for pigmentation variation in horses. Results: The chestnut phenotype was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in lowering analgesic effectiveness when compared to the bay base coat colour. The 11bp indel in ASIP known to cause the black base coat colour was not significant (P>0.05); however, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the genomic region encoding the ASIP gene and one within MC1R were identified as being nominally significant (P<0.05) in association with opioid analgesic effectiveness. This included the location of the known e MC1R variant resulting in the chestnut coat colour. Conclusions: The current study provides promising evidence for important links between pigmentation genes and opioid effectiveness in horses. The application of an easily identifiable phenotype indicating variable sensitivity presents a promising opportunity for accessible precision medicine in the use of analgesics and warrants further investigation. © Crown 2024.

ABSTRACT: The gut microbiota is a treasure trove of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To explore novel and efficient CAZymes, we analyzed the 4,142 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of the horse gut microbiota and found the MAG117.bin13 genome (Bacteroides fragilis) contains the highest number of polysaccharide utilisation loci sites (PULs), indicating its high capability for carbohydrate degradation. Bioinformatics analysis indicate that the PULs region of the MAG117.bin13 genome encodes many hypothetical proteins, which are important sources for exploring novel CAZymes. Interestingly, we discovered a hypothetical protein (595 amino acids). This protein exhibits potential CAZymes activity and has a lower similarity to CAZymes, we named it BfLac2275. We purified the protein using prokaryotic expression technology and studied its enzymatic function. The hydrolysis experiment of the polysaccharide substrate showed that the BfLac2275 protein has the ability to degrade α-lactose (156.94 U/mg), maltose (92.59 U/mg), raffinose (86.81 U/mg), and hyaluronic acid (5.71 U/mg). The enzyme activity is optimal at pH 5.0 and 30 ℃, indicating that the hypothetical protein BfLac2275 is a novel and multifunctional CAZymes in the glycoside hydrolases (GHs). These properties indicate that BfLac2275 has broad application prospects in many fields such as plant polysaccharide decomposition, food industry, animal feed additives and enzyme preparations. This study not only serves as a reference for exploring novel CAZymes encoded by gut microbiota but also provides an example for further studying the functional annotation of hypothetical genes in metagenomic assembly genomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Objective: Livestock droppings cause some environmental problems, but they have the potential to be used as effective biomass resources. The black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), is suitable for efficiently processing such resources. By using BSF larvae for the disposal of livestock droppings, we can obtain two valuable products: protein resources and organic fertilizer. However, there is insufficient research on the digestive enzymes suitable for processing this waste. Here, we aimed to construct an efficient BSF processing system using livestock droppings, and we explored the digestive enzymes involved in this process. Results: First, we investigated the characteristics of transcripts expressed in the midgut of BSF larvae and found that immune response-related genes were expressed in the midgut. Then, we investigated digestive enzymes and identified a novel serine protease, HiBrachyurin, whose mRNA was highly expressed in the posterior midgut when BSF larvae fed on horse droppings. Despite the low protein content of horse droppings, larvae that fed on horse droppings accumulated more protein than those in the other groups. Therefore, HiBrachyurin may contribute to digestibility in the early stage of protein degradation in BSF larvae fed on horse droppings. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: A 16-year-old horse, 400 kg, male, Quarter horse gelding was examined for a cardiac murmur that had not been previously heard. Physical examination revealed a regularly irregular pulse and a grade III/VI, decrescendo, diastolic murmur with a point of maximum intensity over the left heart base. Base-apex standard electrocardiographic examination at rest showed sinus rhythm with second-degree atrio-ventricular blocks. Echocardiography identified the presence of four aortic valve cusps, two equal larger and two unequal smaller cusps. Color flow Doppler examination showed a diastolic regurgitant jet emerging from the central region of closed aortic valve. Based on clinical and echocardiographic findings a diagnosis of mild to moderate aortic valve insufficiency secondary to quadricuspid aortic valve was made. This report describes a rare congenital heart defect that can be detected by transthoracic echocardiography in the horse. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is a Gram-positive zoonotic pathogen that frequently leads to illness and death in young horses (foals). This study presents the complete genome sequence of R. equi strain BJ13, which was isolated from a thoroughbred racehorse breeding farm in Beijing, China. Results: The BJ13 genome has a length of 5.30 Mb and consists of a complete chromosome and a plasmid measuring 5.22 Mb and 0.08 Mb, respectively. We predicted 4,929 coding gene open reading frames, along with 52 tRNAs and 12 rRNAs. Through analysis of mobile genetic elements, we identified 6 gene islands and 1 prophage gene. Pathogenic system analysis predicted the presence of 418 virulence factors and 225 drug resistance genes. Secretion system analysis revealed the prediction of 297 secreted proteins and 1,106 transmembrane proteins. BJ13 exhibits genomic features, virulence-associated genes, potential drug resistance, and a virulence plasmid structure that may contribute to the evolution of its pathogenicity. Lastly, the pathogenicity of the isolated strain was assessed through animal experiments, which resulted in inflammatory reactions or damage in the lungs, liver, and spleen of mice. Moreover, by the 7th day post-infection, the mortality rate of the mice reached 50.0%, indicating complex immune regulatory mechanisms, including overexpression of IL-10 and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α. These findings validate the strong pathogenicity of the isolated strain and provide insights for studying the pathogenic mechanisms of Rhodococcus equi infection. Conclusions: The complete genome sequence of R. equi strain BJ13 provides valuable insights into its genomic characteristics, virulence potential, drug resistance, and secretion systems. The strong pathogenicity observed in animal experiments underscores the need for further investigation into the pathogenic mechanisms of R. equi infection. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Studies on short- and long-term memory and their decline with aging in horses are still limited. This research aimed to assess the learning and short- and long-term memory abilities of adult and senior horses. A total of 21 adult horses (5–15 years) and 23 senior horses (16 years and older) were subjected to a behavioral test (Target Touch Test), which was repeated three times each for the initial test (T1) and again after 10 days (T10). Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between adult and senior horses in the three tests conducted at T1. However, a significant difference was observed at T10 (χ2 = 42.1; p < 0.001). In fact, senior horses took longer to complete the test than adults. A significant difference between males and females, adults and seniors, at T1 and T10 (χ2 = 56.3; p < 0.001) was found, but no difference between male and female adult and senior horses in completing the three single tests at T1 and T10 was evidenced. In conclusion, even senior horses are capable of associative learning, maintaining the memory of this learning even after 10 days. However, they show slower recovery times for recalling memorized information compared to animals under 16 years of age. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Professor Gerhard Sand (1861–1921) was the first professor of veterinary obstetrics at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Copenhagen, Denmark. He began teaching the theory and practice of obstetrics to veterinary students in 1887 and spent the following years until his death in 1921 developing the veterinary obstetrics teaching program. During this period, veterinary obstetrics was established as an independent discipline at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University. Professor Sand’s teaching had a major impact on the field of veterinary obstetrics in Scandinavia. He was devoted to teaching veterinary obstetrics and produced a number of obstetrical illustrations, some of which showed different causes of dystocia, mainly fetal malpresentation in cattle and horses. Professor Sand created the illustrations with the intention of publishing a handbook of obstetrics, but due to illness and an early death, this work was never completed. This compilation of historical artworks of dystocia in cattle and horses includes some of these illustrations and is published to honour Professor Sand, with the intention of making his illustrations widely available for the teaching of veterinary obstetrics. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Reintroduction represents an effective strategy for the conservation of endangered wildlife, yet it might inadvertently impact the native ecosystems. This investigation assesses the impact of reintroducing endangered Przewalski's horses into the desert grassland ecosystem of the Kalamaili Nature Reserve (KNR), particularly its effect on the spatial distribution of ticks. In a 25 km2 core area of Przewalski's horse distribution, we set up 441 tick sampling sites across diverse habitats, including water sources, donkey trails, and grasslands, recording horse feces and characteristics to analyze the occurrence rate of ticks. Additionally, we gathered the data of 669 fresh feces of horses. To evaluate the spatial dynamics between these feces and ticks, we used methods such as Fixed Kernel Estimation (FKE), Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation index, and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Results: The dominant species of ticks collected in the core area were adult Hyalomma asiaticum (91.36%). Their occurrence rate was higher near donkey trails (65.99%) and water sources (55.81%), particularly in areas with the fresh feces of Przewalski's horses. The ticks’ three risk areas, as defined by FKE, showed significant overlap and positive correlation with the distribution of Przewalski's horses, with respective overlap rates being 90.25% in high risk, 33.79% in medium risk, and 23.09% in low risk areas. Moran's I analysis revealed a clustering trend of the fresh feces of Przewalski's horses in these areas. The GLM confirmed a positive correlation between the distribution of H. asiaticum and the presence of horse fresh feces, alongside a negative correlation with the proximity to water sources and donkey trails. Conclusions: This study reveals the strong spatial correlation between Przewalski's horses and H. asiaticum in desert grasslands, underlining the need to consider interspecific interactions in wildlife reintroductions. The findings are crucial for shaping effective strategies of wildlife conservation and maintaining ecological balance. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Crib-biting is a stereotyped oral behavior with poorly understood etiology and pathophysiology. The relationship between the gut microbiome and brain function has been described in behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety in humans. In horses, studies of behavioral problems and the microbiome are very limited. This study aimed to characterize the fecal microbiome and the predicted functional profile of horses with and without aerophagia. Fecal samples were collected from 12 Colombian Creole Horses of both sexes, divided into two groups: group 1, composed of six horses with crib-biting (3 females and 3 males), average body weight of 330 ± 10 kg, age of 7.0 ± 1.2 years and body condition score (BCS) of 5/9 ± 1 and group 2, consisting of six horses without crib-biting (3 females and 3 males), average body weight of 335 ± 5 kg, age 6.5 ± 1 years and BCS of 6/9 ± 1. From each horse in both groups fecal total DNA was obtained and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons were sequenced to characterize the bacterial community structure. Community structure and differential abundance analyses revealed significant differences between the two conditions (p < 0.05). Specifically, the fecal microbiota at the family level in crib-biting horses, showing a decrease in Bacteroidales and an increase in Bacillota and Clostridia, differed from that of healthy horses without crib-biting, consistent with findings from previous studies. Furthermore, metagenome prediction suggests metabolic profile changes in bacterial communities between both conditions in horses. Further studies are required to validate the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the etiology of crib-biting and other abnormal and stereotyped behaviors. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: The Franches-Montagnes (FM) is the last native horse breed of Switzerland, established at the end of the 19th century by cross-breeding local mares with Anglo-Norman stallions. We collected high-density SNP genotype data (Axiom™ 670 K Equine genotyping array) from 522 FM horses, including 44 old-type horses (OF), 514 European Warmblood horses (WB) from Sweden and Switzerland (including a stallion used for cross-breeding in 1990), 136 purebred Arabians (AR), 32 Shagya Arabians (SA), and 64 Thoroughbred (TB) horses, as introgressed WB stallions showed TB origin in their pedigrees. The aim of the study was to ascertain fine-scale population structures of the FM breed, including estimation of individual admixture levels and genomic inbreeding (FROH) by means of Runs of Homozygosity. Results: To assess fine-scale population structures within the FM breed, we applied a three-step approach, which combined admixture, genetic contribution, and FROH of individuals into a high-resolution network visualization. Based on this approach, we were able to demonstrate that population substructures, as detected by model-based clustering, can be either associated with a different genetic origin or with the progeny of most influential sires. Within the FM breed, admixed horses explained most of the genetic variance of the current breeding population, while OF horses only accounted for a small proportion of the variance. Furthermore, we illustrated that FM horses showed high TB admixture levels and we identified inconsistencies in the origin of FM horses descending from the Arabian stallion Doktryner. With the exception of WB, FM horses were less inbred compared to the other breeds. However, the relatively few but long ROH segments suggested diversity loss in both FM subpopulations. Genes located in FM- and OF-specific ROH islands had known functions involved in conformation and behaviour, two traits that are highly valued by breeders. Conclusions: The FM remains the last native Swiss breed, clearly distinguishable from other historically introgressed breeds, but it suffered bottlenecks due to intensive selection of stallions, restrictive mating choices based on arbitrary definitions of pure breeding, and selection of rare coat colours. To preserve the genetic diversity of FM horses, future conservation managements strategies should involve a well-balanced selection of stallions (e.g., by integrating OF stallions in the FM breeding population) and avoid selection for rare coat colours. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), Chrome (Cr), Lead (Pb), Iron (Fe) and Copper (Cu), in the blood, serum, tail and mane of horses from the industrialized area of Milazzo (Messina, Sicily), to understand the relationships between haematological parameters: Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), Haemoglobin (Hb), Haematocrit (Hct), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), Platelets (PLTs) and the concentrations of trace elements. Blood and hair samples from 20 healthy Italian Saddle horses and water, hay and concentrates samples were obtained to determine the haemogram and mineral concentration using a Thermo Scientific iCAP-Q ICP-MS spectrometer. Descriptive analysis showed a higher concentration of Zn, Cr, Pb, Fe, and Cu in the blood and a higher concentration of Cd in the tail than other substrates. A positive correlation was found for Cr (p < 0.0001) and Zn (p < 0.01) between blood and serum substrates, for Zn (p < 0.001) between mane and tail and for Pb (p < 0.01) between blood and mane, while a negative correlation was observed for Cr (p < 0.01) between blood and tail. Results showed a close relationship between the bioaccumulation of certain trace elements in biological substrates and haematological parameters, which represent useful biomarkers suggesting further studies, given the role of haematological parameters in athletic horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Currently, lack of standardization for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in equine practice has resulted in highly variable techniques, and there is no data on the bacterial metabolic activity or viability of the administered product. The objectives of this study were to compare the total and potentially metabolically active bacterial populations in equine FMT, and assess the effect of different frozen storage times, buffers, and temperatures on an equine FMT product. Fresh feces collected from three healthy adult horses was subjected to different storage methods. This included different preservation solutions (saline plus glycerol or saline only), temperature (-20 °C or -80 °C), and time (fresh, 30, 60, or 90 days). Samples underwent DNA extraction to assess total bacterial populations (both live and dead combined) and RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription to cDNA as a proxy to assess viable bacteria, then 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using the V1-V2 region. Results: The largest difference in population indices and taxonomic composition at the genus level was seen when evaluating the results of DNA-based (total) and cDNA-based (potentially metabolically active) extraction method. At the community level, alpha diversity (observed species, Shannon diversity) was significantly decreased in frozen samples for DNA-based analysis (P < 0.05), with less difference seen for cDNA-based sequencing. Using DNA-based analysis, length of storage had a significant impact (P < 0.05) on the bacterial community profiles. For potentially metabolically active populations, storage overall had less of an effect on the bacterial community composition, with a significant effect of buffer (P < 0.05). Individual horse had the most significant effect within both DNA and cDNA bacterial communities. Conclusions: Frozen storage of equine FMT material can preserve potentially metabolically active bacteria of the equine fecal microbiome, with saline plus glycerol preservation more effective than saline alone. Larger studies are needed to determine if these findings apply to other individual horses. The ability to freeze FMT material for use in equine patients could allow for easier clinical use of fecal transplant in horses with disturbances in their intestinal microbiome. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Fractures of the paracondylar process of the occipital bone may cause headshaking, neck pain and neurologic deficits. The condition is being recognised more frequently with increasing availability of computed tomography. However, to date only limited information is available as to presentation, treatment, surgical approach and outcome. Objectives: To describe the clinical signs, imaging findings, treatment, surgical approach and outcome in three horses diagnosed with paracondylar process fracture. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Clinical records and diagnostic images of affected cases were reviewed. Results: Two cases had ventral nonunion fractures—one of these presented with neck pain, headshaking and behavioural changes, while in the other the fracture was a suspected incidental finding in a case of poor performance. A third case with a more dorsal fracture presented with acute facial nerve paralysis. Diagnosis was by computed tomography in all cases, although imaging of ventral fractures by radiography was found to be feasible. Where clinical signs could be associated confidently with the fracture, conservative management resulted in improvement but not complete resolution. Repeated recurrence of clinical signs after prolonged periods of remission necessitated surgical removal in one case, which was readily accomplished with the aid of ultrasound guidance, and led to rapid resolution of clinical signs without significant post-operative complications. The surgical approach is described. Main limitations: Limited follow-up was available. Conclusions: Paracondylar process fracture should be considered as a differential diagnosis for headshaking, neck pain, poor performance and facial paresis, and is a justification for performing computed tomography in such cases. A multi-disciplinary approach is beneficial due to the potential for orthopaedic, neurologic, ophthalmologic and behavioural clinical signs, with additional need for expertise in diagnostic imaging and pain management. Surgical fragment removal should be considered for ventral fractures. © 2024 The Author(s). Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Human chiropractic is a well-established, evidence-based complementary medicine. Contrariwise, there is a lack of research on its impact on horses. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chiropractic treatment on healthy horses by measuring behavior, maximum temperature of the eyes (MaxTE), salivary cortisol (SC), and heart rate variability (HRV). Eight mares were selected and exposed to a 15-day habituation period. Then, they were randomly assigned to a grooming (GROOM) or chiropractic (CHIRO) session, performed by the same qualified chiropractor. The experiment was designed as a cross-over study and repeated after a 10-day washout (i.e., Week 1 and Week 2). During-CHIRO, the chiropractor treated and recorded joint hypomobility. During-GROOM, the mares were subjected to a standardized grooming session. MaxTE and SC were obtained before (T0), immediately after (T1), and one day after (T24) both sessions. In addition, before (Pre), during (During), and after (Post) both sessions, the mares were video recorded, and heart rate for HRV analysis was taken. Videos were analyzed using a specific ethogram and a Behavioral Discomfort Score (BDS) was obtained. Results showed that the mares manifested temporary signs of discomfort During-CHIRO, highlighted by an increase of ‘avoidance movements’ (p < 0.001) and ‘alert’ (p = 0.038). This was confirmed by an increase in BDS During-CHIRO (p = 0.044). No sympathetic shift was shown by MaxTE, SC, and HRV. A significant increase in the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) suggested a parasympathetic shift in Post-CHIRO (p = 0.040). Joint hypomobility tended to decrease between the first and second CHIRO (p = 0.09). Our results showed that equine chiropractic could be performed by a qualified veterinary chiropractor, leading to transient discomfort behavior, not accompanied by acute stress response. On the contrary, there seems to be a subsequent relaxation, demonstrated by an autonomic nervous system shift toward the parasympathetic branch. Consequently, chiropractic manipulation could be considered as an integrative treatment to improve the horses’ welfare. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Galician forests in northwestern Spain are subject to frequent wildfires with high environmental and economic costs. In addition, due to the consequences of climate change, these fires are becoming more virulent, occurring throughout the year, and taking place in populated areas, in some cases involving the loss of human life. Therefore, forest fire prevention is even more relevant than mitigating its consequences. Given the costs involved in forestry work, alternative measures to reduce fuel load and create vegetation gaps are needed. One involves grazing by an endemic species of feral horses (Equus ferus atlanticus) that feed on thicket-forming gorse (Ulex europaeus). In a 100-ha forest fenced study area stocked with 11 horses, four 50 m2 enclosed plots prevented the access of these wild animals to the vegetation, with the aim of manipulating their impact on the reduction of forest biomass. The measurement of biomass volumes is an important method that can describe the assessment of wildfire risks, unfortunately, high-resolution data collection at the regional scale is very time-consuming. The best result can be using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles - UAVs) as a method of collecting remotely sensed data at low cost. From September 2018 to November 2020, we collected information about aboveground biomass from these four enclosed plots and their surrounding areas available for horses to forage, via UAV. These data, together with environmental variables from the study site, were used as input for a fire model to assess the differences in the surface rate of spread (SROS) among grazed and ungrazed areas. Our results indicated a consistent but small reduction in the SROS between 0.55 and 3.10 m/min in the ungrazed enclosured plots in comparison to their grazed surrounding areas (which have an SROS between 15 and 25 m/min). The research showed that radar remote sensing (UAV) can be used to map forest aboveground biomass, and emphasized the importance and role of feral horses in Galicia as a prevention tool against wildfires in gorse-dominated landscapes. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Body conformation, including withers height, is a major selection criterion in horse breeding and is associated with other important traits, such as health and performance. However, little is known about the genomic background of equine conformation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use imputed sequence-level genotypes from up to 4891 German Warmblood horses to identify genomic regions associated with withers height and linear conformation traits. Furthermore, the traits were genetically characterised and putative causal variants for withers height were detected. Results: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for withers height confirmed the presence of a previously known quantitative trait locus (QTL) on Equus caballus (ECA) chromosome 3 close to the LCORL/NCAPG locus, which explained 16% of the phenotypic variance for withers height. An additional significant association signal was detected on ECA1. Further investigations of the region on ECA3 identified a few promising candidate causal variants for withers height, including a nonsense mutation in the coding sequence of the LCORL gene. The estimated heritability for withers height was 0.53 and ranged from 0 to 0.34 for the conformation traits. GWAS identified significantly associated variants for more than half of the investigated conformation traits, among which 13 showed a peak on ECA3 in the same region as withers height. Genetic parameter estimation revealed high genetic correlations between these traits and withers height for the QTL on ECA3. Conclusions: The use of imputed sequence-level genotypes from a large study cohort led to the discovery of novel QTL associated with conformation traits in German Warmblood horses. The results indicate the high relevance of the QTL on ECA3 for various conformation traits, including withers height, and contribute to deciphering causal mutations for body size in horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we analyzed the effects of including açaí kernel, in the experimental diets fed to horses on the intake and digestibility of their nutrient and the resultant effects on the behavior of horses. The experiments were conducted in Federal Rural University of Amazonia. Five mares with no defined breeds, were allocated to five treatments (the replacement of Mombaça grass (Megathyrsus maximus) with crushed açaí kernel at 0, 18.75, 37.50, 56.25, and 75% levels of dry matter), in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. The animals were housed in covered stalls with concrete floors, equipped with individual troughs and drinkers, and fed 80% roughage and 20% concentrate. The inclusion of açaí kernel altered the intake and digestibility of a few nutritional components and the feeding behavior of mares. Increasing levels of the substitution of Mombaça grass with crushed açaí kernel in the experimental diets increased the nutrient intake and digestibility of neutral detergent fiber, total carbohydrates, and non-fibrous carbohydrates (P < 0.05) while reducing the time spent on feeding by the animals. Crushed açaí kernel can, therefore, be included as a substitute for Mombaça grass at up to 37.5% in equine diets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the influence of breed (cob [CB] and non-cob [NC]), obturator type and surgical experience on the number of attempts, time taken and iatrogenic damage (ID) created when entering the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) tenoscopically. Study design: Prospective experimental cadaveric study. Animals: A total of 104 cadaver limbs. Methods: An equal number of randomly selected CB and NC limbs were operated using a conical obturator (OB) or a switching stick (SS) by one boarded (BS) and one resident surgeon (RS). Skin measurements, number of attempts and time taken to enter the DFTS were recorded. The DFTS was endoscopically examined and then dissected to record ID and cumulative ID calculated. Results: Mean CB skin thickness (8.4 mm) was nearly twice that of NC limbs (4.5 mm) (p <.001). Mean DFTS entry took longer in CB limbs (133 s) compared to NC limbs (112 s) (p =.02). BS mean entry time in CB limbs was 115 s compared to 46 s in NC limbs (p <.001). Cumulative ID was greater in CB limbs (25 of 52 limbs with ID) compared to NC limbs (14 of 52 limbs with ID) (p =.04). No difference was noted between obturators. Surgical experience reduced attempts and time entering the DFTS. Conclusion: Surgeons take longer to enter DFTS in CB limbs and more cumulative ID is created, regardless of obturator type used. Clinical significance: Skin thickness is a major determinant of time taken to enter the DFTS and increases the risk of ID. Awareness of the challenges in CB limbs is important. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: The horse owner and the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) are responsible for safeguarding horse welfare by ensuring the equipment being used is correctly fitted. The aim of this study was to investigate how saddle fit is assessed, managed, and acted upon by equestrian professionals. Participants (n = 483) completed an online questionnaire, which was split into three major sections: (1) participant demographics; (2) saddle fit for the horse; and (3) saddle fit for the rider. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal–Wallis, and univariable and multivariable analyses were performed (p < 0.05). Inductive content analysis identified themes from open-question responses. From the UK responses (n = 377), 184 saddle fitters, 77 therapists, and 116 coaches completed the survey. Compared to coaches, saddle fitters and therapists asked more frequently when their clients last had their saddle fitted (p = 0.0004). Saddle fitters typically assessed the saddle statically and dynamically vs. therapists, where it was dependent on the circumstances of the assessment (p = 0.0004). Saddle fitters experienced the saddle being out of balance more than therapists (p = 0.032) and made more alterations to the saddle than therapists and coaches (p = 0.0004). This study highlights opportunities for professions within the MDT to better support each other and horseowners to achieve improvements in overall fit for horses and riders. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (AL-DDFT) plays a crucial role in the stay apparatus of the horse. This study aimed to investigate the anatomical relationship between the AL-DDFT, the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), and other structures in the metacarpal region. Sixteen distal forelimbs from eight horses, aged 1 to 6 years, were evaluated through macroscopic, microscopic, and morphometric analyses, utilizing detailed dissection, E12 plastinated sections, and histological analysis. During lateral dissection, a connection was observed between the AL-DDFT and the SDFT. Histological evaluation revealed that this connection was a fibrous band (FB), extending the common synovial sheath (CSS) to the SDFT, along with associated collagen fibrils of the epiligament and peritenon. Additionally, two distinct forms of the AL-DDFT were identified, Type I and Type II, with Type II showing a greater cross-sectional area (CSA) than Type I. While numerous morphological and morphometric studies have explored the AL-DDFT and related structures, research incorporating plastination-based morphological and histological evaluations remains scarce. The findings provide valuable insights for both the morphological and clinical assessment of structures within the metacarpal region. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The use of grimace scales enables the clinical identification of changes in the facial expressions of animals caused by pain. The Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) is one such tool, comprising a pain coding system based on facial expressions and assessing six Facial Action Units (FAUs). Each FAU is accompanied by descriptions and anatomical details to assist the evaluator. However, the morphological descriptions for certain FAUs in the HGS are not sufficiently detailed, potentially hindering accurate interpretation. This study is an analytical investigation aimed at enhancing the morphoanatomical details in the HGS and providing raters with more comprehensive materials for pain evaluation in horses using this scale. To achieve this, detailed anatomical analyses were conducted using established references in veterinary anatomy. Initially, we propose substituting the term 'ear' with 'auricle' or 'pinna' and replacing 'area above the eye' with 'supraorbital region' for anatomical accuracy. Additionally, we introduce detailed morphoanatomical descriptions that identify specific landmarks, with the goal of ensuring more consistent application of the HGS and reducing interpretation variability. Furthermore, this study provides an explanation of the muscles involved in the investigated FAUs. These adjustments on the descriptions and evaluations remain unverified, however it is anticipated that the descriptive enhancements lead us to understand that higher interobserver reliability can be achieved for each of the FAUs. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Gait scores are widely used in the genetic evaluation of horses. However, the nature of such measurement may limit genetic progress since there is subjectivity in phenotypic information. This study aimed to assess the application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of breeding values for five visual gait scores in Campolina horses: dissociation, comfort, style, regularity, and development. The dataset contained over 5000 phenotypic records with 107,951 horses (14 generations) in the pedigree. A fixed model was used to estimate least-square solutions for fixed effects and adjusted phenotypes. Variance components and breeding values (EBV) were obtained via a multiple-trait model (MTM). Adjusted phenotypes and fixed effects solutions were used to train machine learning models (using the EBV from MTM as target variable): artificial neural network (ANN), random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR). To validate the models, the linear regression method was used. Accuracy was comparable across all models (but it was slightly higher for ANN). The highest bias was observed for ANN, followed by MTM. Dispersion varied according to the trait; it was higher for ANN and the lowest for MTM. Machine learning is a feasible alternative to EBV prediction; however, this method will be slightly biased and over-dispersed for young animals. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Hoof trimming and shoeing determine the horse’s hoof shape and balance. Hoof conformation plays a crucial role in limb biomechanics and can consequently prevent or predispose to injury. This study investigated the relationship between the morphometric characteristics of the horse’s hoof, specifically, the dorsal hoof wall angle (DHWA), the coronet band circumference (CBC), and lameness in 73 horses categorised as undertaking either show jumping, dressage, or riding school activities. Results from logistic regression indicated that horses with either a combination of acute DHWA with large CBC, or more upright feet with larger DHWA and smaller CBC have higher probabilities of lameness. Show jumping and dressage horses showed a higher prevalence of lameness. Hoof morphometry should be monitored, and podiatric interventions should be regularly scheduled for the maintenance of correct hoof conformation to prevent injury. This study suggests that an aligned hoof–pastern axis managed by a DHWA of around 50 degrees may prevent lameness, with special emphasis on horses in dressage and show jumping activities. On the other hand, we can also speculate that the disturbed axis alignment of DHWA may be a cause of lameness. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: EQUINE as the number colic is one a common cause of death issue among in the field equines. of equine The most medicine, common and types it is of considered colic are spasmodic and flatulent colic. Dealing with a case of colic requires accurate decision and timing in which acute phase proteins (APPs), coagulation profile and venous blood gases can help to achieve that beside keen physical examination. This study includes thirty-two Arabian horses, in which 10 healthy horses used as control group, six were suffering from spasmodic colic, and sixteen were suffering from flatulent colic. All horses expressing colic signs are evaluated between 2-5 according to Equine Acute Abdominal Pain Scale (EAAPS). Cases were clinically evaluated based on vital signs, intestinal borborygmi, nasogastric intubation, and rectal examination. Jugular blood samples were collected and tested for complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin, and venous blood gas (VBG) analysis. The results showed a significant decrease in red blood cells and hemoglobin contents in flatulent colic cases, a significant increase in serum D-dimer, and SAA concentrations with a significant decrease in fibrinogen in both groups. While haptoglobin showed no alterations in both groups. Venous blood gases showed a significant decrease in pCO2, HCO-3, and tCO2 in both colic groups along with a significant decrease in ionized calcium (iCa2+), and base excess with a significant increase in anion gap (AG) in the flatulent colic group compared to healthy group. Our conclusion indicates that SAA, serum D-dimer, and fibrinogen could be promising indicators of colic with no significant value in haptoglobin. ©2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

ABSTRACT: Background: Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a significant cause of surgery in adult horses presenting with colic pain. SBOs often require resection and anastomosis. While various techniques for intestinal anastomoses have been developed, it remains uncertain if any fully meet our clinical needs. Objective: To conduct a scoping review of publications on anastomosis techniques and outcomes for the treatment of SBO. Study design: Scoping review. Methods: A literature review was conducted using the CAB, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Peer-reviewed scientific articles in English, published between 1992 and 2023, were included. A quality assessment was performed for potentially eligible articles. Experimental studies, case reports, and case series with less than five cases were excluded and relevant data on study methods and sample size were extracted and charted from remaining articles. Anastomosis type and outcome were reported for articles considered potentially eligible for meta-analysis. Articles in which only overall outcome was reported or details on type of anastomosis were not reported were excluded for the final charting. Results: Of 3024 articles, 210 underwent a quality assessment. The most common study designs were case reports and case series (64.3%), followed by experimental studies (17.1%). After further exclusions, 104 articles met the inclusion criteria. In only 42 articles detailed data on type of anastomosis and relative outcome were reported. A total of 23 anastomosis types were reported for the treatment of SBO, with 6 different outcomes evaluated. Both short- and long-term survival rates consistently exceed 70% for all types of anastomosis (jejuno-jejunal, jejuno-ileal, and jejunocaecal). Main limitation: Non-English language studies and conference proceedings were excluded. Conclusion: The body of literature focused on surgical treatment for SBO exhibits low-quality evidence. Several techniques of anastomosis were described for different pathologies. However, there is a lack of homogeneity in reporting outcome for each surgical technique. Furthermore, outcomes considered varied significantly among studies and were sometimes poorly reported, although success rates are generally high. Overall, there is a need for better-structured studies on existing and commonly used techniques before comparing techniques and exploring other innovative approaches. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Horses maintained outdoors may experience a lower-allergenic environment compared to their stabled counterparts. This study hypothesizes that climatic changes in southern Brazil can influence respiratory status. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the lower airways of 17 horses from a teaching herd in southern Brazil, maintained outdoors, during winter, spring, and summer. Except for one mare with a history of severe asthma, all horses were considered healthy and underwent a physical examination. Airway endoscopic evaluation included scoring for tracheal mucus (0−5) and bronchial septum thickness (1−5). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at three time points, while bronchial septum biopsies were performed during spring and summer for airway epithelial investigation. Data analysis involved repeated measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05). Tracheal mucus score and septal thickness did not differ across investigation periods. In BALF cytology, the mean percentage of neutrophils was higher in spring than summer (7.9 ± 13.4 % vs. 4.5 ± 11.7 %, P = 0.037), and eosinophil count was higher in winter than spring (0.64 ± 1.29 % vs. 0.03 ± 0.13 %, P = 0.034) and summer (0.64 ± 1.29 % vs. 0.14 ± 0.60 %, P = 0.023). Histopathological observations showed no differences between time points, and no correlations were observed with BALF analyses (P > 0.05). This study demonstrates that, even in an outdoor environment, horses' airways exhibit cytological modifications associated with different seasons, indicating a need for deeper investigation; endobronchial biopsy did not contribute to the clinical diagnosis. © 2024

ABSTRACT: This study optimized the locations and sizes of wind-based distributed generators (WDGs) and solar photovoltaic-based distributed generators (PVDGs) to reduce the overall active power loss (OAPL) of an IEEE 85-bus distribution power system (DPS). Three metaheuristic algorithms, including the Wild Horse Optimizer Algorithm (WHOA), the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA), and the Transient Search Optimization (TSO) algorithm, were applied and compared to each other to identify the most effective method for finding the best value of OAPL. Based on the analysis, WHOA outperformed the other methods in achieving the best value of OAPL according to different criteria. Additionally, the effectiveness of WHOA was compared with previous studies, while WHOA also proved its strength in reducing overall losses, decreasing grid power, and improving voltage profiles. Moreover, the effectiveness of WHOA was tested for a 24-hour period with varying loads and the addition of PVDGs and WDGs. The results indicated that WHOA could successfully determine the optimal positions of both PVDGs and WDGs in Case 3, Case 4.1, and Case 4.2, achieving the optimal value of OAPL in the selected DPS, decreasing grid power utilization, and improving the voltage profile. In conclusion, WHOA proved itself to be an effective optimization tool for dealing with large-scale optimization problems. © 2024 Published by IRCS-ITB.

ABSTRACT: The present study focuses on the detailed description of postovulatory follicles (POFs) resorption and atresia in horse mackerel from Algerian waters. From February 2013 to February 2014, 155 female horse mackerel were randomly collected. Histological sections of ovaries were analyzed. Few POFs (7.28% of early POFs and 2.91% of old POFs of the total observed oocytes) were detected. Morphological changes of POF resorption were discussed in the current study. No particular shape was observed. Four types of atretic oocytes were determined: α = 34.38%, β = 5.28%, δ = 2.37% and γ = 0.94%, which was reported for the first time in horse mackerel. The incidence of α atresia was higher in the yolked (21.48%) than in the unyolked oocytes (12.89%). α atretic oocytes can be classified into two main types: non-bursting (capsulated, lipoidal and cystic atresia) and bursting (multiple bursts, single bursts, phagocytic bursts and liquified bursts). Further studies are required to better understand the reproductive strategies of fish in relation to postovulatory follicle resorption and atresia. © 2024 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With the emergence of COVID-19, there is an increased focus in human literature on cytokine production, the implications of cytokine overproduction, and the development of novel cytokine-targeting therapies for use during sepsis. In addition to viral infections such as COVID-19, bacterial infections resulting in exposure to endotoxins and exotoxins in humans can also lead to sepsis, resulting in organ failure and death. Like humans, horses are exquisitely sensitive to endotoxin and are among the veterinary species that develop clinical sepsis similar to humans. These similarities suggest that horses may serve as a naturally occurring model of human sepsis. Indeed, evidence shows that both species experience cytokine dysregulation, severe neutropenia, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and decreased perfusion parameters during sepsis. Sepsis treatments that target cytokines in both species include hemoperfusion therapy, steroids, antioxidants, and immunomodulation therapy. This review will present the shared cytokine physiology across humans and horses as well as historical and updated perspectives on cytokine-targeting therapy. Finally, this review will discuss the potential benefits of increased knowledge of equine cytokine mechanisms and their potential positive impact on human medicine. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Domestic horses could be bred for leisure activities and meat production, as is already the case in many countries. Horse meat is consumed in various countries, including Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and with the increase in this consumption, horses are registered as livestock by the Food and Agricultural Organization. In this study, horse meat microbiota of horse samples (n = 56; 32 samples from Kazakhstan and 24 samples from Kyrgyzstan) from two countries, Kazakhstan (n = 3) and Kyrgyzstan (n = 1), were investigated for the first time by next-generation sequencing and metabarcoding analysis. The results demonstrated that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla in all samples. In addition, three (5.4%) Staphylococcus strains were isolated from the Uzynagash region, Kazakhstan. Staphylococcus strains were identified as Staphylococcus warneri, S. epidermidis, and S. pasteuri by partial 16S rRNA DNA gene Sanger sequencing. All three Staphylococcus isolates were nonbiofilm formers; only the S. pasteuri was detected as multidrug-resistant (resistant to penicillin, cefoxitin, and oxacillin). In addition, S. pasteuri was found to carry mecA, mecC, and tetK genes. This is the first study to detect potentially pathogenic Staphylococcus spp. in horse meat samples originating from Kazakhstan. In conclusion, it should be carefully considered that undercooked horse meat may pose a risk to consumers in terms of pathogens such as antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus isolates. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, known for its famous Mongolian horses, faces significant environmental challenges due to the large-scale rearing of these animals, which produces a substantial amount of manure. If not managed effectively, this manure can lead to severe environmental pollution. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a small-scale intelligent aeration and heating composting system is effective in treating Mongolian horse manure, with the objective of enhancing composting efficiency and resource utilization to support sustainable agricultural development in the region. The equipment was utilized to treat a compost mixture of Mongolian horse manure and corn stover, allowing for an analysis of the changes in key indicators throughout the composting process. The results demonstrated that the equipment maintained high temperatures for up to eight days during the composting process, effectively inactivating pathogens and promoting the efficient decomposition of organic matter. The system also successfully controlled humidity to 12.7% and maintained oxygen concentration within the optimal range. Post-composting analysis revealed that the final compost contained 2.3% nitrogen, 1.3% phosphorus, and 1.2% potassium, with a pH of 6.4 and conductivity of approximately 5.2 mS/cm. Additionally, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio decreased significantly from 27.3 to 15.9, indicating substantial organic matter degradation. Seed germination tests showed germination rates of 80%, 86%, and 75% for corn, mung bean, and wheat, respectively, with a final seed germination index of 104%. This study concluded that the small aeration and heating composting equipment is highly effective in treating Mongolian horse manure, producing high-quality organic fertilizers that significantly enhance soil fertility and demonstrate considerable potential for supporting sustainable agricultural practices and improving environmental management in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of horse and donkey meat in the production of kaddid—a traditional dish typically not made with these meats—from a physical and chemical perspective. The results showed that both meats exhibit similar water retention during cooking, contributing to comparable tenderness and juiciness, with no significant differences in pH values, indicating similar quality (p > 0.05). However, their amino acid profiles differ: horse meat contains lower levels of glutamate (p < 0.05), methionine (p < 0.01), isoleucine (p < 0.05), and leucine (p < 0.05), but higher levels of proline (p < 0.05), histidine (p < 0.01), and lysine (p < 0.001) compared to donkey meat. Both meats provide essential amino acids. Horse meat is richer in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (32.44% and 39.58%, respectively), while donkey meat has a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (31.51%), with a more favorable PUFA/SFA ratio, suggesting better cardiovascular health benefits. In terms of dried meat, donkey kaddid has a higher protein (17.45 g/100 g) and lower fat content (2.1 g/100 g) compared to horse kaddid (16.7 g/100 g, and 3.5 g/100 g, respectively) (p < 0.05). These findings inform consumer choices and production practices, promoting the use of horse and donkey meat for kaddid production. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Theileria equi latently infected horses remain under oxidative stress which can be easily determined by evaluating the concerned biomarkers. Until now, very limited data are available regarding study of oxidative stress alongside hepatorenal biomarker alterations in carrier equids. Objectives: This study was aimed to investigate oxidative stress and hepato-renal alterations in respective biomarkers in latently T. equi-infected exotic and indigenous horses. Study design: The study involved 24 (n = 24) T. equi latently infected horses (11 exotic and 13 indigenous) while 50 horses (n = 50) served as the non-infected group. Haematological, hepato-renal and oxidative stress biomarkers analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of latent T. equi infection on these parameters. Results: In the T. equi-infected exotic horse group, significant decreases in Hb, PCV, TLC and eosinophils were observed in comparison with the T. equi-infected indigenous horse group. Blood glucose and SOD levels were significantly lower while serum MDA levels were significantly increased in T. equi-infected horses than the noninfected groups. Higher MDA levels are suggestive of biochemical changes in parasitised erythrocytes making their membrane rigid and liable to erythrolysis. Decreased SOD levels were indicative of a disturbance in anti-oxidative mechanisms leading to accumulation of free radicals attributing to oxidative injuries to T. equi-infected erythrocytes. Main limitations: Latently infected animals with very low parasitaemia which are unable to damage host cells may lead to false negative results. Another limitation is the difficulty in ruling out other similar disease-causing oxidative stresses. Conclusion: These observations indicated that T. equi naturally latently infected exotic horses were more liable to develop a condition in comparison to indigenous infected horses. From the above results, we can conclude that T. equi infection exerts a marked effect on the hepato-renal biomarkers and significantly affects the key antioxidant defence mechanisms of infected erythrocytes, leading to oxidative damage to the erythrocytes membrane and ultimately its haemolysis. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Tay-Sachs (TS) disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the α-subunit (HEXA) of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HexA). We report that (1) recombinant HEXA alone increased HexA activity and decreased GM2 content in human TS glial cells and peripheral mononuclear blood cells; 2) a recombinant chimeric protein composed of HEXA linked to two blood-brain barrier (BBB) entry elements, a transferrin receptor binding sequence and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, associates with HEXB in vitro; reaches human cultured TS cells lysosomes and mouse brain cells, especially neurons, in vivo; lowers GM2 in cultured human TS cells; lowers whole brain GM2 concentration by approximately 40% within 6 weeks, when injected intravenously (IV) to adult TS-mutant mice mimicking the slow course of late-onset TS; and increases forelimbs grip strength. Hence, a chimeric protein equipped with dual BBB entry elements can transport a large protein such as HEXA to the brain, decrease the accumulation of GM2, and improve muscle strength, thereby providing potential treatment for late-onset TS. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Diarrhea serves as a vital health indicator for assessing wildlife populations post-reintroduction. Upon release into the wild, wild animals undergo adaptation to diverse habitats and dietary patterns. While such changes prompt adaptive responses in the fecal microbiota, they also render these animals susceptible to gastrointestinal diseases, particularly diarrhea. This study investigates variations in fecal microorganisms and hormone levels between diarrhea-afflicted and healthy Przewalski’s horses. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the alpha diversity of the fecal bacterial community among diarrheal Przewalski’s horses, accompanied by notable alterations in taxonomic composition. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes emerge as dominant phyla across all fecal samples, irrespective of health status. However, discernible differences in fecal bacterial abundance are observed between healthy and diarrhea-stricken individuals at the genus level, specifically, a diminished relative abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio is observed. The majority of the bacteria that facilitate the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group (Christensenellaceae), NK4A214_group (Ruminococcus), Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group (Lachnospiraceae), [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group (Eubacterium), Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group (Lachnospiraceae), and Prevotellaceae_UcG_001 (Prevotella) are noted in diarrhea-affected Przewalski’s horses, while Erysipelotrichaceae, Phoenicibacter, Candidatus_Saccharimonas (Salmonella), and Mogibacterium are present in significantly increased amounts. Moreover, levels of immunoglobulin IgA and cortisol are significantly elevated in the diarrhea group compared with the non-diarrhea group. Overall, this study underscores substantial shifts in fecal bacterial diversity, abundance, and hormone levels in Przewalski’s horses during episodes of diarrhea. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Trypanosoma evansi (T. evansi) is a blood parasite, the causative agent of Trypanosomiasis (Surra) in many animal species primarily horses. In Indonesia, surra is a major disease of horses causing a catastrophic outbreak in Sumba Island killed thousands of horses during 2010-2012. Diagnosis of the disease is frequently based on parasitological technique. The aims of this study were to investigate T. evansi infection using both serological, parasitological and hematological techniques in horses in East Sumba. A total of 270 blood samples were randomly collected from both sexes of the healthy-looking animals for serum tested with Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT), and blood smear for detecting the presence of the parasite and for the leukocyte sub-population respectively. The results showed that 24.81% (67/270) of the samples were positive antibody to T. evansi antigen, and only 2.2% (6/270) of the serologically positive samples were also confirmed positive with the parasite. The leukocytes sub-population of the parasite-positive animals consisted of lymphocytes 60-98% (82.17 ± 14.43%), monocyte 0-4% (1.5 ± 1.76%), neutrophiles 0-40% (16.17±14.57%), eosinophils 0% and basophils 0-1% (0.17±0.41%) respectively. It was concluded that the seroprevalence of investigated animals were almost 25%, 2.2% of them suffered with parasitemia, lymphocytosis and neutropenia. This data suggesting a positive correlation between the applied tests, and it was considered as a novel diagnostic confirmation regarding Surra infection in the region. © 2024, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Intestinal microbiota (the gut microbiome) are important for normal gut function, especially in horses which rely on gut bacteria to break down plant material in the hindgut. Understanding normal microbiota is essential to be able to assess changes that occur during disease or in response to treatments. Post-mortem studies and biopsies have found different populations in the stomach mucosa (lining) compared to feces, but the gastric fluid has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to describe the gastric fluid microbiome of healthy horses over time, under two housing conditions, and to compare the gastric fluid to fecal microbiome of paired samples. We found that while there were fewer bacteria (taxa) identified in the gastric juice compared to feces, there was a stable population of gastric microbiota which did not vary from week-to-week under either housing condition. There was a significant difference in compositional diversity (the relatedness of taxa present) between housing conditions, with changes in the relative proportions of a few key groups when horses moved from pasture to stable. These findings are important to inform future investigations of the gastric fluid microbiota in horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To compare the ability of bioreactance noninvasive cardiac output (BR-NICO) with thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO) for the measurement of cardiac output (CO) in healthy adult horses receiving 2 different IV volume replacement solutions. Design: Prospective randomized crossover study from September to November 2021. Setting: University teaching hospital. Animals: Six university-owned adult horses. Interventions: Horses were randomly assigned to receive 7.2% hypertonic saline solution (HSS) or 6% hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4) solution (HETA). BR-NICO and TDCO were measured simultaneously at baseline, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 minutes before fluid administration and again at the same times after starting a bolus infusion of IV volume replacers. All solutions were administered within 10 minutes. Measurements and Main Results: BR-NICO and TDCO were strongly correlated (Pearson r2 = 0.93; P < 0.01). Regression analysis showed the relationship between TDCO and BR-NICO was BR-NICO = 0.48 × TDCO + 0.6. For the corrected BR-NICO values, the Bland–Altman agreement mean bias and lower/upper limits of agreement were −0.62 and −5.3 to 3.9 L/min, respectively. Lin's concordance (95% confidence interval) between methods was 0.894 (0.825–1.097). Compared with baseline, HSS increased the CO at 10 and 20 minutes (TDCO and BR-NICO). Compared with baseline, HETA decreased the CO at 10 and 20 minutes (TDCO and BR-NICO) and increased the CO at 90 (TDCO only) and 120 minutes (TDCO and BR-NICO). Conclusions: BR-NICO strongly agreed with TDCO in the measurement of CO in healthy unsedated adult horses. HSS administration significantly increased CO in the first 30 minutes, while HETA initially decreased CO at 10 minutes but increased CO to above baseline values by 90 minutes. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: The survival of horses diagnosed with critical colic (requiring referral or euthanasia) relies on rapid and effective decision-making by the owner and veterinary practitioner. Objectives: To explore UK horse owners' and veterinary practitioners' experiences of decision-making for critical cases of equine colic. Study design: Qualitative study using a phenomenological approach. Methods: Individual, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 14 horse owners and 13 veterinary practitioners (vets) who had experienced a critical decision (referral or euthanasia) for a horse with colic. A purposive, convenience sample of participants was recruited. Sessions explored participant's experience of colic, including recognition, help-seeking behaviour, and challenges. Thematic analysis was performed on collected data. Results: Four over-arching themes were identified; ‘head’, ‘heart’, ‘practicalities’ and ‘impact’. Owners acknowledged responsibility for their horse's welfare but had different perspectives than vets on the importance of finance (‘head’). Both vets and owners described how the horse–human relationship (‘heart’) often led to conflict during decision-making. The vet–client relationship was influential on decision-making for both owners and vets; involving other people in decision-making was described both positively and negatively by participants (‘heart’). ‘Practicalities’, such as lack of preparedness, transport issues and adverse weather conditions, were identified by both owners and vets as barriers. Owners described a ‘rollercoaster’ of emotions after a critical decision, with profound impacts on their mental wellbeing, feelings of guilt, and long-term changes in behaviour (‘impact’), and a lack of support to manage these feelings. Main limitations: Small sample size. Conclusions: This study describes stakeholder decision-making during critical cases of equine colic. Factors that commonly influenced decisions included an owner's previous knowledge and beliefs, social pressures, logistics and the relationship between the owner and vet. The study highlighted long-term impacts on the owner, including their management and decisions for subsequent horses. These factors should be considered in shared decision-making. © 2024 The Author(s). Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is no objective information reporting the effect of unilateral laser ventriculocordectomy (VeC) on arytenoid abduction or stability. Objectives: To evaluate arytenoid stability and abduction in horses with severe recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) before and after unilateral laser VeC. Study design: Prospective cohort. Methods: Eight horses with grade C or D exercising laryngeal function that underwent unilateral laser VeC were included. Exercising endoscopy was performed before and ≥6 weeks after left-sided laser VeC. Arytenoid stability at maximal exercise was calculated by measuring the left-to-right quotient angle ratio (LRQ) of the corniculate processes at the points of maximal arytenoid abduction (expiration) and maximal arytenoid collapse (inspiration). For each horse, means of measurements obtained for four breaths pre- and post-operatively were used for statistical analysis. Results: The difference in LRQ between inspiration and expiration was lower post-operatively (median 0.039; interquartile range [IQR] 0.032–0.047) compared with pre-operatively (median 0.158; IQR 0.083–0.249; p = 0.01) confirming the left arytenoid was more stable following unilateral laser VeC. The degree of improvement was significantly greater for grade D horses compared with grade C horses (p = 0.04). The LRQ measured on maximal abduction was also lower post-operatively (median 0.467; IQR 0.444–0.506) compared with pre-operatively (median 0.578; IQR 0.554–0.655; p = 0.02) indicating the left arytenoid was less abducted following surgery. Main limitations: The sample size was small, no racehorses were included and post-operative assessment was conducted at a variable time after surgery. Conclusion: Unilateral laser VeC in grade C and D RLN-affected horses results in slightly reduced left arytenoid abduction but increased arytenoid stability. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The present study evaluated the clinico-physiological and haemato-biochemical parameters in 12 native breed horses, irrespective of age and sex, using two different total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) triple drip combinations, viz. xylazine, ketamine and guaifenesin (XKG group); and dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and guaifenesin (DKG group). Sedation in both groups was achieved with acepromazine and butorphanol, with xylazine used in the XKG group and dexmedetomidine in the DKG group, followed by ketamine induction and maintenance with the respective TIVA protocols. During different time intervals in the pre, peri and post-operative periods, both groups were assessed for clinico-physiological, haematological and biochemical parameters. The results showed that horses in the DKG group showed balanced and better cardiopulmonary and haemato-biochemical changes when compared to XKG group. © 2024 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

ABSTRACT: Dynamic nasopharyngeal collapse (NPC) is an obstructive upper airway disease that affects mainly the inspiratory phase of respiration in horses undergoing strenuous exercise. It occurs when the neuromuscular activity of the nasopharynx is overwhelmed by the intense negative pressures generated during exercise. This leads to collapse of at least one of the four components of the nasopharynx which is comprised of the two lateral walls, the dorsal roof and the ventral soft palate. As a result, the airway diameter and thus airflow become compromised. Even small changes in the airway diameter produces profound increases in negative inspiratory pressure, perpetuating the cycle of collapse. Compared to other dynamic upper respiratory tract disorders, the amount of literature on NPC as a disease entity is limited. The exact pathophysiology of NPC is unknown; however, it impacts up to one quarter of high-performance equine athletes presenting for poor performance. There is currently no definitive treatment for this severely performance-limiting condition. Thus, the prognosis for future athletic prognosis is guarded, with most horses being retired from racing or athletic use in general. Further research is warranted in this field to reduce the impact of disease and in turn, reduce the turnover rate and economic loss by enhancing the career longevity of elite equine athletes diagnosed with NPC. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The objectives of the present study were to analyze the influence of the stallions employed in the Dülmen wild horses on the genetic diversity and population substructure using Bayesian cluster analysis. The Dülmen wild horse is maintained as a unique horse population exposed to the natural conditions all year round in the Merfelder Bruch near Dülmen in Westphalia, Germany. Stallions selected for breeding have to prove their abilities to survive under this harsh environment. We used multilocus genotypic information from a set of 29 autosomal microsatellites to determine the paternity of 185 male foals sired by nine stallions. As females could not be sampled, we could not make inferences on all yearlings and test whether there are differences in the genetic population parameters between both sexes. The mean number of progeny was 19.92 with a range of 2–32, caused by the length of the service period per stallion. The average observed and unbiased expected heterozygosity was 0.688 and 0.631, the mean number of alleles was 4.448, and Wright’s FIS was −0.173. Pairwise genetic distances (FST and Nei’s unbiased genetic distances) were significant and varied between 0.038 to 0.091 and 0.085 to 0.290, respectively. Neighbor-joining dendrogram plots clustered a large proportion of the paternal progeny groups in different branches. Posterior Bayesian analyses using seven paternal half-sib groups with 10–74 members supported a maximum of six clusters, with two paternal progeny groups not differing, and a median of five clusters, with two groups of two sires each falling into the same clusters. When sires were employed in non-consecutive years, progeny from these different years of the same sires were grouped in the same cluster, whereas the progeny of one sire from two consecutive years were in different clusters. We were able to distinguish male progeny from Dülmen wild horse stallions and to show the effects of stallion use on the genetic substructure in the Dülmen wild horse herd. In conclusion, the analyses showed the genetic potential of the Dülmen wild horse stallions to maintain a high genetic diversity and also the effects in which breeding seasons and for how long stallions are used to sire foals. The selection of stallions may be sensitive for the further development of genetic diversity and preserve this closed population as a valuable resource for further studies on the evolution of the horse. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Eight geldings weighing 544 ± 16 kg were used to evaluate feeding a postexercise protein meal on plasma amino acids during recovery. Horses were fed sweet feed, corn, grass hay and equal amounts of a protein pellet (32% CP) with meals (MP group) or postexercise (EP group). Horses exercised 1–2 h/day, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks. A pre and poststudy 4 days total urine and feces collection was conducted. Urine and fecal samples were analyzed for nitrogen (N) to calculate N balance. Blood samples were drawn immediately after and at 1 and 3 h postexercise at the start and end of the study for plasma amino acid concentrations. Absorbed N and N retention were greater for the MP group compared to the EP group (p = 0.038, 0.033 respectively). An interaction revealed an increase in fecal N (p = 0.01) and decreased N digestibility for the MP group compared to the EP group at the end of the study. Plasma concentrations for 8 out of 14 amino acids were less for the EP group immediately after exercise compared to the MP group (p < 0.02). Plasma concentrations of lysine and arginine were greater for the EP group compared to the MP group at 1 and 3 h after exercise (p < 0.05 and 0.04 respectively). Changes were different for 8 out of the 14 amino acids immediately post exercise, 7 out of 14 amino acids at 1 h postexercise and 10 out of 14 amino acids at 3 h postexercise with positive changes for the EP group and negative changes for the MP group. The EP group had improved supply of plasma amino acids in the recovery period that sustained for 3 h postexercise and are indicative of better amino acid supply supporting muscle development. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Due to the growing interest among veterinarians and the increasing market demands, the development of equine cardiology is necessary. Currently, veterinary medicine for companion animals needs to catch up to human medicine—equine medicine included. A common condition in older horses is aortic valve regurgitation resulting from fibrosis, while its more severe form occurs in younger horses or develops due to a bacterial infection. Mitral valve regurgitation, especially dangerous due to the possibility of sudden death, has a better prognosis if the horse has valve prolapse. Tricuspid valve regurgitation usually does not pose a clinical problem, although its severe cases may lead to heart failure. Some pathologies can be treated surgically, which requires excellent knowledge of anatomy. The object of this study consisted of twenty domestic horse hearts. The focus was on the normal and comparative anatomy of the left and right subvalvular apparatus. The number of muscular bellies of the papillary muscles and the type of connection of the muscles were analysed. Moreover, the height of muscle originating from the ventricle wall was determined, the morphological regularity of the papillary muscle was assessed, and the chordae tendineae originating from the papillary muscles were examined. The conducted research allowed for comparing domestic horses with different species through other studies, the authors of which described this particular aspect. Interspecies similarities which may be correlated with the evolutionary relatedness, as well as differences that could reflect adaptation to different lifestyles, environmental conditions, or metabolic requirements of the animals, have been found. This study expands the knowledge of animals’ normal and comparative anatomy, and contributes to the development of veterinary surgery, internal medicine, and biology. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this research was to describe the variation in breeding practices in the population of Arabian horses in Algeria in relation to the population size drop observed in the 2000s, due to an increase in the cost of food and a change in interest in racing, related to the black decade. As a result, the breeders had to face two opposite constraints: enhancing reproduction to counter the population decline and preventing the loss of genetic diversity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the genetic consequences of the decisions taken over a period of 30 years, starting from 1988 to 2018. The study was based on the analyses of the stud-book and on 11 microsatellite markers in a group of 943 horses, distributed into 13 age classes. Between 2004 and 2008, the breeders purchased foreign sires and dams, allowing a relative stability in unbiased heterozygosity of about 71%, due to the high genetic distances between foreign and local horses. As these importations stopped from 2009 on, there was a decrease in allele numbers of about 20%. Moreover, from 2010 on, we observe an excess of inbreeding and an increase in genetic drift relative to the starting population, due to population size decline. From the analysis of genetic distances between local individuals, it seems that the only constraint for sires and dams allowed to mate was a null coefficient of inbreeding.  © 2024 Ahmed R.

ABSTRACT: Background: Trigeminal-mediated headshaking is a neuropathic facial pain condition in horses. No treatment has been entirely successful. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used in human medicine as a treatment for various neuropathic pain conditions, and good results have been achieved in cases of trigeminal neuralgia. Objectives: Apply rTMS to horses with trigeminal-mediated headshaking (TMHS) and to evaluate tolerability, application of the setting, and success rate. Animals: Seventeen horses with nonseasonal signs of TMHS. Methods: Other underlying causes of headshaking were ruled out. The rTMS was performed under standing sedation on 5 consecutive days applying 3 sets of 500 stimulations each, with a stimulation strength of 5 Hz. Horses were evaluated on Day 1 (t0) and Day 5 (t1) of the treatment and 2 (t2) and 4 weeks (t3) afterwards using a special scoring system. Results: The rTMS was well tolerated. Headshaking signs during exercise were decreased by 70% (Day 5; t1). Four weeks after rTMS, signs were still decreased (mean reduction of 50%) during exercise. Improvement of mean resting and exercise scores was significant (P <.05) and effect sizes between pretreatment and all time points after treatment (t1, t2, t3) were large (>±0.8). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be a promising treatment for neuropathic pain and headshaking in affected horses. Pain-free periods after treatment differ individually, and repeated treatment may be necessary. More studies should be performed to determine ideal settings for horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Equine-assisted intervention (EAI) studies deal with clients, whereas very few studies focused on the effects on animals. EAI equids are also submitted to management, which influences their welfare. Management and working conditions depend on human decisions and perception. We gathered information through a survey about facilities managers’ strategies (n = 51) and obtained direct information on management and working practices and their consequences on equids’ welfare through an observational study (n = eight facilities, 174 equids). Differences in managers’ perceptions of good management practices were related to the facility’s involvement in EAI, e.g., increased awareness of equids’ needs (housing and feeding), especially when EAI was the main activity. A detailed observational study on eight additional facilities confirmed that. Facility management profiles were paralleled by equids’ welfare profiles. Clear correlates were found between management decisions and welfare consequences. One major factor influencing welfare and human–equid interactions appeared to be working modalities, with more EAI facilities practicing groundwork and bitless work. Facilities where equids were the most involved in mixed activities had the most equids with compromised welfare. Given EAI clients’ particularities, conventional working modalities are less adapted and at risk of increased discomfort for equids. Overall, survey and observational approaches converged but some discrepancies (choice of equid type) appeared between the reported and observed prevalence. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: There has been little investigation into the health patterns of the eventing horse population outside veterinary clinics. To target health problems in the eventing horse population, it is important to determine the relative impact of different health problems. The objectives were to describe the prevalence and patterns of lameness/illness in registered British eventing horses. An online survey was released for all horses registered with British eventing in 2018. Data were collated and descriptive analyses undertaken. A total of 1677 surveys were completed, among which 49.4% reported a previous lameness/musculoskeletal problem, 26% being in the previous six months. The most frequently reported musculoskeletal problems were in the foot (421), joints (382), wounds (340), back (333), ligament (205), tendon (213), bones (140) and muscles (135). The most frequent non-musculoskeletal problems related to the skin (183), gastric ulceration (173), colic (145) and infection (88). Injuries to the hoof sole/muscles/tendons were most frequently sustained in competition, suspensory ligament/splint bone/stifle/tarsal injuries were more frequently sustained in training and abscess/foot penetration at rest. DDFT injuries were most frequently out of training for >12 months, SDFT/stifle/suspensory ligament for <12 months, tendon sheath/splint bone for <3 months and tarsal/sole bruising/abscess for <2 weeks. A greater understanding of injuries/illnesses frequently sustained could be useful for veterinarians working with event horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horse gram is a relatively unexplored legume with a plethora of nutritional benefits, a high protein content, inherent resilience to biotic and abiotic stress, and adaptability to climate change. This legume, with its myriad advantages, has yet to gain importance nationally and internationally in terms of its genetic improvement and popularization. In this chapter, we attempt to appeal to the altruistic traits of this underutilized legume by underlining its significance in terms of nutraceutical properties, sustenance as a feed and fodder, high protein content and health benefits. The chapter includes deliberation on the origin and distribution of horse gram, gene pool and genetic stocks available in the wild species and relatives, germplasm collection, characterization and conservation, utilization of the germplasm through conventional plant breeding approaches and advanced molecular techniques such as mapping and genome editing, its cultivation practices and gene erosion due to interference such as environmental depletion and varietal replacement. The chapter ends with a focus on the need for collaborative efforts between different stakeholders and policy makers to allow this potential legume to flourish and stand on the global stage to support nutritional security. © CAB International 2024.

ABSTRACT: The implantation of unicortical cortex screws in the proximal hole of locking compression plates (LCP) has been recommended for proximal interphalangeal (PIP) arthrodesis in horses to prevent fractures resulting from stress risers in the proximal phalanx (P1). However, this cortex screw fixation technique may limit efficient dorsal compression of the PIP joint by the plate, potentially affecting the stability of the construct. In this study, we aimed to measure stress and strain in P1 and the plate using an ex vivo model of PIP arthrodesis in horses. We employed various implantation methods and proximal screw types in conjunction with two 5.5 mm transarticular cortex screws. Ten pairs of equine forelimbs were divided into four groups based on proximal screw placement: GUC (unicortically placed cortex screw), GBC (bicortically placed cortex screw), GUL (unicortically placed locking screw), and GBL (bicortically placed locking screw). We calculated the magnitude and direction of strain, strain ratio, and stress using strain gauges during an axial compression mechanical testing. The palmar surface of P1 exhibited higher stress and strains than the dorsal surface, with the plate part located at the articular level suffered more stress than the proximal part. Both the implantation method and proximal screw type significantly influenced the analyzed parameters. The GUC promoted greater changes in strain direction in the proximal portion of the P1. Bicortical placement of a cortex screw appears to be the most suitable option for filling the proximal hole of the LCP, because it allows effective dynamic compression via the plate and prevents abrupt shifts in the direction of the forces acting on the proximal part of P1 during loading. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to conduct molecular investigation and potential risks associated with Streptococcus equi infection in horses with upper respiratory tract infection. For this aim, sixty-nine horses were used (50 diseased and 19 apparently healthy). Horses under investigation were subjected to clinical examination and bacteriological investigation of nasal swabs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for confirmatory identification of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi came to match the isolation percentage on its selective medium. For Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, sodA and seeI genes were detected at molecular weights of 235 bp and 520 bp, respectively. There was a significant (P value <0.05) association between breed, use, vaccination, number of affected animals in the premises, over-crowding and climatic conditions and the isolation frequency of Streptococcus equi subspecies Equi infection. The highest percentage of isolation was recorded in Arabian horses (32/53; 60.4%) compared with other breeds (21/53; 39.6%). Horses kept for racing or showing revealed higher isolation percentage (32/53; 60.4%) compared with draft horses that showed isolation percentage of (21/53; 39.6%). Vaccinated horses also showed a higher rate of isolation (29/53; 54.7%), compared with non-vaccinated ones (24/53;45.3%). The results of the present study highlighted the potential risk factors associated with S. equi subspecies equi in horses with upper respiratory tract infection. The present finding may support the authorities to construct strict preventive measures for this infection. © 2024, Assiut University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Animal Medicine.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate the preservative properties of alga Gelidium sp. flour when included in the glazing medium employed for the frozen storage (−18 °C) of horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus). Different concentrations (low, medium, and high) of an aqueous extract were tested and compared to a control water-glazing condition. Quality changes (lipid oxidation and hydrolysis, fatty acid (FA) profile, and trimethylamine (TMA) formation) were determined after 3- and 6-month storage periods. A general quality loss (lipid oxidation with hydrolysis development and TMA formation) with the frozen storage period was detected in all samples. The presence of an alga flour (AF) extract in the glazing medium led to a lower (p < 0.05) TBARS and fluorescent compound formation and to higher (p < 0.05) polyene values in frozen fish. Furthermore, a preserving effect on free fatty acids was detected in AF-treated fish. On the contrary, the AF-glazing treatment did not affect (p > 0.05) the TMA formation and the total n3/total n6 FA ratio. In general, preservative effects were found to be higher in frozen fish corresponding to the medium concentration tested. Current results show the potential of Gelidium sp. flour as a natural source of preservative hydrophilic compounds for the quality enhancement of frozen horse mackerel. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to assess the changes of pro-inflammatory interleukins in 10 horses subjected to road transport practices (distance of 150 km) from the training site (Messina, Sicily) to the competition centre in Syracuse (Sicily). Blood sampling and interleukins analysis were performed during a round trip transportation (transport 1 and transport 2). In particular, blood samples were collected before the transport took place (Pre), five minutes later (Post) and one hour later (Post 1 h), for each transport, in order to assess the serum concentration of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-6. The results showed that the serum concentration of IL-1α decreased at Post and Post 1 h compared to the values obtained at rest condition (P < 0.05). The other interleukins analysed (i.e. IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-6) showed increased levels at Post than Rest and Post 1 h in transport 1 (P < 0.05). In transport 2 the analysed parameters showed no change throughout the analysed time points (P > 0.05); however, higher levels of IL-1α at Pre and higher IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-6 values at Post were found in transport 1 than transport 2 (P < 0.05). The increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines after transport 1 suggests the triggering of the inflammatory event and this may show that, although horses are animals accustomed to transport, this is a stressful event that could activate the well-orchestrated inflammation cascade, albeit physiological and temporary, as highlighted by the lower serum concentrations of the investigated interleukins found in transport 1 than transport 2 and by the lack of significant differences in the serum concentrations of the investigated interleukins among the time points of transport 2. It must be taken into account that enrolled animals are well-trained and healthy athletic horses participating to a jumper competition, thus, such inflammation did not occur thanks to a good balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines which allowed a prompt restoration of homeostasis eventually impaired by the stressful event. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: A 10-year-old Irish Sport Horse gelding developed complications from a general anesthesia resulting in sling support and recurrent urinary catheterization. The horse subsequently presented signs of dysuria and pollakiuria, was diagnosed with sabulous cystitis, and developed a urethral stricture from the repeated catheterizations, which was confirmed on urethroscopy. Clinical signs persisted despite conservative management with topical corticosteroids and urethral bougienage with balloon dilators. An image-guided approach was used to treat the stricture with a custom-made polydioxanone stent placed in the urethra after which the horse was able to void normally and fully empty his bladder. Repeat urethroscopy and ultrasonography 6 months after the procedure showed the stent to have completely reabsorbed with urethra remaining patent. Nineten months after the procedure, the owner reports the horse remaining at his intended level of athletic performance with no dysuria. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This article describes the development of the pathogenic dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), which is the causative agent of Equine epizootic lymphangitis (EEL), from the mycelial form in the soil to the yeast form in the horse. In this study, the stages and morphology of HCF were identified through histopathological analysis and culture with various samples collected in Ethiopia from 15 horses showing clinical signs of EEL. In equids, especially cart horses in Ethiopia, poor-quality harnesses cause cutaneous wounds, which often attract flies facilitating the transmission of the fungus. Also, HCF infection occurs through open wounds or ocular mucous membranes when horses roll on contaminated damp soil. Respiratory histoplasmosis can occur through inhaling fungal spores, which is rare. HCF microconidia enter the lungs and skin wounds and are phagocytized by tissue-resident macrophages. The spores undergo intracellular replication within the macrophages transitioning into yeasts. The infected macrophages undergo lysis releasing pathogenic yeast cells into the surrounding tissue. Consequently, yeast-rich purulent exudate is produced, contaminating the soil in stables where yeast cells germinate into the mycelial form, and the entire process starts from the beginning. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies have shown a highly positive effect of physical exercise on the overall condition of the body. The observed changes occur at the cellular level - proliferation, oxidative respiration, ROS degradation, whole-organism homeostasis improvement and ageing inhibition. The longevity regulating pathway is a broad term encompassing all the biochemical actions that contribute to keeping the organism in good condition and prolonging life duration. The overall aim of the present study was to describe the correlation between intensive physical activity and the expression of genes involved in biochemical processes related to longevity. A group of n=10 Arabian horses taking part in an endurance ride for 120 km were included in the study. Blood samples from the horses were taken before and after the ride to perform comparative analyses of the transcriptome profiles. Using high-Throughput NGS and bioinformatics tools, the group of 9 genes with the highest up- and downregulation fold change (FC) rates were identified: PTEN, IRS2, SESN2, CCND1, TBC1D1, FOXO1, KL, TP53, and SOD2. The results of this study could lead to the identification of a genetic marker for hot-blooded horse breeding.  © 2024 Grzegorz Myćka et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: The objectives of this study were (a) to detect zoonotic gastrointestinal pathogens in faecal samples of horses using the FilmArray® GI Panel and (b) to identify variables potentially associated with their presence. Faecal samples collected from 224 horses obtained during a countrywide study in Greece were tested by means of the BioFire® FilmArray® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel, which uses multiplex-PCR technology for the detection of 22 pathogens. Gastrointestinal pathogens were detected in the faecal samples obtained from 97 horses (43.3%). Zoonotic pathogens were detected more frequently in samples from horses in courtyard housing (56.0%) than in samples from horses in other housing types (39.7%) (p = 0.040). The most frequently detected zoonotic pathogens were enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (19.2% of horses) and Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli stx1/stx2 (13.8%). During multivariable analysis, two variables emerged as significant predictors for the outcome ‘detection of at least one zoonotic pathogen in the faecal sample from an animal’: (a) the decreasing age of horses (p = 0.0001) and (b) the presence of livestock at the same premises as the horses (p = 0.013). As a significant predictor for the outcome ‘detection of two zoonotic pathogens concurrently in the faecal sample from an animal’, only the season of sampling of animals (autumn) emerged as significant in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.049). The results indicated a diversity of gastrointestinal pathogens with zoonotic potential in horses and provided evidence for predictors for the infections; also, they can serve to inform horse owners and handlers regarding the possible risk of transmission of pathogens with zoonotic potential. In addition, our findings highlight the importance of continuous surveillance for zoonotic pathogens in domestic animals. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Organisms that nest in ant-defended trees presumably benefit from ants deterring potential enemies. How birds build a nest while surrounded by ant workers and how the ants are kept away from the fledglings are unknown. In Costa Rican dry forests, two bird species (streak-backed oriole, Icterus pustulatus, and yellow-olive flycatcher, Tolmomyias sulphurescens) preferentially nest in Pseudomyrmex ant-defended swollen-thorn acacias (Vachellia) and build the entire nest with fungal rhizomorphs. We tested whether rhizomorphs alter acacia ants' behaviour as a potential mechanism to deter aggressive ants from the birds’ nests. We also tested whether water increased the properties of the fungus, because birds nest during the rainy season. Hence, we recorded detailed observations of ant behaviour after contacting plant fibres (control) and dry and wet rhizomorphs. After touching the rhizomorphs, the probability of grooming and speeding up was higher (>65%) than after contacting plant fibres (<30%). Some ant behaviours were never observed with the plant fibres but had a higher probability of occurring (∼16–67%) after the ants touched rhizomorphs: gaster curling, biting a nestmate, spinning and wandering erratically. Water did not enhance putative rhizomorph properties. The results indicate signs of alarm, repellence and intoxication after interacting with rhizomorphs. Therefore, birds may benefit from using fungal rhizomorphs as it may deter the ants from entering the nest. This finding opens a venue for research questions, including whether the fungus effects are specific to acacia ants or can be generalized to other social hymenopterans that the birds choose to live nearby (e.g. wasps) or need to keep away from the nest (e.g. army ants). © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a common procedure for evaluation of the equine lower airways. Time to resolution of post-BAL inflammation has not been clearly defined. Hypothesis: Residual inflammation, evident by changes in immune cell populations and inflammatory cytokines, will resolve by 72 hours after BAL. Animals: Six adult, healthy, institution-owned horses. Methods: Randomized, complete cross-over design. Each horse underwent 3 paired BALs, including a baseline and then 48, 72, and 96 hours later, with a 7-day washout between paired BALs. Each sample underwent cytological evaluation and cytokine concentrations were determined by a commercially available multiplex bead immunoassay. Statistical analysis was performed by multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis. Data are reported as marginal means and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Neutrophil, eosinophil and mast cell percentages were not significantly different at any time points. Macrophage percentages were higher at 72 hours (45.0 [95% CI, 41.6-48.4]%) and 96 hours (45.3 [95% CI, 42.9-47.7]%) vs baseline (37.4 [95% CI, 33.5-41.4]%; P <.001 and P =.01, respectively), and at 72 hours and 96 hours vs 48 hours (31.9 [95% CI, 28.1-35.6]%; P <.001). Neutrophil percentage was not significantly increased at 48 hours (P =.11). Interleukin (IL)-6 concentration was increased at 72 hours (5.22 [95% CI, 3.44-6.99] pg/mL) vs 48 hours (4.38 [95% CI, 2.99-5.78] pg/mL; P <.001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Significant lung inflammation was not detected at 72 and 96 hours, suggesting that repeating BAL at 72 hours or more can be done without concern of residual inflammation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Ganzi horse is distributed in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. As we all know, this region on the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau is characterized by low oxygen levels, low atmospheric pressure, and intense ultraviolet light. The extreme environment causes the genomic variation of plateau animals for environmental adaptation. At present, the genetic diversity and the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation of Ganzi horses remain unclear. Here, an extensive genetic analysis was conducted utilizing whole-genome sequencing data from 145 individual horses. The analysis of autosomal genetic diversity confirmed that Ganzi horses had experienced low intensity artificial selection and had high genetic diversity. Examination of mitochondrial DNA information from whole-genome sequencing data revealed multiple maternal origins for Ganzi horses. Further, four different selective scanning methods were used to identify positive selected genomic regions and genes associated with high-altitude adaptation. We identified genes associated with altitude adaptation at selection windows in Ganzi horses, such as EPAS1, ABTB2, RHOQ, and TMEM247. Notably, EPAS1 and OR52A1J gene exhibited high select signal values, different nucleotide diversities, and haplotype patterns, and missense mutations in EPAS1 (A > T) and OR52A1J (C > T) were found to be more frequent in high-altitude horses. Moreover, our research illuminated significant gene flow between Ganzi and Chaidamu horses, which may be related to the formation of Ganzi horses. In general, these findings not only enhance our understanding of this unique native breed but also further our understanding of Ganzi horse's high-altitude adaptation. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Sex chromosomal abnormalities are a well-established cause of reproductive failure in domestic horses. Because of its difficult diagnosis, the Pura Raza Español breeding program established a routine screening for chromosomal abnormalities in all the horses prior to enrolling in the studbook. This genomic procedure combines an initial assessment based on the results from Short Tandem Repeat (STR) parentage testing followed by a Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) based copy number aberration (CNA) confirmative analysis in positive cases. Using this methodology, we identified five new individuals carrying a 65,XXY chromosomal number aberration (CNA) among 27,330 foals enrolled over the past two reproductive seasons. The animals were initially flagged as CNA candidates due to abnormal results in STR testing. Subsequent analysis genotyping using an STR sex-linked dedicated panel and a medium-density SNP array in ECAX and ECAY confirmed the diagnosis as 65,XXY carriers. Four cases (upon sample availability) underwent further analysis using in situ fluorescent hybridization with ECAX and ECAY probes, showing identical results. Phenotypic analysis revealed abnormal gonad development in one of the cases, showing that the remaining four had a normal reproductive morphology. To our knowledge, this represents the largest number of horses exhibiting the equine form of Klinefelter syndrome (65,XXY) reported to date. Our study highlights the importance of genomic screening in the accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities in horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Meat adulteration is a growing concern for consumers and researchers, necessitating the development of a simple and robust method for identifying animal sources in meat products. In this study, a double-tailed recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) integrated with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based two-color lateral flow nucleic acid hybridization strip (LFNAHS) was established for simultaneous detection of pork and horse meat. Magenta and cyan gold nanoparticles functionalized with specific probes and Raman dyestuff were used to color the LFNAHS based on RPA amplification products. The assay successfully detected colored test lines for horse and pork adulteration, with quantitative analysis achieved through Raman intensity measurements. The method showed a high specificity with no cross-reactivity and a detection limit of 0.01 % (wt%). Authenticity testing of 40 donkey products yielded results consistent with PCR-agarose gel electrophoresis. This assay can be extended to identify other meat sources by replacing the specific primer sets. This versatile method can be adapted for identifying other meat sources, making it a valuable tool for accurate, sensitive, and quantitative meat authentication in resource-limited settings. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Insulin dysregulation (ID), core to equine metabolic syndrome, may present without obesity. Testing for ID risk is commonly based on breed and obese phenotype but might be valuable for non-obese stock-type horses. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ID in non-obese stock-type horses and evaluate if morphometric neck measurements (MNM) correlate with ID. Sixty-two, non-obese (BCS 5, range 2.5-6/9) stock-type horses were assessed for MNM: neck circumference at 25%, 50% (NC50), and 75% (NC75) length, and crest height. An oral sugar test (OST; 0.15 mL/kg BW corn syrup) was performed with blood taken pre- and 60 min post-OST for insulin (PREI, POSTI) and glucose (PREG, POSTG). Insulin dysregulation was defined as insulin concentration > 45 µIU/mL POSTI. Three of 62 horses were ID (4.8%; 95% CI 1.0%-13.5%). Horses with ID had greater PREG (121.0 ± 7.56 vs. 105.3 ± 1.72 mg/dL; LS means ± SEM; P = 0.04) and PREI (15.7 ± 2.63 vs. 10.5 ± 0.59 µIU/mL; P = 0.05) than normal responders. Mares had greater PREI than geldings (11.7 ± 0.76 vs. 9.4 ± 0.89 µIU/mL; P = 0.04). Stepwise regression indicated a weak relationship with crest height and POSTG (y = 51.27 + (0.88 x NC50); R2 = 0.09; P = 0.02). Post-glucose correlated with NC50 (r = 0.30; P = 0.04) and NC75 (r = 0.29; P = 0.03). This study showed 4.8% of non-obese horses had ID, warranting testing irrespective of phenotype, but only a weak association between MNM and POSTG was found. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Although respiratory distress is encountered infrequently in equine practice, it can be serious and potentially fatal, requiring immediate and decisive intervention. History and physical examination can often give sufficient clues to identify the cause of respiratory distress and initiate emergency treatment. Ultrasonography can also be invaluable when assessing distress caused by lower respiratory tract issues. Upper respiratory tract obstruction, tension pneumothorax and occasionally pulmonary oedema can be rapidly fatal and require immediate intervention by emergency tracheotomy, thoracocentesis and evacuation of pleural air or administration of furosemide and oxygen, if available. Acute severe asthma and substantial pleural effusion are often not an immediate threat to life but nonetheless require fast intervention including administration of bronchodilators and corticosteroids or pleurocentesis, respectively. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of diamond burr debridement (DBD) for the treatment of calcific band keratopathy (CBK) in horses. Methods: Medical records from horses with CBK were reviewed over a period of 4 years. Diagnosis of CBK was based on slit-lamp examination findings, and DBD was performed on standing sedated horses. Follow-up was obtained by clinical reevaluation of the treated eyes or a telephone survey with the referring veterinarian. Results: Twenty-two horses of different ages (median: 11 years; range: 5–23) representing 24 CBK-affected eyes (14 left eyes and 10 right eyes) were included in the study. The patients had a medical history of chronic and recurrent uveitis, which required repeated long-term treatments with various combinations of ophthalmic corticosteroids. DBD alone cleared the cornea in 22 affected eyes (92%), but it was combined with blade scraping in two cases with thick calcium plaques. The postoperative medication included a topical antibiotic, atropine drops, and oral flunixin meglumine. Corneal healing was achieved in 21 eyes (87%), 5–21 days (median time 13 days) postoperatively. The three remaining horses were lost to follow-up. Recurrence occurred in 5 of the 21 (24%) reexamined eyes, 3–12.5 weeks (median 8 weeks) postoperatively, and required a second DBD. Four of the 21 eyes ended up being enucleated due to sequelae of uveitis. The main limitations of the study include those inherent to all retrospective clinical data collections. Conclusion: Mechanical DBD can readily and safely clear the cornea in horses with CBK, but recurrence of calcium deposition is possible. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: Abdominal ultrasonography is an important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of colic, yet primary care equine veterinary practitioners are often limited by availability and access to low-frequency (2–5 MHz curvilinear array or sector) abdominal transducers. Use of high-frequency (5–10 MHz linear array) transrectal transducers has not previously been compared with use of abdominal transducers for transcutaneous abdominal ultrasonography. One recent pilot study established that there was no significant difference in organ detection by the two transducers on the right side of the equine abdomen, but the stomach, liver and kidney on the left side were less likely to be detected using the transrectal transducer in healthy horses. A clinical study found that the transrectal transducer can be used successfully using the FLASH protocol in horses presenting with colic, with high-quality images that detected abnormalities of the peritoneal fluid, small intestine and large intestine. The transrectal transducer had decreased visualisation of the stomach and left kidney and was less likely to detect pathology surrounding these organs. This is the first series of studies to evaluate use of transrectal transducers in abdominal ultrasonography of the horse, a tool that is readily accessible to the field practitioner. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: Horses used for antisera production are repeatedly hyperimmunized to produce high levels of specific antibodies. This prolonged process can lead to various health issues, including amyloidosis, which involves the accumulation of amyloid proteins in organs and tissues, potentially causing organ dysfunction and failure. These horses are often retired when they no longer produce adequate antibody levels. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of prolonged antisera production on the health of retired horses by examining their blood biochemistry and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, which are indicators of systemic inflammation and organ damage. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 12 horses for this study. Nine horses were retired antiseraproducing horses that had been discontinued for 2 years, while three healthy non-antisera-producing horses were used as controls. These twelve horses were divided into four groups based on the duration of their active period as antisera producers (never been used, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, and 6-7 years). We measured key blood biochemistry parameters and SAA levels to evaluate the health status of the horses. Results: Total protein, fibrinogen, and globulin levels were elevated, whereas other parameters remained normal. The findings indicate that despite normal SAA levels, the horses exhibited signs of ongoing health issues related to their previous use in antisera production, such as increased total plasma protein, fibrinogen, and globulin levels, as well as the presence of amyloid deposits in vital organs such as the liver and kidneys, as observed in post-mortem examinations. Conclusion: Despite normal SAA levels, retired antisera-producing horses showed elevated total protein, fibrinogen, and globulin levels, indicating ongoing health issues. © 2024 Veterinary World.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of prolonged administration of the oral NSAIDs phenylbutazone and firocoxib on concentrations of cytokines and growth factors in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and autologous protein solution (APS). ANIMALS 6 adult University owned horses. METHODS Horses were randomized to receive phenylbutazone (1 g, orally, q 12 h) or firocoxib (57 mg, orally, q 24 h) for 6 days. Blood was obtained and processed for APS (Pro-Stride) and PRP (Restigen) before the administration of NSAIDs and at 7 days (1 day following cessation of NSAIDs). Horses underwent a two-week washout period, during which blood was obtained at 14 days and 21 days. The protocol was repeated with a crossover design. PRP and APS were analyzed for concentrations of platelets, leukocytes, and several cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α) and growth factors (PDGF, FGF-2, and TGF-β1) using immunoassays. Plasma was evaluated for drug concentrations. RESULTS No significant differences existed in concentrations of growth factors and cytokines before or after prolonged administration of NSAIDs. There were significant differences in concentrations of leukocytes and platelets in PRP compared to APS, with higher concentrations of leukocytes at the day 7 time point (T) in APS (phenylbutazone) and in concentrations of platelets in APS at T0 (firocoxib) and in APS at T7 (phenylbutazone). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Veterinarians can recommend the administration of these oral NSAIDs prior to obtaining blood for PRP and APS provided a single-day washout period is instituted. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are mostly saturated fatty acids with a methyl branch at the penultimate or antepenultimate position to the CH3 end. Very-long-chain BCFAs (C ≥ 20) are uniquely found in surface lipids. Human and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) are the only two species that possess vernix at birth, and vernix particles carry loads of BCFA to the gut, potentially influencing the establishment of the first microbiota. Horse (Equus caballus) contains high levels of BCFA in its surface lipids, and the current study aims to investigate if BCFA are components of a neonatal foal's gut. Electron ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used to distinguish iso- and anteiso-form of BCFA from straight-chain fatty acids. Abundant very-long-chain iso-BCFA, mainly even-numbered iso-20:0, iso-22:0, iso-24:0, and iso-26:0 were found in horse meconium but not in their manure collected a few months later. There are little differences in BCFA types and concentrations between foal manure and adult manure. Moderate to high levels of very-long-chain anteiso-BCFA were also found. Comparisons of horse meconium BCFA to horse skin cholesterol ester BCFA content and to meconium from human and sea lion suggest its skin derived origin. The study expands our knowledge on the gut nutritional environment of a newborn horse, and further study is needed to establish the relationship between gut BCFA and microbiota composition in the first few hours of life. Practical Applications: Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) are bioactive compounds found in vernix caseosa, the lipid-laden material covering the surface of a newborn baby. BCFA also reaches high concentrations from the third trimester of gestation until birth. However, the exact functionality and mechanisms of BCFA in the surface and gut of a fetus remain unclear. The current study aims to clarify the lipid conditions in the gut of newborn foals and to identify the associations between BCFA in the gut and on the skin at a critical point when the horse's microbiota establishes itself. The findings of the current study lay a path for studying the physiological functions of BCFA in horse models, potentially accelerating research related to BCFA. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Potential arrhythmias recorded by cardiac monitors using the built-in human algorithm are as follows: total number of episodes, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and the percentage of time spent in atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. Long-term use of an insertable cardiac monitor (loop recorder) has been reported in one horse earlier, but its accurate role as a diagnostic tool is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term applicability of the Reveal XT cardiac monitor for recording cardiac arrhythmias in adult horses. The Reveal XT cardiac monitor was implanted in 12 horses under sedation in standing position. Median duration of data recording calculated for the population was 1,169 days. The number of false positive detections of asystole and bradycardia was extremely high in all horses. For atrial fibrillation, false positive detection occurred in five and false negative detection occurred in one horse. The present study showed that the long-term use of the Reveal XT cardiac monitor is feasible, well-tolerated and the devices work reliably, without complications. The human algorithm could not be used for automatic detection of arrhythmic episodes in the study population. The device could detect atrial fibrillation in horses, but the recorded AF burden was inaccurate and the stored ECGs had to be manually interpreted. Because the human analyser algorithm of this cardiac monitor fails to identify bradyarrhythmias in horses based on our results, this instrument is not capable for accurately determining the aetiology of episodic collapse in this species. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With the constant growth of technology and pollution caused by urban expansion, heavy metal contamination has become an alarming concern. The performance of Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) technology in immobilizing heavy metal has been demonstrated by several researchers. While various studies have successfully isolated ureolytic bacteria from a variety of sources, there are very limited studies that have focused on isolating them from local waste sources, specifically Greywater and Horse Faeces for MICP application, which benefits in terms of economical, sustainability, and efficiency for engineering purposes. The study aims to investigate the effect of urease-producing bacteria derived from Greywater and horse faeces on heavy metal immobilization. The methods include collecting waste samples, isolating and subculturing of ureolytic bacteria, testing the physiological characteristics of ureolytic bacteria, examining the tolerance test and evaluating heavy metal removal efficacy through Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) analysis, and last but not least, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses of morphological and mineralogical properties of biominerals formed after heavy metal immobilization treatment. The study found that bacteria from Greywater were more effective at heavy metal immobilization than those from Horse Faeces. Additionally, AAS analysis indicates the greywater-derived bacteria from the residential area sample's exceptional competence in Cd2+ removal, with a significant 80.19% removal rate exceeding the horse faeces bacteria sample's removal rate of 65.26%. The morphological analysis confirmed the presence of heavy metal carbonate in treated heavy metal samples, as well as presenting insight into the effectiveness and application of local ureolytic bacteria's potential for heavy metal toxicity degradation. ©Copyright Afandi.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the hematological, physiological and biochemical alterations of quarter and crossbred horses subjected to vaquejada tests in semiarid regions and to determine the welfare conditions of the animals in these competitions. We evaluated 18 pure and crossbred Quarter horses, males and females, with ages ranging from two to 13 years and an average live weight of 476.5 kg, divided into three groups (animals in early training, animals in an intermediate phase and animals considered fit for competition). Four samples were collected at 30-day intervals. The physiological, hematological and biochemical parameters were measured at two time points: before, with the animal resting, and immediately after the vaquejada test simulation. The experimental design was subdivided into plots that were repeated over time (three types of training, two moments and four collections). The results were subjected to analysis of variance, and the means were compared via Tukey's test at 5% significance. There was an effect of the moment of collection on the respiratory rate, hematocrit and glucose concentration. There was a marked increase in heart rate, approximately 25%, from the first collection to the subsequent collection, which remained constant until the last collection. The heart rates of the animals remained constant, but immediately after the test, the average heart rate of the animals at the beginning of training was lower than that in the other phases. More research is needed to determine the time at which physiological and biochemical parameters return to normal patterns and to predict possible injuries in the conditioning of horses participating in the vaquejada. © 2024 Malque Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Background: The modified Meek technique is not commonly used in equine wound management, despite the consistent reliable and superior results compared with other grafting techniques. Major drawbacks are the need for specialised, expensive equipment and general anaesthesia. Objectives: To describe adjustments of the modified Meek technique enabling use in the standing horse without the need for the full equipment. This implied the use of full-thickness skin grafts manually harvested from the pectoral area and manually cut into micrografts. Graft acceptance; healing progress; and final functional and cosmetic result were outcome parameters. Study design: Descriptive case series. Methods: Eight horses with traumatic wounds at the dorsal side of the carpus or tarsus, healing by second intention, were treated. Original wound areas and areas of graft acceptance and rejection were determined from post-processing of digital photographs and percentage acceptance, wound contraction and epithelialisation were calculated. Results: The initial mean wound area was 55.4 cm2. Graft acceptance was 95.3 ± 2.5%. Wound closure was due to 46.0 ± 25.6% wound contraction and 54.0 ± 25.6% epithelialisation and resulted in 96.8 ± 1.9% reduction of the initial wound area 28.0 ± 8.5 days after grafting. The scar was flat, flexible and functional, usually with thin and regular hair growth. The adapted procedure was fast and efficient, with a learning curve for the increased manual work. Main limitations: Small study population. Conclusions: This adapted modified Meek technique can successfully be performed in the standing horse and obviates the need for the full expensive equipment and general anaesthesia. The acceptance of the full-thickness grafts is excellent resulting in fast and satisfactory healing. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The use of prohibited substances in horse racing is a major concern that jeopardizes both the fairness of competitions and the health of horses. This problem can stem from the use of licensed drugs for animal health, as well as unlicensed substances. Horse doping laboratories monitor the potential use of these substances in racehorses within the framework of regulations set by the International Federation of Horse Racing Authority. In this context, sildenafil and its major metabolite n-desmethyl sildenafil were detected in a post-race horse urine sample sent to the Pendik Veterinary Control Institute Doping Control Laboratory through a screening analysis performed with Liquid Chromatography Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry. These results were confirmed by Q Exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry and follow-up analyses were performed. As a result of these analyses; simultaneous detection of 9 metabolites in horse urine was reported, two of them for the first time. In addition, the pioneer and comprehensive data resulting from this study provide preliminary data for future studies and anti-doping analyses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Viscoelastic monitoring of horse coagulation is increasing due to its advantages over traditional coagulation testing. The use of a point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation monitor (VCM Vet™) has been validated for use in horses using native whole blood (NWB) but has not been assessed using citrated whole blood (CWB), a technique that might have advantages in practicality and precision. Blood was collected from 70 horses, tested in duplicate immediately using NWB (T0), and stored at room temperature as CWB for testing in duplicate at 1 (T1) and 4 (T4) hours after venipuncture for comparison to NWB. Of these horses, 20 were classified as clinically healthy and used to determine reference intervals for CWB at 1 and 4 h post-collection. There were clinically relevant differences in all measured viscoelastic parameters of CWB compared to NWB meaning that they cannot be used interchangeably. These differences were not consistent at T1 and T4 meaning the resting time of CWB influences the results and should be kept consistent. The use of CWB in this study also resulted in more machine errors when compared to NWB resulting in measurements that might not be interpretable. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Finnhorse is Finland's native and national horse breed and it has genetic affinities to northern European and Asian horses. It has historical importance for agriculture, forest work and transport and as a war horse. Finnhorse has four breeding sections in the studbook and is under conservation and characterisation efforts. We sequenced and annotated the genome of a Finnhorse mare from the working horse section using PacBio and Omni-C data. This genome can complement the existing Thoroughbred reference genome (EquCab 3.0) and facilitate genetic studies of horses from northern Eurasia. We assembled 2.4 Gb of the genome with an N50 scaffold length of 83.8 Mb and the genome annotation resulted in a total of 19 748 protein coding genes of which 1200 were Finnhorse specific. The assembly has high quality and synteny with the current horse reference genome. We manually curated five genes of interest and deposited the final assembly in the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession no. PRJEB71364. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This article provides, firstly, an overview of Arctic traditional horse herding as one of the Indigenous subsistence practices of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). It discusses the origins, characteristics, and spiritual and material importance of Sakha horses and horse herding practices to inform the overall understanding of this traditional subsistence activity, which remains largely unexplored. Secondly, by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews with Indigenous Sakha horse herders, this study explores the ways in which Indigenous subsistence practices are evolving and reacting to the climate and environmental changes. Results show that climate change is altering the local ecosystem and introducing new challenges to communities in Central Yakutia. Local herders describe climate change as a complex interplay of diverse transformations rather than a singular phenomenon. While historical adaptation strategies relied on the flexibility of traditional practices, today, this flexibility is often hindered by non-climatic factors. This article further discusses adaptability of Indigenous practices to climate change and offers recommendations for their development, particularly traditional horse herding. Future research related to climate change and Arctic Indigenous communities should encompass deeper and broader aspects, covering historical, cultural, social, and economic contexts and the worldviews of Indigenous peoples, distinct from Western perspectives. © 2024 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Anthropomorphizing can misinform the making of inferences about animal mental experiences. This is a consideration when implementing the Five Domains Model for animal welfare assessment. An online survey run in 2021 captured horse sector participants’ perspectives about anthropomorphism and wellbeing in relation to horses. Most respondents, 82.9% (n = 431/520), believed that anthropomorphism could influence horse welfare and wellbeing. These respondents were then asked how, in their opinion, anthropomorphism might relate to horse welfare. A thematic analysis identified two themes: (1) ‘Anthropomorphism can influence how people relate to horses’ and (2) ‘Anthropomorphism can have consequences for horse welfare and wellbeing’. The results suggested that experienced respondents were aware of the complexities surrounding anthropomorphic attitudes and that anthropomorphism can have beneficial and detrimental consequences on horse welfare and wellbeing. Benefits include a sense of relatedness to a horse, while detriments include the potential to misinterpret horse behaviors. The authors propose that anthropomorphism has a place in horse welfare and wellbeing when used critically and with caution. This study recommends that there is a need to actively manage anthropomorphism when organizations update policies and practices and implement the Five Domains Model. More research is required to understand the effects of anthropomorphism on horse-related practices. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: To seek appropriate veterinary attention for horses with colic, owners must recognise early signs. Direct observation of horse behaviour has several drawbacks: it is time-consuming, hard to see subtle and common behavioural signs, and is based on intuition and subjective decisions. Due to recent advances in wearables and artificial intelligence, it may be possible to develop diagnostic software that can automatically detect colic signs. Objectives: To develop a software algorithm to aid in the detection of colic signs and levels of pain. Study design: In vivo experiments. Methods: Transient colic was induced in eight experimental mares with luteolytic doses of prostaglandin. Veterinarians observed the horses before and throughout the interventions and assigned pain scores which were used to separate colic episodes into none (pain score ≤5), level 1 (pain score 6–10) or level 2 (pain score ≥11). Accelerometric data and videos were collected throughout the experiments and using accelerometric data, the horse's behaviour was classified into normal and 10 pain-related behaviours and an activity index was calculated. Models were designed that utilised behaviour and activity index characteristics both detecting the presence of colic and assessing its severity. To determine the accuracy of the model, the ground truth, that is the veterinarians' observation of colic signs and assessment of pain level, was compared with the automatic detection system. Results: The cross-validation analysis demonstrated an accuracy of 91.2% for detecting colic and an accuracy of 93.8% in differentiating between level 1 colic and level 2 colic. The model was able to accurately classify 10 pain-related behaviours and distinguish them from normal behaviour with a high accuracy. Main limitations: We included a limited number of horses with severe pain related behaviours in the dataset. This constraint affects the accuracy of categorising colic severity rather than limiting the algorithms' capacity to identify early colic signs. Conclusions: Our system for early detection of colic in horses is unique and innovative, and it can distinguish between colic of varying severity. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ancillary diagnostic methods to enhance the accuracy of viability assessment have not been established for use in clinical practice. Objectives: To assess intestinal microperfusion measured by Laser Doppler Flowmetry and Spectrophotometry (LDFS) in naturally occurring small intestinal strangulations of different origins and to compare this between viable and non-viable segments. Study design: Prospective clinical trial. Methods: Forty horses undergoing colic surgery for naturally occurring small intestinal strangulations were included. Tissue oxygen saturation (tSO2), haemoglobin (tHB) and blood flow (tBF) were determined by LDFS before and after release of the strangulation. Intestinal biopsies were taken in cases that underwent intestinal resection or intraoperative euthanasia and assessed using a semi-quantitative mucosal injury score (MIS). The LDFS measurements were compared between the different categories of strangulation causes and histopathological injury using parametric and non-parametric tests (p < 0.05). Results: Strangulations by pedunculated lipomas had lower tBF (13.9 ± 18 arbitrary units [AU]) than epiploic foramen entrapments (65.2 ± 61 AU; CI −1.697 to −0.2498; p = 0.005). Segments with MIS > 5 showed lower tBF during strangulation than segments with MIS < 4 (mean difference 61.1 AU; CI −1.119 to −0.07361; p = 0.03). This did not differ significantly following release of strangulation. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the inflammatory cell count and tBF during strangulation (r 0.34; CI 0.01 to 0.60; p = 0.04). The tSO2 and tHB did not differ between the different categories of lesions or injury. Main limitations: No biopsies could be taken from the intestinal segments that did not undergo resection. The duration of strangulation could not reliably be ascertained. Conclusions: Blood flow measurements in naturally occurring strangulating lesions show a varying degree of ischaemia in different causes of strangulation. Intestinal blood flow measurements prior to release of the strangulation could potentially contribute to the identification of mucosal injury, yet a high individual variability and other contributing factors need to be considered. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A 3-year-old Quarter Horse gelding originating from Texas presented for fever and inappetence. An encapsulated, mixed echogenic cranial mediastinal mass visible ultrasonographically in the left and right fourth intercostal space that displaced the heart caudally was identified. Histological evaluation of needle biopsies obtained under general anaesthesia revealed a severe pyogranulomatous inflammatory process associated with intralesional round, 15–25 μm in diameter, thick double-contoured cell wall fungal structures. Sequencing of products obtained from DNA extracted from the paraffin-embedded biopsy sample and a panfungal PCR assay targeting the large ribosomal unit region had a 99.1% identity to either Coccidioides immitis or C. posadessii. Bronchoscopy revealed purulent exudate in the right primary bronchus. Cytological evaluation of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) contained 96% moderately degenerative neutrophils and 4% macrophages. Fungal structures were not appreciated in the BALF. However, the mediastinitis could have resulted from inhalation and dissemination of arthroconidia through lymphatics or directly from the lung parenchyma. Quantitative immunodiffusion of serum for the presence of coccidioidal IgG antibodies yielded a titre of 1:256 suggestive of disseminated coccidioidomycosis. After oral fluconazole for 24 months, the horse's general health and athletic performance had returned to normal and the mediastinal mass was not appreciated sonographically. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Pantoea agglomerans is a gram-negative bacterium that usually lives in symbiosis in soil and plants. However, it may also lead to serious diseases in plants, animals and humans. We describe a case of aspiration from dysphagia associated with the isolation of P. agglomerans in a horse admitted to an Italian hospital. The patient was presented to the hospital for the onset of chronic cough after an acute episode of pulmonary hemorrhage during a race recorded two months before and was treated with dexamethasone and penicillin. The cough was accentuated during meals, leading to a suspicion of aspiration from dysphagia. A bronchoalveolar lavage was collected, and cytological examination showed the presence of vegetable fibers, rod bacteria, and a high macrophage population (89%). From the tracheal wash collected for bacteriological culture, P. agglomerans was isolated in monoculture, and the antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed that the isolate was susceptible to all tested antimicrobials except sulfonamide. The horse recovered well after 10 days of enrofloxacin treatment. The present report highlights the role of P. agglomerans as an opportunistic respiratory pathogen in horses, especially in the presence of plants or their parts. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Fetal age in Quarter Horses can be predicted within 2 weeks from 100- to 200- days of gestation using femur length, biparietal diameter (cranium diameter) and eye approximated volume. However, as pregnancy advances, the femur and cranium become too large to be imaged in their entirety using ultrasound and the corresponding biometric parameters can no longer be measured. In this longitudinal study, the proximal phalanx (P1) was evaluated as a novel biometric parameter for late gestation to predict fetal age and bone maturation. Transrectal ultrasound was performed in ten pregnant mares with known ovulation dates, every two weeks from 240- days of gestation until parturition. P1 was imaged in 69 % of the examinations. Inability to image P1 was due to obstructive positioning such as carpal or fetlock flexion, or posterior presentation of the fetus. Advancing fetal age did not affect visibility of P1. P1 length correlated significantly with days of gestation and a correlation equation was established: y = 0.3837x -69.55 where y is the predicted value of P1 length and x is the day of gestation (with day 0 being the day of ovulation). When P1 length was equal to or larger than the width of the ultrasound image (52.5 mm), 90 % of mares (9/10) were above 300- days of gestation. Ossification of the proximal and distal epiphysis of P1 typically appeared between 277- and 303 -days of gestation (mean: 288 days). The proximal epiphysis did not close before parturition whereas the distal one closed between 306- and 333-days of gestation (mean: 320 days). P1 epiphyseal appearance and closure occurred chronologically reflecting bone maturation. Radiographic findings at birth and prenatal ultrasound findings were in agreement, apart from timing of P1 distal epiphyseal closure. In conclusion, P1 length can be used as a new fetal biometric parameter to assess fetal age and growth after 240- days of gestation. The knowledge of P1 bone maturation process in utero as a marker for fetal bone development, may also be valuable in clinical decision-making when considering inducing parturition in the mare. © 2024

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To optimize and evaluate methods for the detection of the inflammatory biomarkers myeloperoxidase (MPO) and calprotectin (CP) in equine feces by ELISA. ANIMALS Healthy horses (n = 28) and horses with intestinal inflammation (n = 10). METHODS Feces were suspended in buffer to create fecal supernatant. Serum and fecal supernatant were analyzed using ELISA kits validated for the detection of MPO and CP in equine serum. Assay validation steps included intra-and interassay variability (coefficient of variation [CV]), dilution linearity, spike recovery, and sample type correlation. Variations in sample handling protocols (centrifugation speed, extraction buffer, and filtration) were evaluated. RESULTS 17 paired fecal and serum samples were used for initial analysis (10 healthy horses, 7 colitis). Previously reported sample handling protocols resulted in detectable MPO and CP but poor CV, linearity, and spike recovery. There was a linear correlation between serum and fecal samples for CP but not MPO. There was a significant difference between the concentration and CV of alternative sample handling protocols for CP and MPO, with improved CV for CP (2.1% to 18.6%) but not MPO (14.4% to 53.4%). Processing fresh feces with a fecal extraction buffer and filtration of supernatant resulted in the best CV (0.5% to 3.8%) and recovery (45% to 64%) for CP. Detection of MPO was inconsistent regardless of method. CLINICAL RELEVANCE There are few reliable diagnostic modalities for inflammation of the equine large colon. Findings support quantification of CP in equine feces using the described ELISA kit and protocol. With additional study to establish reference interval and clinical utility, the fecal inflammatory biomarker CP may allow for noninvasive quantification of intestinal inflammation in horses. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: Colic is the commonest emergency in first opinion equine practice. Early referral is important for horses requiring surgery. Fast localised abdominal ultrasonography of horses (FLASH) is frequently used as a diagnostic tool in the investigation of colic at referral hospitals, but its use in first opinion practice has not been evaluated. Objective: To assess the value of FLASH scanning in the primary assessment of horses with colic in the field, using a portable wireless ultrasound system. Study design: Prospective study (2018–2021). Methods: Any horse examined for colic as an emergency in a first opinion ambulatory practice was eligible for inclusion in the study. A FLASH examination was performed using a wireless handheld ultrasound scanner, with the images displayed on a smartphone or tablet. The findings on FLASH scans and the outcome of the case (recovered, referred for surgery or euthanised without referral) were recorded. Results: In total, 135 equids with acute colic were evaluated. Of the 135 horses, 49 (36%) had an abnormal finding on FLASH scanning, including distended loops of small intestine (n = 34), thickened small intestinal walls (n = 23) and/or distension of the stomach (n = 7). Reduced small intestinal motility was recorded in 52 animals (38%). Follow-up information was available in all animals: 50 (37%) were euthanised due to clinical deterioration and the owners' decision not to undertake surgery; 85/135 (63%) survived, including 5/85 (6%) that underwent surgery and 80/85 (94%) that resolved with medical management. Main limitations: Small number of cases. Lack of results of post-mortem examination of horses that were euthanised. Potential selection bias. Conclusion: The FLASH technique can be valuable in the primary assessment of horses with colic in first opinion ambulatory practice. Further evaluation with more cases is required. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: RNA molecules within ejaculated sperm can be characterized through whole-transcriptome sequencing, enabling the identification of pivotal transcripts that may influence reproductive success. However, the profiling of sperm transcriptomes through next-generation sequencing has several limitations impairing the identification of functional transcripts. In this study, we explored the nature of the RNA sequences present in the sperm transcriptome of two livestock species, cattle and horses, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Through processing of transcriptomic data derived from bovine and equine sperm cell preparations, low mapping rates to the reference genomes were observed, mainly attributed to the presence of ribosomal RNA and bacteria in sperm samples, which led to a reduced sequencing depth of RNAs of interest. To explore the presence of bacteria, we aligned the unmapped reads to a complete database of bacterial genomes and identified bacteria-associated transcripts which were characterized. This analysis examines the limitations associated with sperm transcriptome profiling by reporting the nature of the RNA sequences among which bacterial RNA was found. These findings can aid researchers in understanding spermatozoal RNA-seq data and pave the way for the identification of molecular markers of sperm performance. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is one of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens in horses with a high impact on animal health worldwide. Entry of the virus into epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and rapid local viral replication is followed by infection of local lymphoid tissues leading to cell-associated viremia and disease progression. Pre-existing mucosal immunity has previously been shown to reduce viral shedding and prevent viremia, consequently limiting severe disease manifestations. Here, nasopharyngeal transcriptomic profiling was used to identify differentially expressed genes following EHV-1 challenge in horses with different EHV-1 immune statuses. Immune horses (n = 4) did neither develop clinical disease nor viremia and did not shed virus after experimental infection, while non-immune horses (n = 4) did all the above. RNA sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples pre- and 24 hours post-infection (24hpi). At 24hpi, 109 and 44 genes were upregulated in immune horses and non-immune horses, respectively, and three genes were explored in further detail. Antileukoproteinase (SLPI) gene expression increased 2.1-fold within 24 hours in immune horses in concert with protein secretion. Interferon (IFN)-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) and 3 (IFIT3) were upregulated in non-immune horses, corresponding with nasal IFN-α secretion and viral replication. By contrast, neither IFIT expression nor IFN-α secretion was induced by EHV-1 infection of immune horses. Transcriptomic profiling offered a tool to identify, for the first time, the role of SLPI in innate immunity against EHV-1, and further emphasized the central role of the type I IFN response in the anti-viral defense of non-immune horses. © 2024 American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) enters through the upper respiratory tract (URT). Mucosal immunity at the URT is crucial in limiting viral infection and morbidity. Here, intranasal immune cells were collected from horses (n = 15) during an experimental EHV-1 infection. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were the major intranasal cell populations before infection and increased significantly by day six and fourteen post-infection, respectively. Nasal mucosal T cells were further characterized in healthy horses. Compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), mucosal CD8+ T-cell percentages were elevated, while CD4+ T-cell percentages were similar. A small population of CD4+CD8+ T cells was also recovered from mucosal samples. Within the URT tissue, CD4+ cells predominantly accumulated in the epithelial layer, while most CD8+ cells resided deeper in the mucosa or the submucosa below the basement membrane. In vitro stimulation of mucosal cells from healthy horses with (n = 5) or without (n = 5) peripheral T-cell immunity against EHV-1 induced IFN-γ production in nasal T cells upon polyclonal stimulation. However, after EHV-1 re-stimulation, mucosal T cells failed to respond with IFN-γ. This work provided the first characterization of mucosal T-cell phenotypes and functions in the URT of healthy horses and during EHV-1 infection. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The inflammatory response to a truly closed castration procedure in 51 horses using an inguinal approach was quantified by serum amyloid A (SAA) measurements to be on average 94 mg/L on day three after surgery. The average SAA value after field castrations, using a scrotal approach, was reported by four different investigations to be between 480 and 708 mg/L on day three post-operatively. The discrepancy in SAA levels between these different approaches proved to be significant (p < 0.001), quantifying a substantially lower inflammatory response of the closed inguinal technique over regular field castrations using a scrotal approach. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Leptospirosis is an anthropozoonosis of economic and public health importance, caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Horses are deemed important in its transmission chain due to their proximity to humans, and because the species is often asymptomatic, making these animals potential silent reservoirs. In this context, the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of seropositive horses for Leptospira spp., and to identify the presence of Leptospira spp. serogroups and antibody titers, the occurrence of areas with higher density of infection cases and demographic characteristics associated with seropositivity in the states of Paraíba (PB), Pernambuco (PE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Ceará (CE), in the Northeast region of Brazil, during rainy (May and June) and dry (October and November) seasons from 2017 to 2019. Using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), 1152 equine serum samples from 225 municipalities were analyzed. Anti-Leptospira antibodies were detected in 23.9 % (95 % CI= 21.4 – 26.3 %) of the samples in the three-year period, with a frequency of 30.4 % (95 % CI= 26.7 – 34.2 %) during the rainy period (with greater emphasis on the Ballum serogroup) and 17.4 % (95 % CI= 14.3 – 20.5 %) in the dry period (with greater emphasis on the Sejroe serogroup). Age of horses ≥ 6 years (6–10 years, 11–15 years and ≥ 16 years), rainy season, and animal belonging to Pernambuco state were factors with higher seropositivities. Regarding spatial distribution, a higher percentage of seropositive animals was observed in Pernambuco (P < 0.05), in interstate border areas, and large urban centers, with a spatial cluster detected in the dry season of 2018 with relative risk of 2.8 (P = 0.049) times higher in municipalities within the cluster. It is suggested that measures for controlling rodents and contact with wild animals in equine farming, both in rainy and dry periods, combined with care regarding the use of pastures shared with cattle and the adoption of immunoprophylaxis are important in preventing and controlling leptospirosis in horses in the Northeast region of Brazil. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Horses infected by a tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) can develop clinically apparent infections. In humans, vaccination is the most effective preventive measure, while a vaccine is not available for horses. The objective of this study was to describe the immune response in horses after a TBEV vaccination with a human vaccine. (2) Materials and Methods: Seven healthy horses were randomised to a treatment or a control group in a stratified fashion based on TBEV–IgG concentrations on day −4. The treatment group (n = 4) was intramuscularly vaccinated using an inactivated human TBEV vaccine on days 0 and 28; the control group (n = 3) did not receive an injection. A clinical examination and blood sampling were performed on day –4, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 43, 56, 84, and 373. A linear mixed model analysis was used to compare IgG and IgM concentrations, neutralising antibody (nAb) titres, leucocyte count, serum amyloid A (SAA), and fibrinogen and globulin concentrations between the groups and time points. (3) Results: The clinical examination was normal in all horses at all time points. There were no significant changes in SAA, globulin, and fibrinogen concentrations and leucocyte count between the groups or time points (all p > 0.05). There was no significant increase in IgG, IgM, or nAb titres in the control group over time (all p > 0.05). In the vaccination group, there was a significant increase in IgG concentration and nAb titres after the second vaccination (p < 0.0001). There was no significant increase in IgM antibodies after the TBEV vaccination (all p > 0.05). One horse in the vaccination group had an IgM concentration above the laboratory reference on day 10. (4) Conclusions: The human TBEV vaccine did not have side effects when used in healthy horses in this study. A significant rise in TBEV-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs after the second vaccination was observed. However, IgG and nAb titres have been shown to decrease within 1 year after vaccination. The results of this study indicate that a vaccination with a human vaccine only induces a mild rise in IgM antibodies and only in previously naive horses. With no significant changes to inflammatory parameters in the vaccinated horses, it remains unclear whether vaccination with the human vaccine leads to protective immunity. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Mesodiverticular bands (MDBs) are an embryonic remnant of the vitelline artery. Information about the clinical significance of equine MDBs is currently limited. Objectives: To report the clinical features, surgical findings and outcomes of horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy where a MDB was identified. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Case records of horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for colic over a 14-year period (2009–2022) were reviewed. MDBs identified at laparotomy were classified as the primary or contributory cause of abdominal pain, or as incidental. Results: MDBs were identified in 40/1943 horses (2.1%) and 15 were primary (32.5%), 10 contributory (25%) and 15 incidental (32.5%). Horses with primary MDBs (median 2 years, IQR 1–12) were significantly younger than horses with incidental MDBs (median 8 years, IQR 6–16; P = 0.01). MDBs were more likely to be incidental if located in the mid-jejunum (5/5) (P < 0.001) or where a mesenteric pocket was absent (11/15) (P = 0.01). Primary MDBs caused extra-mural obstruction due to mesenteric shortening (n = 4), small intestinal entrapment within the MDB pocket (n = 5) or in an adjacent mesenteric rent (n = 4), and volvulus around the MDB (n = 2), with intestinal resection required in 8/15 cases. For horses with primary MDBs, survival to hospital discharge was 60% overall (9/15) and 75% for horses that stood following anaesthesia (9/12) with 88.9% of cases discharged from hospital (8/9) surviving >1 year. Excision of MDB tissue was not associated with complications but 3/4 non-incidental MDBs left in situ required relaparotomy to treat MDB-associated colic. Main limitations: Retrospective single centre data. Conclusions: Most MDBs in horses undergoing surgical treatment of colic in this population were not incidental. MDB-associated colic was most commonly classified as strangulating obstruction, but non-strangulating extra-mural compression was also identified. Excision of MDB tissue should be undertaken where possible, particularly in non-incidental cases. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study conducted a thorough analysis of the myofiber type composition in the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) and soleus muscle (SOL) of Kazakh horses, across different genders (male and female). The results showed significant differences in myofiber type composition between EDL and SOL, with a higher proportion of Type I fibers in SOL muscles and a greater prevalence of Type II fibers in EDL muscles. Additionally, the myofiber diameter in Kazakh horses was relatively small, potentially related to the tenderness and edible quality of their muscles. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we constructed 32 cDNA sequencing libraries and obtained high-quality read data. Gene expression analysis revealed 278 and 372 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EDL and SOL muscles, respectively, including genes related to muscle contraction, metabolism, and development. Intersection analysis of DEGs between genders showed that 60 DEGs were significantly different in both male and female horses. GO annotation and KEGG analysis further elucidated the roles of these DEGs in muscle structure, function, and cellular signaling. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and identification of hub genes provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle growth and development. Finally, the reliability of the DEGs data was validated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This study not only enhances our understanding of the biological characteristics of horse muscles but also provides potential molecular targets for improving horse muscle performance and health. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Background: Parvalbumin Gad c1 is a major cod allergen used as a follow-up marker of fish-allergic children. However, the diagnostic efficacy of recombinant Gad c 1 (rGad c 1) for fish allergy diagnosis remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rGad c1 for diagnosing cod and horse mackerel allergy. Methods: This single-centered, retrospective study obtained oral food challenges (OFCs) information performed for cod and horse mackerel. Cod-, horse mackerel-, and rGad c1-specific immunoglobulins (sIgEs) were investigated. Diagnostic performances of these parameters were compared using areas under the curve (AUC). Results: We enrolled 45 and 38 children with suspected cod and horse mackerel allergies, respectively. The median age (interquartile range) of children with suspected cod allergy was 5.7 (0.7–11.7) years and that of children with suspected horse mackerel allergy was 6.0 (1.0–12.3) years. Fourteen and 22 children reacted to OFCs with 25 (10–40) g of cooked pacific cod and 40 (10–40) g of cooked horse mackerel, respectively. The cod sIgE and rGad c 1 sIgE AUCs for cod allergy diagnosis were 0.85 and 0.90, respectively. For horse mackerel allergy diagnosis, AUCs of horse mackerel and rGad c 1 sIgE were 0.76 and 0.72, respectively. Both AUCs for cod and mackerel allergy were significantly different. Conclusion: rGad c 1 sIgE is more effective than cod sIgE as a diagnostic marker of cod allergy, but less effective than horse mackerel sIgE as a diagnostic marker of horse mackerel allergy. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential applications of rGad c 1 sIgE in the diagnosis of various fish allergies. © 2024 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Oldenburg horse breed, due to its versatility, is a promising object for scientific research. Identification of regular relationships between genealogical characteristics, morphometric indicators and athletic achievements of representatives of this breed is critical for the development of effective breeding programmes. The purpose of the study was to analyse the influence of line affiliation on the morphological characteristics and athletic performance of Oldenburg horses and to identify links between morphological traits and athletic performance. The study was conducted at the equestrian complex “Schockemoehle” (Germany), including 90 Oldenburg horses, divided by sex and lineage. Morphometric indicators and sports achievements are analysed. The results show the dominance of the Cor de la Bryere lineage (48.9% of the total sample), which indicates the success of breeding programmes in improving its characteristics. Other significant lines had a share of 15.6% to 10.0% in the sample structure. Morphometric analysis showed high uniformity among horses in height at the withers and metacarpal circumference, with slight differences between the sex groups: height at the withers ranges from 168.13 cm to 169.2 cm, and metacarpal circumference – from 20.85 cm to 20.99 cm. Analysis of sporting achievements showed that geldings are highly effective in overcoming high obstacles, reaching the Grand Prix level (≥155 cm) in 23% of cases, compared to 10% among stallions and mares. Stallions and mares usually reach the level of 130-140 cm, with some predominance of mares in this category. The study of different lines shows that the Diamant de Semilly and Almé Z lines have advantages in morphometric parameters, such as height at the withers and metacarpal circumference, which can affect athletic performance. The Capitol I line has the largest number of competitions, but needs to be improved to achieve better athletic performance. The practical significance of the results lies in the possibility of optimising the breeding strategies of sports horses to achieve better achievements in competitions. © The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne virus that can infect pigs, horses, and other mammals, including humans. Sero-epidemiological investigations of JEV have been performed using hemagglutination inhibition (HI), virus neutralization (VN) tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A need exists for a new ELISA that can detect JEV antibodies in the sera of several animal species. We aimed to develop a blocking ELISA (B-ELISA) for detecting JEV antibodies in pig and horse serum samples. JEV antibodies in 218 pig and 315 horse serum samples were measured using HI and VN tests. The purified KV1899-306 strain was used as an antigen for B-ELISA. The purified antibody (7A13) was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used as a detector antibody. The sera of pigs and horses to measure antibody against JEV were subjected to B-ELISA and analyzed. The B-ELISA had a diagnostic sensitivity of 94.6% to 100%, a specificity of 91.2 to 100%, and an accuracy of 94.9 to 98.6% compared with those of the HI and VN tests in pig and horse sera. The B-ELISA had a higher correlation with pig sera (r = 0.89 and 0.90 for VN and HI) than with horse sera (r = 0.75 and to 0.79). The new B-ELISA could be useful in the sero-surveillance of JEV in pig and horse sera and replace indirect ELISA. © 2024 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: The welfare of sports horses is debated both within and outside the horse community. One welfare concern is the frequent occurrence of oral lesions. Lesions may be caused by inappropriate training and ill-fitting equipment. Increased knowledge of behavioural signs of pain, discomfort and frustration (often jointly labelled ‘conflict behaviour’) in horses can increase awareness by riders, trainers, officials, and competition judges, which is a first step towards reducing the occurrence. This study included 11 warmblood dressage horses competing at upper national level (Intermediaire I). The horses were randomly selected (from a total of 22 horses) for an unannounced inspection for oral lesions immediately after leaving the dressage arena. Five of the 11 horses had abrasion of the skin and/or mucosa at one or both commissures of the lips and were eliminated from the competition according to the rules of the national equestrian federation. An experienced observer who was blind regarding the outcome of the inspection, scored behaviour in the 11 horses from official video recordings available online from the event. The frequency of mouth opening ranged from 5 to 59 times in the 11 horses. Horses with oral lesions had a significantly higher frequency of mouth opening compared to horses without oral lesions (t-test, mean ±SEM; lesions: 34.6 ±6.7 vs. no lesions: 12.2 ±2.4, t(9) = 3.4, P = 0.008). The frequency of other conflict behaviours did not differ significantly between the groups (e.g. tail swishing: MWU-test, median [25;75 %]; lesions: 25 [14;27] vs. no lesions: 10 [6,24], U = 7.0, P = 0.18). It is concluded that oral behaviour may be a useful indicator of oral lesions. Further studies are needed to investigate behavioural signs of discomfort and pain in riding horses, as behaviour can be an early predictor of compromised welfare. Increased awareness of subtle behavioural signs is therefore an important first step towards improved sports horse welfare. © 2024

ABSTRACT: DISTAL limb wounds in horses account for more than 60% of all wounds. This study described the clinical effect of mesenchymal stem cell-derived microvesicles (MVs) on healing of equine distal limb chronic wounds. Twelve Arabian horses with distal limb granulating wounds (Group I, n=6) or ulcerated wounds (Group II, n=6) were treated surgically either by excision of the granulating masses or debridement of ulcers. In group I, the horses were divided randomly into two subgroups (3 horses each); subgroup 1 was given two doses of topical and subcutaneous injection of MVs after surgery. Subgroup 2 (control) was treated only by surgery. Group II was divided randomly into two equal subgroups; subgroup 1 was given one dose of topical and subcutaneous injection of MVs after surgery and subgroup 2 was treated by debridement (control). Healing progression was documented using digimizer image analysis software and data were statistically analyzed. The mean areas of the granulating and ulcerating wounds were 81.71±3.25 cm2 and 18.91±1.78 cm2, respectively. In group I, complete wound healing was achieved on days 70±3.5 and 100±4.32 in subgroups 1 and 2, respectively. However, complete wound healing was achieved in group II on days 27±2.3 and 41±3.1 in subgroups 1 and 2, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in wound area reduction between the two subgroups in both groups (P< .05). In conclusion, this preliminary study indicated that topical and subcutaneous injection of MVs after surgical interferences may enhance healing of the chronic wounds in distal limbs of horses. ©2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

ABSTRACT: The evolutionary history of equids represents a paradigmatic case of evolution through time and space when, during the Cenozoic, fossil equids experimented with a variety of forms as well as multiple dietary adaptations. Nowadays, only a single genus of Equidae (Subfamily Equinae, tribe Equini) has survived, Equus, represented by wild zebras and asses and domesticated horses. In this contribution, we undertake a comprehensive mesowear analysis on the Equus simplicidens population from the Hagerman Horse Quarry, Idaho, Pliocene. Our sample includes sixty-two individuals based on crania and maxillae. We used the classic mesowear method in scoring the first or second molar paracone and calculated the average percentages of high versus low relief and sharp versus round versus blunt cusps, but also scored mesowear along a continuum that ranged from sharp cusps with high relief to blunt cusps with low relief by comparing E. simplicidens and extant ungulates. We applied the same methodology to a sample of living zebras, asses and horses to increase our comparative sample. Our results show that the Hagerman E. simplicidens sample had a high-abrasive diet as recorded in the living equid sample, and exhibited no significant distinction between the different age classes sampled. For the first time, these results show that the paleodietary behavior of E. simplicidens was similar to those of the living Equus species. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Concentrations of starch, mono- and disaccharides, fructans, hemicellulose and cellulose were analysed in feed and gastric digesta of horses in relation to acid insoluble ash as a marker indigestible in the stomach. Twenty-four horses were allocated to pasture 24 h/d (PST; n = 4), hay ad libitum (HAY; n = 8), hay ad lib. and oats at 1 g starch/kg body weight (BWT)/meal (OS1; n = 6) and hay ad lib. and oats at 2 g starch/kg BWT/meal (OS2; n = 5). One horse was excluded from the analysis. The horses were fed the ration a minimum of 34 days. Following euthanasia and dissection, digesta was sampled from Pars nonglandularis (PNG) and Pars glandularis (PG). Oat starch concentration in gastric digesta decreased from 309 to 174 g/kg dry matter (DM) in OS1 (44 %-reduction) and from 367 to 261 g/kg DM in OS2 (29 %-reduction) (P < 0.001). Glucose, fructose and sucrose disappeared from gastric digesta distinctly more in PST, HAY and OS1 than in OS2. In PST and HAY, sucrose concentration was completely cleared (P < 0.001). The concentration of fructans was reduced predominantly in PST (84 %-reduction) and HAY (54 %-reduction), mainly in the PNG (P < 0.05). Fructan degradation did not occur in the high-starch diet (OS2). Some evidence for fibre degradation was observed in PST (P < 0.01). Soluble carbohydrates disappear from the stomach dependent on the type of ration, which may lead to changes in the composition of the gastric microbial community and the endogenous response. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: Diagnosis of colitis has been shown to impact morbidity and mortality in hospitalised horses. There are no studies to date that describe the incidence of infectious colitis after exploratory laparotomy. Objectives: To investigate risk factors associated with the development of colitis and infectious colitis post-exploratory laparotomy. Study design: Retrospective case–control. Methods: Medical records of equids admitted from 2011 to 2020 were reviewed. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of colitis following exploratory laparotomy. Bivariable associations between colitis and risk factors were assessed using the 2-sample t-test and Fisher's exact test. All risk factors were subjected to a backward elimination variable reduction algorithm within a logistic regression framework (p-value set to 0.05). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed for the final model. Results: A total of 504 equids were included in the study. Forty-two patients (8.3%) were diagnosed with postoperative colitis. Five patients were diagnosed with Salmonella spp. and two with Clostridioides difficile. The odds of postoperative colitis were higher among patients that had pelvic flexure enterotomy (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.7–7.9, p = 0.001), postoperative leukopenia or leukocytosis (OR = 21.2, 95% CI = 9.7–46.7, p < 0.001), or plasma lactate 2.0–4.0 mmol/L (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.3–6.7, p < 0.008). Patients diagnosed with colitis had a longer median length of hospitalisation (9 days; range 2–21) compared with patients without colitis (7 days; range 2–25). Patients with colitis had a survival to discharge rate similar to patients without colitis (95% compared to 93%). Main limitations: Risk factors for infectious colitis could not be determined due to variation in testing protocols in this retrospective study and the low number of positive cases. Conclusions: Colitis as a postoperative complication does not negatively impact survival to discharge but is associated with longer hospitalisation. Pelvic flexure enterotomy, postoperative leukopenia or leukocytosis, and increased plasma lactate were identified as significant risk factors associated with colitis. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This case report discusses the clinical signs, diagnostic findings, treatment and outcome of a 6-year-old Italian Warmblood gelding referred for evaluation of a chronic unilateral ocular mucopurulent discharge that had been ongoing for several months. Dacryocystorhinography and computed tomography dacryocystography (CT-DCG) allowed the identification of a neoformation associated with tooth 206 connected to a cystic lesion occupying the ipsilateral ventral nasal concha. It is likely that both lesions caused stenosis of the nasolacrimal duct and secondary recurrent ocular discharge. Once the 206 tooth had been surgically removed, a histological diagnosis of nodular hypercementosis associated with a small cystic lesion was made. In this case, CT-DCG was extremely important in identifying the source of the ocular discharge and guiding the surgical planning for tooth removal. A follow-up telephone conversation with the owner 6 months postoperatively reported that the horse had not shown further ocular discharge. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Post-operative reflux (POR) is rare following large colon volvulus (LCV) but does occur despite the absence of a small intestinal lesion. The prevalence, risk factors and association with survival of POR after LCV are currently unknown. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of POR in horses with an LCV and its association with survival. A further objective was to assess factors which may predict POR. The hypothesis was that horses with POR following LCV surgery have a worse outcome for survival compared to those without POR. Study design: A retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Clinical data of client owned horses which underwent colic surgery at a single UK referral hospital between 2008 and 2021, where LCV was the primary finding, were retrieved from hospital records. Statistical analyses included chi-squared, t-tests and odds ratios (ORs). Horses with concurrent lesions, and those that did not survive past anaesthetic recovery, were excluded from analysis. POR was defined as ≥2 L of gastric reflux on at least one occasion. Results: A total of 128 horses were included in the study, 23 of which had POR (18%). Overall survival to hospital discharge was 86%, 95% in the non-POR and 44% in the POR group. Horses with POR were less likely to survive to discharge than those without (OR = 26, 95% confidence interval [CI] [7.68–88.0], p < 0.001), and less likely to be alive 3 years after surgery (OR = 13.4, 95% CI [2.78–64.8], p < 0.001). Main limitations: Due to the retrospective study design, full data sets were not available for every case because clinical records were incomplete or, at that time, certain tests were not performed or clinical variables were not measured. Conclusions: POR in LCV cases is a negative prognostic indicator for survival. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritis (OA) in horses often affects the metacarpal/metatarsophalangeal (MCP/MTP) joints and its detection in the early stages is crucial for effective management. I t was hypothesized that the extent of cartilage damage positively correlates with synovial membrane (SM) and synovial fluid (SF) pathological findings in the MCP/MTP joints of Serbian mountain horses that transported heavy loads but did not show signs of lameness. The study was conducted on 32 MCP/MTP joints of eight horses between seven to 12 years of age. Horse limbs were transferred from the abattoir to the necropsy room and SF was sampled. Its appearance, total nucleated cell count (TNCC), mononuclear cell count (MNC), total proteins (TP), and haptoglobin (Hp) were determined. Samples of SM were collected from the dorsal palmar/plantar pouch for histology. A macroscopic examination of gross condylar pathology of the third metacarpal/metatarsal bone was performed with Indian Ink staining. Scoring was done based on Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommendations. SF was clear, pale yellow, and mostly fairly viscous. Half of the samples had TNCC above, and all had TP within the reference range. Hp values were below the reference range and were omitted from further analyses. TNCC correlated with MNC (ρs=0.81, P<0.001), microscopic (ρs=0.62, P=0.003) and macroscopic scores (ρs=0.47, P=0.008). In addition, MNC correlated with macroscopic scores (ρs=0.40, P=0.03). All pathological findings were mild and their correlation indicated that these processes are interrelated and that could be ascribed to early OA.  © 2024 Lazar Marković et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: The aims of the present meta-analysis were (i) to re-evaluate the factorially calculated Ca, P and Mg requirements to replace endogenous faecal losses, taking new data into account, (ii) to identify potential differences between horses and ponies regarding requirements, apparent digestibility, serum levels and renal excretion of Ca, P and Mg and (iii) to investigate the influence of mineral sources, i.e., “inorganic” sources from added mineral salts and “organic” sources from feed plants. For P, the water solubility of “inorganic” sources was taken into consideration. Data on the aforementioned parameters from 42 studies were plotted against intake, similar to the Lucas test for true digestibility and faecal endogenous losses. Within specific intake ranges, data were compared using t-tests and an ANOVA, followed by Holm–Sidak post hoc tests. Ponies had lower endogenous faecal Mg losses than horses. Consequently, apparent Mg digestibility was higher in ponies. Factorial calculations of Mg requirements to replace faecal losses showed that ponies needed approximately half of the current recommended amount, while horses required 1.9 times the amount currently recommended by Kienzle and Burger. The overall mean matched previous recommendations. For Ca, there was no discernible difference between ponies and horses. True Ca digestibility calculated by the Lucas test was higher and endogenous losses were lower when “organic” Ca was fed as opposed to when “inorganic” sources were used. The resulting factorial calculations of the requirements to replace faecal losses were close to current recommendations for “organic” Ca. For “inorganic” sources, however, the new calculations were below the recommended level. For P, there were no discernible differences between horses and ponies. There were also no clear effects of “inorganic” or “organic” P sources. The water solubility of “inorganic” sources was the key factor determining P metabolism. Water-soluble P sources exhibited higher true and apparent digestibility. The intake of these P sources led to hyperphosphatemia and hyperphosphaturia, even at low intakes. In other species, this has been shown to pose a health risk. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid the use of highly water-soluble “inorganic” P sources in horses and ponies. Given the lower digestibility of insoluble P sources, the factorially calculated P requirements for such sources are higher than the current recommendations. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus (genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae) that has re-emerged in South America in late 2023, causing severe disease in both horses and humans after a nearly 40-year intermission period. We here describe the virological, serological, pathological, and molecular features of WEEV infection in horses during the 2023–2024 outbreak in Argentina. WEEV-infected horses developed neurological signs with mild to severe encephalitis associated with minimal to abundant WEEV-infected cells, as demonstrated by WEEV-specific in situ hybridization. The distribution of viral RNA was multifocal, with predominance within neuronal bodies, neuronal processes, and glial cells in the medulla oblongata and thalamic regions. Phylogenetic analysis of partial nsP4 sequences from three viral isolates obtained from three different provinces of Argentina support grouping with other temporally current WEEV strains from Uruguay and Brazil under a recently proposed novel lineage. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine piroplasmosis is caused by Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, which are hemoprotozoan parasites. Understanding the epidemiology and genotypes of T. equi and B. caballi is crucial for developing effective control strategies in endemic countries. However, the endemic status of these two parasite species remains uncertain in Kyrgyzstan due to lack of surveys. Our study, therefore, aimed to detect T. equi and B. caballi infections in Kyrgyzstan and identify their genotypes. Blood samples were collected from 226 horses across all seven provinces of Kyrgyzstan, namely Chuy, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Talas, Jalal-Abad, Osh, and Batken. These blood samples were subjected to DNA extraction, followed by specific PCR assays targeting T. equi and B. caballi. We found that 56 (24.8%, confidence interval (CI): 19.6–30.8%) and 7 (3.1%, CI: 1.5–6.3%) of the tested horses were positive for T. equi and B. caballi infections, respectively. Theileria equi was detected in all surveyed provinces, whereas B. caballi was found in five provinces, except for Talas and Osh. Subsequent genotype-specific PCR assays showed that T. equi-positive horses harbored all five genotypes: A, B, C (also known as Theileria haneyi), D, and E. On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis of B. caballi rap-1 sequences detected the genotypes A and B1. The prevalence of T. equi and B. caballi suggests a potential risk of clinical equine piroplasmosis among horses in Kyrgyzstan, and the observed genotypic diversity underscores the challenges in managing the disease. Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive control measures to effectively address equine piroplasmosis in Kyrgyzstan. © 2023

ABSTRACT: In the past, small population sizes and unequal ancestor contributions have resulted in high inbreeding rates (ΔF) in the Friesian horse. Two decades ago, the studbook implemented a mating quota and started publishing individual kinships and reduced ΔF below 1% per generation. However, since then, the breeding population size has decreased and this raises the question whether current breeding strategies are sufficient to keep ΔF below desired rates. The aim of this study was to (1) reflect on past inbreeding trends and their main determinants, using pedigree analysis and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the current and additional breeding strategies using stochastic simulations. We estimated the current ΔF (2013–2022) at 0.72% per generation. While the total contribution of the top 10 sires to the number of offspring per year has decreased from 75% in 1980 to 35% in 2022, this was mainly due to an increased number of approved studbook sires, and not due to more equalized contributions among sires. Of the simulated breeding strategies, selecting only breeding stallions with a below average mean kinship (i.e., “mean kinship selection”) was most effective to decrease ΔF (from 0.66% to 0.33%). Increasing the number of breeding sires only had an effect when also a mating quota was applied. However, its effect remained limited. For example, a ~1.5 fold increase, combined with a mating quota of 80 offspring per sire per year, reduced ΔF from 0.55% to 0.51%. When increasing the number of breeding mares, a practically unfeasible large increase was needed for a meaningful reduction in ΔF (e.g. twice as many mares were needed to reduce ΔF from 0.66% to 0.56%). Stratified mating quotas, a novel approach in which we assigned each sire a mating quota (of 60, 80, 100 or 120 offspring per year) based on its mean kinship to recently born foals, resulted in a lower ΔF (0.43%) than a general mating quota of 90 offspring per sire per year (0.55%). Overall, while the current ΔF is below 1%, we recommend to implement additional strategies to further reduce ΔF below 0.5% in the Friesian horse population. For this breed and similar populations, we recommend to focus on breeding strategies based on kinship levels to effectively reduce ΔF. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Musculoskeletal simulations can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern animal locomotion. In this study, we describe the development of a new musculoskeletal model of the horse, and to our knowledge present the first fully muscle-driven, predictive simulations of equine locomotion. Our goal was to simulate a model that captures only the gross musculoskeletalstructure of a horse, withoutspecialized morphological features. We mostly presentsimulations acquired using feedforward control,withoutstate feedback ("top-down control"). Without using kinematics or motion capture data as an input, we have simulated a variety of gaitsthat are commonly used by horses(walk, pace, trot, t lt, and collected gallop). We also found a selection of gaits that are not normally seen in horses (half bound, extended gallop, ambling). Due to the clinical relevance of the trot, we performed a tracking simulation that included empirical joint angle deviations in the cost function. To further demonstrate the flexibility of our model, we also present a simulation acquired using spinal feedback control, where muscle control signals are wholly determined by gait kinematics. Despite simplifications to the musculature, simulated footfalls and ground reaction forces followed empirical patterns. In the tracking simulation, kinematics improved with respect to the fully predictive simulations, and muscle activations showed a reasonable correspondence to electromyographic signals, although we did not predict any anticipatory firing of muscles. When sequentially increasing the targetspeed, oursimulationsspontaneously predicted walk-to-run transitions at the empirically determined speed. However, predicted stride lengths were too short over nearly the entire speed range unless explicitly prescribed in the controller, and we also did not recover spontaneous transitions to asymmetric gaits such as galloping. Taken together, our model performed adequately when simulating individual gaits, but our simulation workflow was not able to capture all aspects of gait selection. We point out certain aspects of our workflow that may have caused this, including anatomical simplifications and the use of massless Hill-type actuators. Our model is an extensible, generalized horse model, with considerable scope for adding anatomical complexity. This project is intended as a starting point for continual development of the model and code that we make available in extensible open-source formats.  © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Facial expressions are important in pain recognition in horses, but current observation-based pain scales remain subjective. A promising technique to quantitatively measure subtle changes in expression patterns, including changes invisible to the human eye, is surface electromyography (sEMG). To achieve high-quality and reliable sEMG signals, unilateral placement of bipolar electrodes is required in relation to the motor endplates (MEP). We aimed to localize the nerve entry points (NEPs; where the nerve branch first pierced the muscle belly) and the direction of the terminal nerve endings to estimate MEP locations of the innervating nerves in five equine facial muscles involved in pain expression. Three cadaveric Dutch Warmblood horse heads were dissected to identify the NEPs in the musculi caninus, levator anguli oculi medialis, nasolabialis, masseter and zygomaticus. These points were marked with pins and measured in relation to a reference line between two anatomical landmarks near the origin and insertion of the respective muscle. Relative distances were calculated from the most caudally situated landmark. NEPs were located at 33%–38% (caninus), 69%–86% (levator anguli oculi medialis) and 0%–18% (zygomaticus) from the caudal landmark. The nasolabialis showed two innervations zones. Its NEPs were located at 47%–72% (dorsal muscle branch) and 52%–91% (ventral branch). All terminal nerve endings were found to run in rostral direction. The masseter showed numerous NEPs diffusely spread within the muscle belly. Therefore, calculation of relative positions was not performed. These results could form the basis for feasibility studies and standardization of bipolar electrode positioning in vivo to measure facial muscle activity patterns in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Vitiligo is a depigmentation autoimmune disorder characterized by the progressive loss of melanocytes leading to the appearance of patchy depigmentation of the skin. The presence of vitiligo in horses is greater in those with grey coats. The aim of this study was therefore to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions and putative candidate loci associated with vitiligo depigmentation and susceptibility in the Pura Raza Español population. For this purpose, we performed a wssGBLUP (weighted single step genomic best linear unbiased prediction) using data from a total of 2359 animals genotyped with Affymetrix Axiom™ Equine 670 K and 1346 with Equine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler™ (GGP) Array V5. A total of 60,136 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) present on the 32 chromosomes from the consensus dataset after quality control were employed for the analysis. Vitiligo-like depigmentation was phenotyped by visual inspection of the different affected areas (eyes, mouth, nostrils) and was classified into nine categories with three degrees of severity (absent, slight, and severe). We identified one significant genomic region for vitiligo around the eyes, eight significant genomic regions for vitiligo around the mouth, and seven significant genomic regions for vitiligo around the nostrils, which explained the highest percentage of variance. These significant genomic regions contained candidate genes related to melanocytes, skin, immune system, tumour suppression, metastasis, and cutaneous carcinoma. These findings enable us to implement selective breeding strategies to decrease the incidence of vitiligo and to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying vitiligo in horses as well as the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease’s development. However, further studies are needed to better understand this skin disorder in horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Post-traumatic distal limb wounds cause discomfort and heal gradually by second intention. The topical application of Tri-Solfen (lidocaine hydrochloride, bupivacaine hydrochloride, adrenaline acid tartrate and cetrimide [LBAC]) produces effective postsurgical cutaneous analgesia in lambs, calves and piglets; however, its effect on wounds in horses is unknown. Methods: The antinociceptive effect, measured by mechanical threshold (MT), and the wound healing impacts of LBAC compared with saline were investigated on surgically created 20 × 20 mm distal limb wounds in 10 horses. Treatment was applied once daily for 7 days following wounding on day 0. Mechanical thresholds were measured after treatment on days 1, 2 and 3. Healing was observed for 25 days. Results: The topical application of LBAC immediately following wounding and its reapplication 24 hours later increased the average MT on the first post-traumatic day by 3 Newtons. However, no antinociceptive benefit was observed on days 2 or 3. Treatment with LBAC did not adversely affect wound healing when compared with saline. Limitations: Methodological differences preclude absolute MT comparisons between studies. The experimental design did not include a model of contaminated or naturally occurring wounds. Conclusion: LBAC may provide an early antinociceptive benefit when applied to uncontaminated surgically created wounds without compromising healing. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Consistent information and standardization procedures regarding the time of storage for frozen samples and the effects of storage time on enzyme activity are still missing in the literature. Thus, we evaluated the effects of different storage temperatures (−20 °C and − 80 °C), three repetitive freeze/thaw cycles, and 24-h mimic transportation on the activities of PON1 (paraoxonase and arylesterase), enzymes involved in the protection and detoxification processes of reactive molecules. PON1 enzymes' activity was validated on serum and heparinized plasma in horses. The results revealed that conditions and time of storage of blood samples for PON1 analyses altered the activities of both enzymes in both sample types, evidencing that these conditions can lead to protein degradation or general alteration. Specifically, paraoxonase and arylesterase activities significantly decreased among storage temperatures, with major effects detected at −20 °C. The repeated freeze/thaw cycles at −20 °C and 24-h mimic transport conditions also generated an expected degradation of the arylesterase in both serum and heparinized plasma while freeze/thaw cycles at −80 °C caused an increase of both arylesterase and paraoxonase activities on both sample types. In general, similar enzyme responses were detected between serum and heparinized plasma. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS) occurs with variable prevalence in horses, donkeys, and mules. Due to the particularities of the mucous membranes, the syndrome is made up of Squamous Gastric Disease (ESGD) and Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD). Given the multifactorial nature and multiple classification systems of the syndrome, significant differences have been reported between prevalence studies performed ante mortem, which are even more remarkable when compared with postmortem evaluations. This study aimed to determine the presence and grade of squamous gastric disease in horses, donkeys and mules immediately after slaughter. The postmortem examination considered the inspection of the squamous region (cardia, dorsal fundus, and margo plicatus) and the classification of the observed lesions. The general prevalence of ESGD in the entire population of study was 83.3 % (78 %, 89 %, and 83 % for horses, donkeys, and mules, respectively), compromising the margo plicatus in all cases. 75 % had more than 5 lesions and 50 % had deep lesions, lesions of varying severity and/or evidence of recent/active bleeding. The prevalence of ESGD was similar in horses, donkeys, and mules subjected to similar handling conditions prior to slaughter, including long-distance traveling, fasting, and stress factors. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: "Hoof Beats helps readers see the drama even in the grass eating. . . . Taylor has written that too-rare work that is as authoritative as it is legible to the lay audience."-New York Times Journey to the ancient past with cutting-edge science and new data to discover how horses forever altered the course of human history. From the Rockies to the Himalayas, the bond between horses and humans has spanned across time and civilizations. In this archaeological journey, William T. Taylor explores how momentous events in the story of humans and horses helped create the world we live in today. Tracing the horse's origins and spread from the western Eurasian steppes to the invention of horse-drawn transportation and the explosive shift to mounted riding, Taylor offers a revolutionary new account of how horses altered the course of human history. Drawing on Indigenous perspectives, ancient DNA, and new research from Mongolia to the Great Plains and beyond, Taylor guides readers through the major discoveries that have placed the horse at the origins of globalization, trade, biological exchange, and social inequality. Hoof Beats transforms our understanding of both horses and humanity's ancient past and asks us to consider what our relationship with horses means for the future of humanity and the world around us. © 2024 by William T.

ABSTRACT: A 1-year-old Miniature Horse filly was presented for chronic lethargy and hyporexia. Elevated liver enzymes, bile acids, and ammonia were noted on bloodwork. The primary differential diagnosis was a portosystemic shunt (PSS). Three-phase computed tomographic angiography findings were consistent with a transhepatic portosystemic shunt. Percutaneous liver biopsy confirmed severe diffuse hepatic changes, most likely due to chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicosis, and medical management was elected. Based on an extensive literature review, this is the first report of a transhepatic portosystemic collateral vessel in a horse. Computed tomographic angiography is feasible and useful for the diagnosis of PSS in miniature horses. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

ABSTRACT: The equine industry holds substantial economic importance not only in the USA but worldwide. The occurrence of various infectious bacterial diseases in horses can lead to severe health issues, economic losses, and restrictions on horse movement and trade. Effective management and control of these diseases are therefore crucial for the growth and sustainability of the equine industry. While antibiotics constitute the primary treatment strategy for any bacterial infections in horses, developing resistance to clinically important antibiotics poses significant challenges to equine health and welfare. The adverse effects of antimicrobial overuse and the escalating threat of resistance underscore the critical importance of antimicrobial stewardship within the equine industry. There is limited information on the epidemiology of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections in horses. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the history and types of antimicrobials used in horses and provide recommendations for combating drug-resistant bacterial infections in horses. This review also highlights the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in horses, emphasizing the public health significance and transmission dynamics between horses and other animals within a One Health framework. By fostering responsible practices and innovative control measures, we can better help the equine industry combat the pressing threat of AMR and thus safeguard equine as well as public health. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Reports of leptospirosis in horses are limited. Objectives: To describe the clinical and diagnostic findings of acute systemic leptospirosis in horses. Animals: Eleven client-owned horses presented to an equine hospital because of acute onset of disease between 2015 and 2023. Methods: Retrospective case series. Horses diagnosed with leptospirosis by 1 or more of urine PCR, serologic microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and histopathology. Results: Common clinical signs included lethargy (10), anorexia (10), fever (9), tachypnea (9), abnormal lung sounds (9), and epistaxis (6). Acute kidney injury was present in all cases. Evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage and liver disease was found in 8 (73%) and 6 (55%) horses, respectively. In 6 (55%) horses, kidneys, lungs, and liver were affected. Urine quantitative polymerase chain reaction for detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. was positive in 6 (55%) cases. On serology Leptospira interrogans serovar Australis, Autumnalis, and Bratislava accounted for 86% of all titers ≥1 : 800. Overall case fatality rate was 4/11 (36%). Main findings on necropsy were tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, hemorrhage in the alveoli, pulmonary edema, periportal hepatitis and necrosis, cholestasis, and cholangitis. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Leptospirosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in horses with evidence of acute systemic inflammation and acute renal injury, epistaxis, or hepatic disease. For increased likelihood of identifying positive cases, both MAT serology and urine PCR should be performed. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: While few places on earth have been as deeply impacted by the human-horse relationship as the steppes of Mongolia and eastern Eurasia, gaps in the archaeological record have made it strikingly difficult to trace when and how the first domestic horses were integrated into ancient societies in this key region of the world. Recently, organic materials preserved in melting mountain ice have emerged as a key source of archaeological insight into the region’s deep past. Newly-identified artefacts recovered from melting snow and ice in the Altai Mountain range of western Mongolia (including metal artefacts, skeletal remains, and hoof fragments) provide archaeological evidence for the use of horses at high altitudes from the Bronze Age through the 20th century. Direct radiocarbon dating and genomic sequencing demonstrate the presence of Przewalski’s horse in the region during the early second millennium BCE, suggesting that this taxon may have once foraged at high altitudes frequented by human hunters. Importantly, directly-dated remains of horse hoof trimmings provide some of the oldest direct evidence of horse transport in the Eastern Steppe as early as the 14th century BCE, and suggest a role for high-mountain hunting in the innovation of reliable mounted riding. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii) is an endangered equid native to the steppes of central Asia. After becoming extinct in the wild multiple conservation efforts convened to preserve the species, including captive breeding programs, reintroduction and monitoring systems, protected lands, and cloning. Availability of a highly contiguous reference genome is essential to support these continued efforts. We used Oxford Nanopore sequencing to produce a scaffold-level 2.5 Gb nuclear assembly and 16,002 bp mitogenome from a captive Przewalski’s mare. All assembly drafts were generated from 111 Gb of sequence from a single PromethION R10.4.1 flow cell. The mitogenome contained 37 genes in the standard mammalian configuration and was 99.63% identical to the domestic horse (Equus caballus). The nuclear assembly, EquPr2, contained 2,146 scaffolds with an N50 of 85.1 Mb, 43X mean depth, and BUSCO quality score of 98.92%. EquPr2 successfully improves upon the existing Przewalski’s horse reference genome (Burgud), with 25-fold fewer scaffolds, a 166-fold larger N50, and phased pseudohaplotypes. Modified basecalls revealed 79.5% DNA methylation and 2.1% hydroxymethylation globally. Allele-specific methylation analysis between pseudohaplotypes revealed 226 differentially methylated regions in known imprinted genes and loci not previously reported as imprinted. The heterozygosity rate of 0.165% matches previous estimates for the species and compares favorably to other endangered animals. This improved Przewalski’s horse assembly will serve as a valuable resource for conservation efforts and comparative genomics investigations. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: High levels of oxidant stress in the form of reactive oxidant species are prevalent in the circulation and tissues in various types of cardiovascular disease including heart failure, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. Here we review the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an important and widespread antioxidant and anti-inflammatory transcription factor that may contribute to the pathogenesis and maintenance of cardiovascular diseases. We review studies showing that downregulation of Nrf2 exacerbates heart failure, hypertension, and autonomic function. Finally, we discuss the potential for using Nrf2 modulation as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases and autonomic dysfunction. © 2024 Int. Union Physiol. Sci./Am. Physiol. Soc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Mesenchymal stem cells are an innovative therapeutic for various equine orthopaedic diseases, including soft tissue injuries. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tenogenic primed equine allogeneic peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (tpMSCs) in horses with naturally occurring superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL) injuries. Study design: Multicentre, blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Methods: One hundred client-owned horses with SDFT and SL injuries were randomised to receive an intralesional tpMSC (66) or saline (34) injection. Clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation was performed before treatment and on Days 56 ± 3 and 112 ± 3 after treatment. Long-term data on re-injury was collected up to 2 years after treatment. Results: Significantly more tpMSC-treated horses achieved improvement in fibre alignment score (FAS) (100% vs. 54.5%, p < 0.001) and echogenicity (97.0% vs. 57.6%, p < 0.001) on Day 112 ± 3, and their lesion size decreased significantly (−27.6 ± 25.91 vs. −4.6 ± 26.64 mm2, p < 0.001) compared to the placebo group. A FAS = 0 was achieved in 65% of tpMSC-treated horses, as compared to 9% of placebo-treated horses at Day 112 ± 3. The attending veterinarians reported no re-injury in 41 of 53 tpMSC and in 2 of 26 saline-treated horses available for long-term follow-up (p < 0.001). Main limitations: As this study consisted of client-owned horses, no samples for histology were collected. Long-term follow-up was only available for a subset of enrolled horses. Conclusions: The intralesional administration of tpMSCs was safe and improved the quality of healing and long-term outcomes in sports horses with naturally occurring SDFT and suspensory injuries. © 2023 Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica.

ABSTRACT: Abstract—The current stage of genetic certification of horses of cultural and local breeds based on microsatellite analysis makes it possible to quite effectively carry out identification and genetic examination of the origin of breeding animals, as well as solve the problem of assessing and preserving genetic resources. With a reduction in the number of breeding stock to 200–300 mares observed in a number of breeds, the threat of a decrease in the genetic diversity of populations and the accumulation of genetic load increases, which necessitates the need to study and monitor the genetic structure of horse breeds. In this regard, our comparative genetic analysis of polymorphism of 17 microsatellite loci in 20 541 horses of 29 cultural and local breeds allows us to certify the basic part of the genetic resources of the horse breeding of the Russian Federation. including riding, trotter, draft, and local breeds. During the genetic population analysis of the studied breeds, basic parameters were assessed: the total number of allele variants (Na), the effective number of alleles (Ae), the average number of alleles per locus (MNA), the level of observed (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He), as well as the coefficient of intrapopulation inbreeding Fis. Phylogenetic relationships of breeds were assessed using the R and R Studio software packages. Among horse breeds of different specializations, the highest values of all indicators of genetic diversity (Ae, Ho, He, and Na) were determined in aboriginal populations. In the allele pool of local horse breeds, there were rare alleles ASB2T, HMS7S, HMS6J, HMS6H, HMS2T, HMS1O, HTG7L, HTG6L, HTG6H, VHL20S, ASB17Z, ASB17X, ASB17U, LEX3S, LEX3R, and CA425E, which were absent in horses of stud breeds. Among the riding horse breeds created in Russia, the Budennovskaya, Donskaya, and Kabardian horse breeds stood out due to the presence of rare alleles. Alleles ASB2G, ASB2F, HMS2F, HTG7Q, and ASB23O were found in trotter horses, which were not identified in the genetic structure of other breeds. The phylogenetic analysis showed the division of horse breeds into two clear subclusters, the first of which included only stud breeds. The second cluster united all the native breeds, as well as the Orlov Trotter and a group of draft breeds, which were used for many years as improvers of the local horse population. The analysis of the genetic structure of domestic horse breeds revealed a fairly high reserve of diversity even in small populations, which is an indispensable condition for successful selection in horse breeding. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2024.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES To measure the effect of routine vaccination on serum amyloid A (SAA) concentration in apparently healthy horses. We hypothesized that routine vaccination would increase SAA in healthy horses. ANIMALS 21 apparently healthy client-owned horses and 15 Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine–owned horses. METHODS In experiment 1 (n = 8 horses), a blinded, randomized, prospective, crossover study was performed. Horses were either vaccinated (rabies, tetanus, West Nile, Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis, equine herpesvirus-1/-4, influenza) or administered saline, and SAA was measured at 6, 12, and 24 hours and daily until day 10 with a commercial lateral-flow immunoassay. In experiment 2 (n = 28 horses), a prospective, observational study measured SAA after vaccination at 12 and 24 hours and daily until day 10. A linear mixed-effect model with repeated measures over time blocked by horse tested the effect of treatment on SAA. A repeated-measures correlation tested the correlation between SAA and temperature. RESULTS Over time, vaccinated horses had increased model-adjusted SAA compared to unvaccinated horses without clinical evidence of adverse reaction (P < .01). In experiment 1, the model-adjusted SAA after vaccination peaked on day 2 (median, 1,872 µg/mL; IQR, 1,220.8 to 2,402.5 µg/mL) and returned to normal (< 20 µg/mL) by day 9 (median, 6 µg/mL; IQR, 0.8 to 23.5 µg/mL) after vaccination. In experiment 2, vaccinated horses had increased SAA over time; temperature and SAA were not correlated (P = .78). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results of this study indicated that routine vaccination results in increased SAA concentration and provided evidence for a period of convalescence following vaccination. Measuring SAA for 10 days following vaccination cannot be used as an indicator of illness. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Perineural anaesthesia is a useful technique in equine surgery, providing pre-emptive targeted anaesthesia of the surgical site, reducing volatile anaesthetic requirements, improving recovery quality and providing postoperative pain relief. Surgery under standing sedation in horses has increased in popularity, mandating the need for effective locoregional anaesthesia and analgesic techniques. Nerve location techniques offer greater accuracy than blind techniques when placing injectate. These methods can help to avoid structures such as blood vessels and minimise direct nerve damage during needle placement, reducing the risk of procedure-related complications. This review will discuss the most pertinent research in the veterinary literature where objective methods of nerve location have been used to perform peripheral nerve blocks in horses. The efficacy of using objective methods to perform nerve blocks in equine anaesthesia is discussed by the authors, providing useful information to equine anaesthetists, and potentially improve the quality of anaesthesia and analgesia in horses. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Butorphanol is commonly administered, both by the intravenous and intramuscular routes, to racehorses to facilitate handling for diagnostic procedures. As the administration of butorphanol for therapeutic purposes is considered appropriate, in order to avoid inadvertent positive drug tests, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetics of this drug is necessary. In the current study, 12, exercised Thoroughbred horses were administered a single intramuscular dose of 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol, and serum and urine samples were collected at various times post drug administration for determination of butorphanol concentrations using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Serum data were modeled using a nonlinear mixed effect population PK model. The maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) were 139.9 ± 72.8 ng/mL and 0.43 ± 0.44 h (mean ± SD), respectively. Although likely not clinically relevant, but important for drug testing purposes, a prolonged terminal phase was observed, yielding a terminal half-life of 7.67 ± 1.86 h. Using the blood screening limits proposed by the Horseracing Integrity and Welfare Unit, the detection time for intramuscular administration of butorphanol was estimated to be 96 h. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Depredation of domestic horses (Equus caballus) by jaguars (Panthera onca) is an example of human–wildlife conflict that has not received much attention. We monitored spatio-temporal activity and distribution of horses in a 2.64-km2 fenced area in the dry forest of northwestern Costa Rica in response to 16 jaguar killings of horses during January-November 2017. We monitored 4 horses (2 males, 2 females) equipped with global positioning system transmitters from February-September 2018 to identify daily and seasonal patterns of use of cover types and a water source by horses. We then compared these results to the previous locations where jaguars killed horses to identify the circumstances under which horses seemed more vulnerable to jaguar predation. Based on 1,693 locations, horses spent most time in grassland (92%) rather than forest and edge vegetation (8%) and used a core area of 0.74 km2 (kernel density estimation) to 0.86 km2 (minimum convex polygon). Of 16 horse predation events by jaguars, 9 events (56%) occurred in grasslands, 4 in forested areas (25%), and 3 in the forest edge (19%), indicating predation events occurred disproportionately from expected counts based on horse use of vegetation. The predation sites were characterized by a higher proportion of edge and a lower proportion of forest compared to a random points. We suggest that when horses explored areas near the edge of forested areas, the chances of being preyed on by jaguars increased. © 2024 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Vipera berus berus is the only venomous snake present in the Nordic countries and cases of envenomation in horses are reported during the warmer months. Little is known about the presentation, treatment and survival of horses with common European adder envenomation. Clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcome are reported for 28 horses admitted to Helsinki University Equine Hospital in 2008–2023 due to suspicion of snake bite. Eleven of these horses received antivenom treatment. Other common treatments included non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (22/28), antimicrobials (19/28), intravenous fluid therapy (11/28), corticosteroids (9/28) and local treatment (11/28). All horses survived until discharge. No difference was detected in the length of hospital stay between horses with moderate envenomation that had or had not received antivenom treatment. Horses with moderate envenomation are more likely to receive antivenom treatment and require longer hospital stay than horses with mild envenomation. Antivenom treatment is not associated with shorter hospital stay. Little evidence supports the use of corticosteroids and antibiotics in treatment of envenomation. Studies with larger numbers of animals are warranted to evaluate the effect of treatment, including administration of antivenom, on long-term outcome and survival from envenomation. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-exercise L-citrulline supplementation on the athletic performance of Yili speed-racing horses during a high-intensity exercise. On the 20th day of the experiment, blood samples were collected at 3 h and 6 h post-supplementation to measure the amino acid and polyamine concentrations. On the 38th day of the experiment, the horses participated in a 2000 m speed race, and three distinct blood samples were gathered for assessing blood gases, hematological parameters, the plasma biochemistry, antioxidant parameters, and NO concentrations. The results indicate that the L-citrulline group showed a significant increase in the plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations. Conversely, the concentrations of alanine, serine, and threonine were significantly decreased. The glycine concentration decreased significantly, while there was a trend towards an increase in the glutamine concentration. Additionally, the levels of putrescine and spermidine in the plasma of the L-citrulline group were significantly increased. In terms of exercise performance, L-citrulline can improve the exercise performance of sport horses, significantly reduce the immediate post-race lactate levels in Yili horses, and accelerate the recovery of blood gas levels after an exercise. Furthermore, in the L-citrulline group of Yili horses, The levels of the total protein of plasma, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly increased both 2 h before and 2 h after the race. The total antioxidant capacity showed a highly significant increase, while the malondialdehyde content significantly decreased. In the immediate post-race period, the creatinine content in the L-citrulline group significantly increased. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that L-citrulline supplementation can influence the circulating concentrations of L-citrulline and arginine in Yili horses, enhance the antioxidant capacity, reduce lactate levels, and improve physiological and biochemical blood parameters, thereby having a beneficial effect on the exercise performance of athletic horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this review, we explore how pseudotyped viruses (PVs) are being applied to the study of viruses affecting both humans and horses. For the purposes of this review, we define PVs as non-replicative viruses with the core of one virus and the surface protein(s) of another and encapsulating a reporter gene such as luciferase. These ‘reporter’ PVs enable receptor-mediated entry into host cells to be quantified, and thus can be applied to study the initial stages of viral replication. They can also be used to test antiviral activity of compounds and measure envelope protein-specific antibodies in neutralisation tests. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Probiotic microorganisms can stimulate an immune response and increase the efficiency of vaccines. For example, Bacillus toyonensis is a nonpathogenic, Gram-positive bacterium that has been used as a probiotic in animal supplementation. It induces immunomodulatory effects and increases the vaccine response in several species. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of B. toyonensis supplementation on the modulation of the immune response in horses vaccinated with recombinant Clostridium tetani toxin. Twenty horses were vaccinated twice, with an interval of 21 days between doses, and equally divided into two groups: the first group was supplemented orally for 42 days with feed containing viable spores of B. toyonensis (1 × 108) mixed with molasses (40 ml), starting 7 days before the first vaccination; the second (control) group received only feed mixed with molasses, starting 7 days before the first vaccination. Serum samples were collected to evaluate the humoral immune response using an in-house indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected to evaluate cytokine transcription (qPCR). For the specific IgG-anti-rTENT titer, the supplemented group had ELISA values that were four times higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05). The supplemented group also showed higher ELISA values for the IgGa and IgGT sub-isotypes compared to the control group. In PBMCs stimulated with B. toyonensis, relative cytokine transcription of the supplemented group showed 15-, 8-, 7-, and 6-fold increases for IL1, TNFα, IL10 and IL4, respectively. When stimulated with a vaccine antigen, the supplemented group showed 1.6-, 1.8-, and 0.5-fold increases in IL1, TNFα, and IL4, respectively, compared to the control group. Horses supplemented with B. toyonensis had a significantly improved vaccine immune response compared to those in the control group, which suggests a promising approach for improving vaccine efficacy with probiotics. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This report describes the successful treatment of a cutaneous haemangiosarcoma in a 12-year-old horse presented for evaluation of a cutaneous mass on the left gluteal region. The horse was treated by complete large surgical excision of the neoplastic tissue. A good cosmetic outcome as well as a short recovery time was achieved with an autologous skin grafting split thickness modified Meek technique. A long-term follow-up of the patient showed no reoccurrence of the haemangiosarcoma and a successful return to athletic performance. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first equine primary cutaneous haemangiosarcoma treated with complete excision and subsequently autologous skin grafting with a long-term follow-up and good outcome despite the poor prognosis. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To compare 3 perioperative feeding regimens and their effect on anesthetic complications, manure output, and colic proportion in healthy horses. METHODS 45 horses presenting for elective orthopedic procedures were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: not fasted (NF; continuous access to hay perioperatively), fasted muzzled (FM; 10-hour preoperative fast with slow refeeding postoperatively and muzzle placement), or fasted not muzzled (FNM; same as FM without muzzle placement). Anesthetic protocol was standardized. Outcomes compared between groups included anesthesia time, arterial oxygenation, duration of hypotension, perioperative manure output, time to first passage of manure postoperatively, pain scores, and colic proportion. Comparisons were made with a mixed model and Fisher exact test with statistical significance considered at P ≤ .05. RESULTS No differences were seen in pain scores, oxygenation, hypotension, or colic between groups. Groups FM and FNM had a significantly greater mean reduction in postoperative manure weight (-81% and -70%; P = .003) and number of manure piles (-63% and -55%; P = .005) compared to group NF (-39% and -22%; P < .001; weight and piles, respectively). Mean ± SD minutes to passage of manure postoperatively was significantly shorter in group NF (238 ± 13 minutes) than groups FM (502 ± 174 minutes; P < .001) and FNM (444 ± 171 minutes; P = .003). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Horses with continuous access to hay prior to and following recovery from anesthesia passed more manure and passed manure sooner after surgery than their fasted counterparts without detrimental effect on anesthetic parameters and postoperative complications. Continuous access to hay perioperatively supports manure production in healthy horses without increase in anesthetic complications. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: This article describes the molecular mechanism by which tetraalkylammonium chloride ([R4N]Cl: R- = methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (Pr),butyl (Bu)) modulates the stability, folding, and dynamics of cytochrome c (Cyt c). Analysis of [R4N]Cl effects on thermal/chemical denaturations, millisecond refolding/unfolding kinetics, and slow CO-association kinetics of Cyt c without and with denaturant providing some significant results: (i) [R4N]Cl decreasing the unfolding free energy estimated by thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of thermal/chemical denaturation curves and kinetic chevrons (Log kobs-[GdmCl]) of Cyt c, respectively (ii) hydrophobicity of R-group of [R4N]Cl, preferential inclusion of [R4N]Cl at the protein surface, and destabilizing enthalpic attractive interactions of [Me4N]Cl and steric entropic interactions of [Et4N]Cl,[Pr4N]Cl and [Bu4N]Cl with protein contribute to [R4N]Cl-induced decrease thermodynamic stability of Cyt c (iii) [R4N]Cl exhibits an additive effect with denaturant to decrease thermodynamic stability and refolding rates of Cyt c (iv) low concentrations of [R4N]Cl (≤ 0.5 M) constrain the motional dynamics while the higher concentrations (>0.75 M [R4N]Cl) enhance the structural-fluctuations that denture protein (v) hydrophobicity of R-group of [R4N]Cl alters the [denaturant]-dependent conformational stability, refolding-unfolding kinetics, and CO-association kinetics of Cyt c. Furthermore, the MD simulations depicted that the addition of 1.0 M of [R4N]Cl increased the conformational fluctuations in Cyt c leading to decreased structural stability in the order [Me4N]Cl < [Et4N]Cl < [Pr4N]Cl < [Bu4N]Cl consistent with the experimental results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Clinicopathological findings and their association with the outcome and development of laminitis in horses with acute diarrhoea has not been investigated in a multicentre study across different geographic regions. Objectives: Describe and compare clinicopathologic findings of diarrhoeic horses between different geographic regions, survival rates and factors associated with non-survival and laminitis. Study design: Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods: Information from horses with acute diarrhoea presenting to participating institutions between 2016 and 2020 was collected, and clinicopathological data were compared between surviving and non-surviving horses and horses that did and did not develop laminitis. Survival rates and seasonal and geographic differences were also investigated. Results: One thousand four hundred thirty-eight horses from 26 participating institutions from 4 continents were included; 76% survived to discharge with no differences identified between geographic regions. The survival proportion of horses with SIRS and creatinine concentrations > 159 μmol/L was 55% (154/279) compared with 81% (358/437) for those with SIRS and creatinine concentrations < 159 μmol/L (p < 0.001). The survival proportion of horses with SIRS that had an L-lactate concentration > 2.8 mmol/L was 59% (175/298) compared with 81% (240/296) in horses with SIRS and L-lactate concentration < 2.8 mmol/L (p < 0.001). The proportion of horses that developed laminitis was lower in Europe (4%, 19/479) compared with North America (8%, 52/619), Australia (8%, 12/138) and Latin America (11%, 16/146) (p < 0.05). More horses developed laminitis in the summer (46%, 39/85) compared with winter (18%, 15/85), spring (18%, 15/85) and fall (19%, 16/85) (p < 0.01). Horses with laminitis had greater odds of non-survival than those without laminitis (OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 2.47–5.65). Main limitations: Not all variables were available for all horses due to the retrospective nature. Conclusions: Clinicopathological findings in horses with acute diarrhoea and their association with survival are similar across geographic regions. However, developing laminitis secondary to diarrhoea is less common in Europe. In addition, factors associated with non-survival were indicative of disease severity and subsequent cardiovascular compromise. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To compare the efficacy of inhaled salbutamol with salmeterol for the treatment of arterial hypoxaemia in anaesthetized horses. Study design: Prospective, randomized, clinical study. Animals: A total of 108 client-owned horses (American Society of Anesthesiologists status I–V) anaesthetized for elective and emergency procedures. Methods: Horses were premedicated with acepromazine [intramuscularly 0.1 mg kg–1 or intravenously (IV) 0.05 mg kg–1] and xylazine (0.6 mg kg–1 IV). Midazolam (0.06 mg kg–1 IV) and ketamine (2.2 mg kg–1 IV) were combined to induce anaesthesia, and isoflurane in oxygen/air mixture (inspired oxygen fraction 0.7) was used for maintenance of anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was initiated without delay using the following ventilator settings: tidal volume 10 mL kg–1, respiratory rate 8 breaths minute–1, inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio 1:2, no positive end-expiratory pressure. If arterial blood gas analysis revealed PaO2 < 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa), the administration of either inhaled salbutamol (2 μg kg–1) or salmeterol (0.5 μg kg–1) was randomly assigned Blood gas analysis was repeated 15 and 30 minutes after treatment. The intervention was considered successful when PaO2 after treatment ≥ 1.2 × PaO2 before treatment (i.e. ≥20% increase). PaO2 at 15 and 30 minutes was compared between groups using Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Of the 108 horses, 60 were administered salbutamol, 65% and 60% responded successfully at 15 and 30 minutes, increasing their initial PaO2 by 38% and 44%, respectively. The other 48 horses were administered salmeterol, 35% responded successfully at 15 and 30 minutes, increasing their initial PaO2 by 3% and 4%, respectively. PaO2 was significantly higher after salbutamol than after salmeterol at 15 and 30 minutes. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Using the described protocol, inhaled salbutamol was more effective than salmeterol in improving PaO2 in anaesthetized horses with value < 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa). © 2024 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: Repeated exposure to water treadmill (WT) exercise could elicit kinematic responses reflecting adaptation to WT exercise. The study’s aim was to compare the responses of a group of sport horses to a standardised WT exercise test (WTSET) carried out at three time points, week 0 (n = 48), week 20 (n = 38), and week 40 (n = 29), throughout a normal training programme incorporating WT exercise. Horses were recruited from the existing client populations of two commercial water treadmill venues for the purpose of this longitudinal, observational study. Limb, back, poll, wither, and pelvic kinematics were measured during the WTSET using videography, optical motion capture, and inertial motion sensors. Forelimb and hindlimb protraction increased (p < 0.001 for both), and forelimb and hindlimb retraction decreased (p < 0.001 for both) at week 40 compared to week 0. Caudal thoracic flexion–extension and lateral bend ranges of movement were greater at week 40 compared to week 0 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively). Increased training speed was associated with increased craniocaudal poll movement (p = 0.021), decreased forelimb protraction (p = 0.008), and increased forelimb retraction (p = 0.021). In addition to characteristic changes in kinematics due to increasing water depth, regular WT exercise resulted in kinematic adaptation to movement in water. Factors such as the frequency of WT sessions and the type of session used with respect to depth and speed were seen to influence the nature of the adaptation. The results suggest that WT exercise sessions could be designed in accordance with specific training goals when used within a normal sport horse training programme. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cardiac catheterizations in horses are mainly performed in the right heart, as access to the left heart traditionally requires an arterial approach. Transseptal puncture (TSP) has been adapted for horses but data on follow-up and closure of the iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD) are lacking. Hypothesis/Objectives: To perform TSP and assess postoperative complications and iASD closure over a minimum of 4 weeks. Animals: Eleven healthy adult horses. Methods: Transseptal puncture was performed under general anesthesia. Serum cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured before and after puncture. Weekly, iASD closure was monitored using transthoracic and intracardiac echocardiography. Relationship between activated clotting time and anti-factor Xa activity during postoperative enoxaparin treatment was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Results: Transseptal puncture was successfully achieved in all horses within a median duration of 22 (range, 10-104) minutes. Balloon dilatation of the puncture site for sheath advancement was needed in 4 horses. Atrial arrhythmias occurred in 9/11 horses, including atrial premature depolarizations (N = 1), atrial tachycardia (N = 5), and fibrillation (N = 3). Serum cardiac troponin I concentrations increased after TSP, but remained under the reference value in 10/11 horses. Median time to iASD closure was 14 (1-35) days. Activated clotting time correlated with anti-factor Xa activity in vitro but not in vivo. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Transseptal puncture was successfully performed in all horses. The technique was safe and spontaneous iASD closure occurred in all horses. Clinical application of TSP will allow characterization and treatment of left-sided arrhythmias in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The advanced-PRF+ (A-PRF+) is a platelet concentrate, showing a higher concentration of growth factors, an increased number of cells and looser structure of the fibrin clot than leukocyte-PRF. A high variability in the size of PRF associated with patients, haematological features and centrifugation protocols was reported. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of A-PRF+ production in the field and the correlation between haematological parameters, macroscopic and microscopic features in equine A-PRF+. Samples from twenty Standardbred horses (3–7 years) were harvested with glass tubes without anticoagulants, previously heated at 37 °C. Blood samples were centrifugated at 1300 rpm for 8 min with a fixed-angle centrifuge and a horizontal centrifuge in the field, at a temperature of 15–17 °C. Clots were measured and placed on the Wound Box® for a 2-min compression. Membranes were measured and fixed in 10% formalin for histological examination. Clot and membrane surface did not differ between sex and centrifuge. Haematological parameters did not show a significant correlation to clot and membrane size. Membranes obtained from both centrifugation protocols showed a loose fibrin structure and cells evenly distributed throughout the clot. Tubes' warming was effective to obtain A-PRF+ clots from all samples, regardless the environmental temperature. Further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of other blood molecules on the A-PRF+ structure and size. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Congenital heart defects (CHDs) can have profound and potentially life-threatening consequences on horses' health and performance capability. While CHDs are rare in the general horse population, the Arabian breed is disproportionately overrepresented and thus is widely suspected to be genetically predisposed. This review discusses the most common CHDs in Arabian horses, including ventricular septal defect (VSD), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), patent duct arteriosus (PDA), tricuspid valve atresia (TVA) and atrial septal defect (ASD). This review also explores how future research into the genetic factors that likely underpin many CHDs can revolutionise the way these disorders are managed in Arabian horses. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine practitioners frequently inject local anaesthetics (LA) intra-articularly in both diagnosis of lameness and for pain management intra- or post-operatively with synovial endoscopy. Recent reviews of the human and veterinary literature support the concept that chondrotoxicity of LA on joint tissues depends on the type of drug, dose administered, and duration of exposure. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current literature describing intra-articular local anaesthetic use, including both in vitro and in vivo studies, and to draw some comparisons to literature from other species where potential toxicity and duration of effect have been evaluated with the goal of advancing the field's understanding of intra-articular local anaesthetic use in horses, and indicating future directions for the field. The aggregate data available from all species, while generally sparse for horses, indicate that LA are rapidly cleared from the synovial fluid after injection, often within 30 min. In vitro data strongly suggest that lidocaine and bupivacaine are likely more chondrotoxic than other LA, although to what extent is still unknown, and cytotoxicity of LA may be mitigated through concurrent injection with HA, PRP, and drug combinations including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and opioids. The current body of in vitro research is not reflective of the in vivo environment, and further in vitro work, if performed, should focus on mimicking the native joint environment, utilising PK data and joint/injection volumes to replicate the native environment more accurately within the joint and the expected exposures to LA. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Repair of sagittal proximal phalanx (P1) and parasagittal metacarpal/metatarsal III (MC/MTIII) fractures has evolved over recent decades from a procedure carried out solely under general anaesthesia, to one commonly performed under standing sedation. To date, standing fracture repair has not been evaluated for large cohorts. Objectives: To determine short-term (survival to discharge) and long-term (return to racing) outcomes of horses undergoing standing repair of MC/MTIII and P1 fractures, and to compare pre-surgical and post-surgical racing performance. Study design: Single-centre retrospective cohort study. Methods: Retrospective clinical record review of 245 cases undergoing standing repair of MC/MTIII or P1 fractures, 1 January 2007–30 June 2021. Data on signalment, fracture configuration and complications were collected and full race records were retrieved from the Racing Post Database (wwww.racingpost.com). Chi-squared and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to determine any difference in variables between horses that raced after surgery compared to those that did not. McNemar change and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare pre- and post-surgical racing performance, p ≤ 0.05. Results: Ninety-eight percent [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.2%–99.7%] of horses survived hospital discharge, and 75.1% (95% CI: 68.9%–81.4%) raced after surgery, a median of 241 days later. Horses that raced post-surgery were significantly less likely to have suffered from complications during hospitalisation than those that did not race again [17.3% (95% CI: 11%–24%) vs. 36.5% (95% CI: 23%–50%), p = 0.005]. Comparing pre- and post-operative racing performance, there was no significant difference in earnings per start [median £628.00, interquartile range (IQR) 115.90–1934.80 vs. £653.20, 51.00–1886.40, p = 0.7] or proportion of horses winning [51% (95% CI: 41%–61%) vs. 54% (95% CI: 44%–64%), p = 0.8] or being placed first–third [77% (95% CI: 68%–85%) vs. 71% (95% CI: 62%–80%, p = 0.5] in at least one race. Main limitations: Retrospective nature of study with reliance on clinical records and public databases, limiting data available for analysis. Conclusions: Standing fracture repair is a viable treatment option for MC/MTIII or P1 fractures that returns horses to the racetrack within an acceptable time frame and is capable of restoring pre-surgical athletic ability. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: An 18-month-old Standardbred colt, referred for hock joint arthroscopy, presented a severe left forelimb lameness immediately after recovery from general anaesthesia. The horse was found in the recovery box with a ‘dropped elbow’, and it was dragging the leg. Radiographic examination of the shoulder showed a displaced avulsion fracture of the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. A human distal femoral locking plate was customised using measurements taken from a computed tomography scan of a 2-year-old horse specimen. An internal fixation of the fracture was performed using the designed distal femoral locking plate. Rehabilitation techniques were passive manipulations and neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Six months post-operatively, the horse was sound and had made a complete functional recovery. The distal femoral locking plate fitted well to the supraglenoid tubercle and scapula in the operated horse, leading to a stable fixation. The recovery time was shortened using internal fixation, which facilitated a faster return to mobility. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Mastication is the initial phase of digestion and is crucial to equine health due to its role in saliva production and food particle reduction. Hay nets have been promoted to slow the rate of hay consumption, with many styles of slow feeders available. Limited research has shown that nets may slow consumption, but no research has examined their effect on the horse's chewing frequency and patterns. The objective of this study was to compare chew frequency (CF, total number of chews/kg consumed) and chew duration (CD, total minutes chewed/kg consumed), as well as distribution of chews over a feeding period, of horses eating bermudagrass hay in three styles of hay nets [large mesh (LM), small mesh (SM), bottom hole (BH)] as compared to a control of loose hay (CTL). Treatments were assigned in a replicated Latin square 4 × 4 using eight horses. Horses were given a 24-hr acclimation period prior to recording their chewing patterns over a 24-hr period using an automated halter fit with a pressure-sensor noseband. Results indicate that CF was not influenced by treatment. However, SM resulted in longer CD as compared to CTL (P = 0.007). Additionally, BH resulted in a higher percentage of chews completed in the first 240 min compared to SM (P = 0.039), indicating more rapid consumption. Results of this study indicate hay nets may not influence the number of chews a horse performs while masticating hay, but small mesh feeders may increase the CD and reduce early consumption rate. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The reproductive performance of horse sperm and donkey sperm has been reported to differ. Sperm proteins play a crucial role in sperm viability and fertility. Although differences between species are known, no prior study has investigated disparities in the sperm proteome between horses and donkeys. Therefore, this study characterized and compared the sperm proteomes of horses and donkeys using 4D-DIA mass spectrometry technology. We identified 3436 proteins in horse sperm and 3404 proteins in donkey sperm. Of these, 3363 proteins were expressed in both horse and donkey sperm, with 73 proteins being specifically expressed in horse sperm, and 41 in donkey sperm. According to data analysis, donkeys exhibited a greater percentage of motility and progressive movement in straight-line sperm than horses, as well as lower percentages of static and slow sperm than horses. Joint analysis of the results from the horse and donkey sperm proteomes and their CEROS II-read parameters demonstrated a possible association between sperm proteins and their sperm viability patterns. These findings suggest that there are discrepancies in the expression levels and protein compositions of horse and donkey sperm and that certain specific proteins may be responsible for the differences in performance between these two species. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: An 8-year-old American Quarter Horse gelding was treated with extracorporeal hemoperfusion (HP) therapy for treatment of Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The gelding developed C. difficile associated peracute colitis and severe SIRS as evidenced by a positive fecal C. difficile PCR and tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, neutropenia, altered mucous membrane color, and hyperlactatemia. Concurrent acute kidney injury in the horse limited the use of routine anti-inflammatory and anti-lipopolysaccharide treatments, including flunixin meglumine and polymyxin B, because of potential for nephrosis. Extracorporeal HP therapy was performed twice within 48 hours of the onset of severe SIRS during which the horse's physical examination variables stabilized. The horse was euthanized after 4 days because of laminitis. These findings support further investigation of extracorporeal HP therapy as an adjunctive treatment for severe SIRS/sepsis in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding normal microbial populations within areas of the respiratory tract is essential, as variable regional conditions create different niches for microbial flora, and proliferation of commensal microbes likely contributes to clinical respiratory disease. The objective was to describe microbial population variability between respiratory tract locations in healthy horses. Samples were collected from four healthy adult horses by nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL), transtracheal aspirate (TTA), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of six distinct regions within the lung. Full-length 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and microbial profiling analysis was performed. There was a large amount of diversity, with over 1797 ASVs identified, reduced to 94 taxa after tip agglomeration and prevalence filtering. Number of taxa and diversity were highly variable across horses, sample types, and BAL locations. Firmicutes, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the predominant phyla. There was a significant difference in richness (Chao1, p = 0.02) and phylogenetic diversity (FaithPD, p = 0.01) between NPL, TTA, and BAL. Sample type (p = 0.03) and horse (p = 0.005) contributed significantly to Bray-Curtis compositional diversity, while Weighted Unifrac metric was only affected by simplified sample type (NPL and TTA vs BAL, p = 0.04). There was no significant effect of BAL locations within the lung with alpha or beta diversity statistical tests. Overall findings support diverse microbial populations that were variable between upper and lower respiratory tract locations, but with no apparent difference in microbial populations of the six biogeographic regions of the lung, suggesting that BAL fluid obtained blindly by standard clinical techniques may be sufficient for future studies in healthy horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Many sport horse studbooks worldwide use microsatellite markers for parentage verification. However, many have expressed a desire to introduce genomic selection using genome-wide dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes to complement their current breeding programmes. Hence, it does not make sense to genotype the same animal for both microsatellite markers and SNP markers. Transitioning to SNP-based parentage verification is an obvious solution but one barrier to this transition is the lack of SNP data on parents from which to verify parentage against. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the ability to impute the SNP genotype of a stallion from the genotypes of its progeny, with or without the consideration of the genotype of the progeny's dam. Genotype information from 55 935 SNPs was available on 13 327 horses. A total of 98 stallions had genotype data on 10 progeny and the genotypes of these stallions were used as a test population. Genome-wide genotype imputation was undertaken by combining a family- and population-based imputation approach. Several different scenarios were assessed to quantify the ability to accurately impute the genotype of a stallion based on genotype data of incrementally more half-sibling progeny. Using genomic information from four progeny the average genotype concordance of the imputed sire genotype compared to the actual sire's genotype was 0.932. The average genotype concordance rate increased to 0.960 when the genotypes of 10 progeny were included in the imputation process. The inclusion of the genotypes of the dams of the progeny improved the concordance rate from 0.932 to 0.977 when based on the genotype of just four progeny and their dams and from 0.960 to 0.996 when based on the genotype of 10 progeny and their dams. These results suggest it is possible to impute the genotype of a non-genotyped horse from the genotypes of its progeny and that the inclusion of the genotypes of the dams of the progeny improves this imputation accuracy further. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Plant bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum results in huge losses. Accordingly, developing an effective control method for this disease is urgently required. Filamentous phages, which do not lyse host bacteria and exert minimal burden, offer a potential biocontrol solution. A filamentous phage RSCq that infects R. solanacearum was isolated in this study through genome mining. We constructed engineered filamentous phages based on RSCq by employing our proposed approach with wide applicability to non-model phages, enabling the exogenous genes delivery into bacterial cells. CRISPRAsCas12f1 is a miniature class 2 type V-F CRISPR-Cas system. A CRISPR-AsCas12f1-based gene editing system that targets the key virulence regulator gene hrpB was developed, generating the engineered phage RSCqCRISPR-Cas. Similar to the Greek soldiers in the Trojan Horse, our findings demonstrated that the engineered phage-delivered CRISPR-Cas system could disarm the key “weapon,” hrpB, of R. solanacearum, in medium and plants. Remarkably, pretreatment with RSCqCRISPR-Cas significantly controlled tobacco bacterial wilt, highlighting the potential of engineered filamentous phages as promising biocontrol agents against plant bacterial diseases.

ABSTRACT: The esbarrada and volta sobre patas manoeuvres are critical in Criollo horse equestrian activities, yet their kinematics remain largely unexplored. This observational study aimed to kinematically describe the manoeuvres in Criollo breed horses and explore the relationship between static goniometry and dynamics. A 2D kinematic analysis was conducted on 31 Criollo horses performing the manoeuvres using high-speed cameras. Joint angles were measured using static goniometry and analysed in relation to dynamic performance. The esbarrada covered a distance of 4.28 ± 0.99 m in 1.15 ± 0.11 s at a velocity of 3.77 ± 0.55 m/s. Joint angles showed a mean fetlock extension of 75.4° ± 5.3° and hock flexion of 43.2° ± 4.1°. In the volta sobre patas, significant differences were found in turn duration (first: 0.96 ± 0.07 s, second: 1.12 ± 0.09 s, p = 0.03) and thoracic limb suspension (first: 0.23 ± 0.02 s, second: 0.28 ± 0.03 s, p = 0.02). Static goniometry indicated that limb conformation did not significantly correlate with protraction angles during the esbarrada (p = 0.27). The volta sobre patas demonstrated prolonged duration and increased thoracic limb suspension in the second turn. Also, the findings suggest that static conformation does not predict dynamic limb movement during the esbarrada. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine primary iris cysts are usually incidental findings but, if associated with clinical signs, may require intervention. The use of laser (Nd:Yag or diode) has been reported but requires specialised equipment. Transcorneal aspiration has not been previously evaluated in the standing horse. Objectives: To review outcomes of standing transcorneal aspiration of primary iris cysts (STAPIC) in horses. Methods: Horses were identified from electronic patient records from 2018 to 2024 across four collaborating centres. Clinical presentation and outcomes were identified and reported using descriptive statistics. Results: Eighteen horses were identified. Behavioural signs reported included ‘spooking’ and changes in rideability often associated with jumping. Single large unilateral cysts were present in 11 horses, bilateral cysts in three horses and multiple unilateral cysts in four horses. Following treatment, one horse developed uveitis and fibrin in the anterior chamber associated with needle contact with the iris stroma due to movement, and a second horse developed fibrin within the anterior chamber. Both conditions resolved with anti-inflammatory medication and administration of tissue plasminogen activator. No other adverse effects were reported. Follow-up was available from all horses (median: 6 months, interquartile range [IQR]: 4–11 months) with no recurrence, although one horse developed an iris cyst in the contralateral eye after 3 years. All owners reported improvement in clinical signs, with 61% reporting no further signs. Conclusions: STAPIC is an effective and easily accessible alternative for treating iris cysts in horses rarely associated with complications. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Morphological scoring is a common evaluation method for domestic animals. The National Association of Maremmano Breeders (ANAM) has provided a dataset containing the records of 600 horses, four metric measurements (cm) and 24 traits with a continuous evaluation scale, each one with 15 classes. Moreover, a body condition score (BCS) with five classes is included. In this study, factor analysis was conducted to create a small number of informative factors (3) obtained from these traits, and a new BLUP-AM-MT index was established. The New Estimated Breeding Value (NEBV1) of each horse was computed by adding the genetic indexes of the three factors, with each one multiplied using a coefficient indicated by ANAM. The practical feasibility of the NEBV1 was evaluated through Spearman correlations between the rankings of the NEBV1 and the rankings of the BLUP-AM-MT, estimated through the four biometric measures and the morphological score (MS) assigned to each horse by the ANAM judges. The factorial analysis was used to estimate three factors: the “Trunk Dimension”, “Legs” and “Length”. As the explained variance was only 32%, the model was rotated, and the heritability of the three factors were 0.51, 0.05 and 0.41, respectively. After rotation, the estimated correlations between the new NEBV1 and the biometric measures were improved. These results should encourage breeders to adopt a breeding value index that takes into consideration the factors derived from all the variables observed in the morphological evaluation of the Maremmano. In this way, breeders can use it to select the best animals for breeding. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses are regularly transported in the United States (U.S.); however, how, and why horses travel by road has not been explored. Consequently, an online nationwide survey was conducted to understand 1) the most common reasons for travel; 2) the types of journeys undertaken when being transported by road in the U.S. and 3) the general management practices when transporting for 3 h or less. Responses were collected from 1294 participants with at least one response from every state in the continental U.S. The most common survey taker was a female (93.9 %), adult amateur (81.2 %), horse owner (64.6 %) who rode recreationally (33.1 %) and transported their own horse (79.4 %). The most common reasons for travel were for trail or leisure riding (34.2 %) followed by showing and competition (25.3 %); however, this varied by discipline. The most common trip duration was less than one hour (46.8 %), with only 12.4 % of the most common trip durations being 4 h or more. The most common specific horse transported by road for 3 h or less was an adult (age 5-15; 59.0 %), Quarter Horse (21.2 %), used for pleasure or trail riding (44.3 %). The biggest concern when transporting was injury to the horse (26.7 %), whilst the biggest factor when planning to travel was the weather (24.1 %). These results provide insight into why horses are being transported by road in the U.S. and that it is more common to transport horses for shorter durations. © 2024

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to optimize an MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for imaging the plantar nerves at the level of the tarsus in normal equine limbs. SAMPLE 12 pelvic cadaver limbs from horses without evidence of proximal suspensory pathology were imaged with a 3T MRI system. METHODS For diffusion-weighted imaging, b values of 600, 800, and 1,000 s/mm2 were tested. Data were processed with DSI Studio. Cross-sectional areas of the medial and lateral plantar nerve along the plantar tarsus were recorded. The length and number of fiber tracts, signal-to-noise ratio, and DTI variables were recorded. RESULTS At the level of interest, the mean cross-sectional areas of the plantar nerves ranged from 5.03 to 7.42 mm2. The DTI maps consistently generated tracts in the region of the lateral and medial plantar nerves with DTI values in the range of values reported for peripheral nerves in humans. Our findings demonstrate that DTI of the medial and lateral plantar nerves can be performed successfully and used to generate quantitative parameters including fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Quantitative data generated with this imaging technique can be used to noninvasively characterize the microstructural integrity of neural tissue with possible applications in the evaluation of pathologic changes to the plantar tarsal and metatarsal nerves of horses with proximal suspensory desmopathy. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: The spatial ecology of feral horses (Equus ferus f. caballus) in Greece has never been studied before, including home range size and habitat selection. We tracked two mares fitted with global positioning system collars between September 2020 and August 2021 in a portion of Mount Menoikio in Central Macedonia, Northern Greece. We used K-select analysis to assess habitat selection for the study period by combining location data with several environmental variables. The mean home ranges for horses varied from 26.72 km2 (95% Minimum Convex Polygon; SE = 0.442) to 27.84 km2 (95% Kernel Density; SE = 1.83). Both horses selected areas with flat and smooth topography near natural grasslands with high green productivity. Conversely, they avoided areas near broadleaved forests and pastures, as well as at north-facing aspects. Overall, suitable habitats corresponded to a small portion (15.1%) of the available habitat. Our findings could assist land managers in mapping primary horses’ habitat in the wider region and implement management regimes that will aid in preserving natural grasslands. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are important epigenetic modification during spermatogenesis. To further evaluate the pattern of DNMTs in horse testes during development, we investigated the expression and localization of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b at different time points. The qRT-PCR results showed that DNMT1 expression was maintained in testes tissue from 6-month-old (0.5y) to 2-year-old (2y) of age and decreased after 3-year-old (3y) (P < 0.01). The expression levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b peaked in testes tissue at 3y (P < 0.01). At 4-year-old (4y), the expression of DNMT3a and DNMT3b was decreased and became similar to that at 0.5y. Immunofluorescence of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b on testis samples confirmed the differential expression and localization of these three DNA methylation transferases during horse development. Further molecular biological studies are needed to understand the implications of the expression patterns of these DNMTs in horse testes. © 2024

ABSTRACT: This study conducted transcriptome sequencing on the skeletal muscles of three different anatomical locations across various growth stages to investigate the impact of ages on crucial candidate genes and molecular mechanisms associated with muscle development in Kazakh horses. Sixteen Kazakh horses were selected, and they were divided into four age groups, each with four biological replicates. Tissue samples from the longest dorsal muscle, abdominal muscle, and diaphragm muscle were collected for analysis. The results revealed differential mRNA expression in the longest dorsal muscle between the eight-month group (Group O) and the 10-year group (Group F), with 434 up-regulated and 322 down-regulated genes. In the abdominal muscle, there were 125 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated genes, while in the diaphragm muscle, there were 73 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated genes. In this study, GO enrichment analysis focused on biological processes. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted the Oxidative Phosphorylation pathway for the longest dorsal muscle, annotating 37 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including ATP5PF, NDUFB8, and ATP5MG, all of which were down-regulated. For the abdominal muscle, the ECM-receptor interaction pathway was enriched, annotating 7 DEGs such as COL4A2, COL4A1, and ITGA5. In the diaphragm muscle, the Hippo signaling pathway was enriched, annotating 6 DEGs, including SERPINE1, RASSF1, and FZD10. This study provides robust data support and a theoretical foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the influence of age on skeletal muscle development in horses. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Clodronic acid is designated as a controlled medication for competition horses by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports and, according to the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, clodronic acid is not to be administered to racehorses younger than 3.5 years or within 30 days prior to a race. In this study, 35 horses involved in competition were treated with a single dose of 1.53 mg clodronic acid/kg bodyweight intramuscularly. Plasma samples were obtained before treatment and 10, 20, 30, and 40 days post-administration. Clodronic acid concentrations were measured using a validated method, and the data were fitted using a nonlinear mixed effects model. The estimated depletion half-life of clodronic acid was 10.6 days (inter-individual variability: 17.9%). Age, body weight, sex, disease severity, dose, training days, training, and competition did not significantly impact the depletion half-life. The percentage of horses predicted via simulation to have clodronic acid concentrations below the assay's limit of quantification of 1.0 ng/mL was 93.9% at day 30 and 99.4% at Day 40. This study provides rationale to the equestrian federations and horse racing authorities to reliably establish a detection time for clodronic acid, assisting equine veterinarians in recommending a competition withdrawal time for the horses under their care. © 2024 GIE LCH.

ABSTRACT: The Kushum horse breed is very popular in Kazakhstan due to its adaptability to local conditions and high meat and dairy qualities. Obtaining new intra-breed types of this breed is necessary to improve the genetic potential and achieve high indicators of meat and dairy productivity. The purpose of this study was to develop a new intra-breed type “Mamyr-Aktobe”. Breeding work was carried out with the following livestock of the producing composition n=318, including stallions 18 animal units, mares – 300 units. The genealogical structure of promising branches of breeding lines of Kushum horses has been analysed, and their meat and milk parameters were evaluated. Adult stallions of the new intra-breed type have high measurements and live weight: the average height at the withers is 157.9cm, the oblique length of the trunk is 163.5cm, the chest and pastern girth are 205.2 and 22cm, respectively, the live weight is 656.2kg, and the massiveness index is 149.3%. For mares, the average height at the withers is 152.5cm, the indicator of the oblique length of the trunk is 160.2cm. The circumference of the chest and pastern is 188.7 and 20cm, respectively. On average, mares of the new intra-breed type weigh 529kg, and their massiveness index is 139%. Based on these characteristics, the new intra-breed type “Mamyr-Aktobe” can be used to improve the breeding qualities of the Kushum horse breed, as well as in meat and dairy farming. © 2024, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Background: Transrectal ultrasonography is the best technique for evaluating the ventral aspect of the lumbosacral and sacroiliac regions yet this diagnostic technique does not always lead to a final diagnosis of back pain in horses. Objectives: To describe anatomical variations and acquired pathological bony changes (APBCs) in the lumbosacral and sacroiliac regions detected by ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) examinations on specimens. We hypothesised that age, body mass, previous use and anatomical variations may be correlated with the presence and/or severity of APBCs. Study design: Descriptive cadaver study. Methods: Lumbosacroiliac specimens were obtained from 51 horses that died or were euthanised for reasons other than the study and underwent US and CT examinations post-mortem. Results: Forty-two specimens were analysed. The most prevalent lumbosacral disc morphology was type 2 (21/42), and protrusions were found in 15/42 specimens. Abnormal echogenicity of the L5-L6 and lumbosacral discs was detected in 11/42 and 30/42 specimens, respectively. Abnormalities in the size of the L5-L6 disc were found in 10/42 specimens and correlated with promontorium localisation (Cramér's V coefficient [V] = 0.42) and lumbosacral disc morphology (type 1: V = 0.41; type 5: V = 0.69). The most prevalent orientation of the L6 spinous process (SP) was convergent (24/42). The promontoria were mostly located between L6 and S1 (36/42). Lumbosacral spondylosis was detected in 24/42 specimens and spondylolisthesis in one. Age was associated with the severity of APBCs in the sacroiliac joints, lumbosacral intertransverse joints, articular process joints, spondylosis and L6 or S1 bone plate irregularities. Lumbosacral spondylosis or L6 extremitas caudalis irregularity was associated with lumbosacral angulation, variability in the size of the L5-L6 disc and localisation of the promontorium, L6 SP orientation and L6 extremitas caudalis irregularity with abnormal echogenicity of the LS disc. Main limitations: Lack of information on clinical signs. Conclusions: High variability and prevalence of the anatomical variations and APBCs in the lumbosacroiliac region were observed, and correlations between some anatomical variations and APBCs and between APBCs and age were reported. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Intra-articular corticosteroids are a popular treatment choice for joint-associated pain and inflammation in horses despite recent work on the metabolic effects of these drugs. The goal of this project was to compare metabolic effects between intra-articular (IA) triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and an autologous protein solution (APS). Five mixed-breed geldings (4–9 years) were utilized for this project. Three identical and consecutive 28-day treatment blocks were used, with metacarpophalangeal IA treatments consisting of equal volumes of saline, a commercially available APS, or 9 mg of TA. Regular plasma and serum samples were collected for ACTH, cortisol, glucose, insulin, and thyroid hormone analysis, in addition to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and oral sugar tests (OSTs). Significant treatment effects of IA TA were present at 48 h post-injection in both the TRH and the OST. There was also significant suppression by IA TA of baseline ACTH and cortisol between 2 h and 96 h post-treatment, hyperglycemia between 12 h and 48 h, and hyperinsulinemia at 32 h post-treatment. There were no treatment effects with respect to any measured thyroid hormones, nor were there any significant treatment effects of APS noted. Results suggest at least 2 days and up to 7 days should elapse between a single 9 mg IA TA treatment and OST and/or TRH testing. This study found that TA exhibits significant effects on ACTH, cortisol, glucose, and insulin, while the APS does not. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study explores the development of a fibre-rich breakfast cereal utilizing Indian Horse Chestnut Flour (IHCF) combined with traditional whole grains, including whole wheat flour, barley flour, and corn flour. The research focuses on optimising key extrusion process variables—feed moisture content (10–18%), barrel temperature (70–150 °C), screw speed (290–380 rpm), and IHCF concentration (1.75–4.75%) to enhance the cereal’s quality attributes. Comprehensive measurements and analyses were conducted to determine the optimal conditions, focusing on water absorption capacity, bulk density, sectional expansion, water solubility index, porosity, rehydration ratio, hardness, and overall product acceptability. Extrudates rich in IHCF were also evaluated for rheological and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Statistical analysis revealed significant impacts of these variables on the cereal’s physical properties. Under optimal conditions (12% feed moisture, 130 °C barrel temperature, 380 rpm screw speed, and 2.5% IHCF), the breakfast cereal exhibited superior expansion, porosity, and rehydration ratios, along with desirable hardness, achieving an overall acceptability score of 77.1. Further, an increase in feed moisture content corresponded with improved pasting properties in the optimized extruded flours. The rheological assessment indicated that the storage modulus (G′) of both extruded and native flours surpassed the loss modulus (G″), with samples at higher moisture content displaying the highest flow index but the lowest consistency coefficient. FTIR spectroscopy analysis underscored a reduction in peak intensity during extrusion, indicating notable structural modifications in the cereal constituents. This research presents significant advancements in the measurement and characterization of breakfast cereals, underscoring the potential of IHCF as a nutritious ingredient in the food industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: The characteristics of changes in the morphometric dimensions of the skin of horses belonging to the <Karabayir= breed at various physiological stages of postnatal ontogenesis were studied. It was found that the thickness of the skin of various anatomical points of the horse's body increases rapidly in the 2-3 age stages of postnatal ontogenesis, and in old horses, this indicator decreases, the thickness of the skin of the legs increases in the distal direction in connection with the morphofunctional properties, and the skin elasticity decreases. In connection with the effect of mechanical friction on the skin, it is noted that it is thin in the inner part of the thigh, and the thickest in the soft heel of the hoof, as well as somewhat thick in the lower part of the body of horses, and the thinnest in the ventral part of the head, neck, withers and abdomen. Also, it was found that the dermis of the skin in young horses, the subcutaneous layer (subcutis) thickens in middle-aged horses, and the dermis and subcutaneous layer thins and the skin elasticity decreases in old horses. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Background: Podcasts have become a popular digital forum for discussing scientific information with peers, as well as with the non-scientific community, often referred to as ‘edutainment’. It is unclear how science-based podcasts can support the veterinary industry through, for example, supporting good husbandry practices. Objectives: To understand the influence of ‘edutainment’ on equine owners' husbandry decisions. Study design: The sample population were listeners of the Conversations in Equine Science (CES) podcast recruited to complete an online survey via a link promoted by the CES hosts. The survey contained Likert-like questions assessing how listeners rated the importance of different forms of evidence when making husbandry decisions and questions relating to husbandry changes made. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used to analyse the data. The Likert package for R was used to explore importance ratings. Free text questions were analysed via a content analysis with a constructionist epistemological position. Results: The experience of veterinarians and scientific evidence were considered the most important forms of evidence that owners used when making decisions about their horse's management (93% agreed and 91% agreed they were important respectively). Additionally, 74% of respondents had made a change to the management or training principles prompted by an episode of CES, suggesting edutainment can be a prompt to management change. Of these, the majority (55%) had done so based on a joint discussion of the podcast and their own reading of the evidence. Main limitations: This was an opportunistic sample of those already invested in the edutainment format and may not represent those owners with no interest in scientific evidence. Conclusions: Podcasts are an easy-access, low-cost medium to convey research and current trends in the equine/equitation science genre. They may be a valuable tool for the veterinary industry to employ to support horse welfare. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Glanders, a highly contagious and often fatal disease affecting equids, is caused by Burkholderia mallei. Although sporadic cases of equine glanders have recently been documented in Mongolia, genome sequencing and molecular studies of the bacteria within this region are lacking. This study provided the first molecular characterization of B. mallei isolated from four native Mongolian horses from two different provinces in 2019 and 2022 by applying whole-genome sequencing with two SNP types (previously developed genotyping with 15 SNP markers that provide global coverage of the B. mallei population and the core genome coding SNP typing developed in this study). The Mongolian isolates were located within the L3B1 cluster, which was previously associated with the V-120 strain from Russia. Within the L3B1 cluster shared by neighboring countries, they were in a unique subbranch. In this study, specific SNP markers unique to the Mongolian strains were identified to track these strains using a high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA). This study revealed the unique phylogenetic background of Mongolian strains isolated from the eastern part of Mongolia. HRMA specific to the Mongolian subbranch may contribute to the molecular epidemiological monitoring of glanders in Mongolia and surrounding countries. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Desmitis of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT) is a commonly reported injury. Despite the commonality of this injury, the literature is limited to small case series, with the reported success following treatment varying from 18% to 75%. Objectives: To identify the prognosis and factors associated with a return to work following ALDDFT injury. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Medical records of horses from four equine hospitals (January 2000 and December 2018) with a diagnosis of desmitis of ALDDFT were reviewed. Data retrieved included case detail, use, history, lameness treatment and follow-up. Success was defined as returning to work. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify variables significantly associated with return to work. Results: Ninety-one horses were included. The mean age was 13.5 years (standard deviation 4.9 years). Thirty-four percent (28/91) of horses were sound at the initial presentation. Sixty-eight percent (62/91) of horses were managed using controlled exercise alone, 28% (29/91) were treated with intra-lesional injection, therapeutic ultrasound, extracorporeal shockwave therapy or desmectomy of the ALDDFT and 3% (3/91) were euthanased without treatment. Sixty-four percent (54/85) of horses returned to work. Horses that were lame at follow-up were less likely to return to work (odds ratio [OR] 107.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 20.06–580.61, p < 0.001) than those that returned to soundness. Identification of adhesions on ultrasonography was also associated with having reduced odds for return to work when compared to horses without adhesions (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01–0.76, p = 0.03). Main limitations: Retrospective nature of the study, the potential of selection bias with regards to follow-up. Conclusion: Sixty-four percent (54/85) of horses returned to work following injury of the ALDDFT. Persistence of lameness and adhesion formation were significantly associated with a poor outcome. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Single-confinement housing can pose welfare risks to domestic horses. This study investigated horses’ stress responses when confined to single stalls in different stable designs in a tropical savanna region to address a gap in the literature. In total, 23 horses were assigned to a stable with a central corridor and solid external walls (A) (N = 8), a stable with one side corridor and solid external walls (B) (N = 6), or a stable with a central corridor and no solid external walls (C) (N = 9). Air velocity, relative humidity, air temperature, and noxious gases were measured inside the stables, and the heart rate and HRV of the horses were also determined. The relative humidity was lower in stable C than in stable A (p < 0.05), while the air temperature was higher in stable C than in stable B (p < 0.05) during the day. The airflow and ammonia levels were higher in stable C than in stables B and A (p < 0.01–0.0001). Overall, horses’ HRV in stable A was lower than in those in stables B and C (p < 0.05–0.01). Horses in stable A tended to experience more stress than those in other stables. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Trachurus trecae, commonly called the Cunene horse mackerel, is a crucial fishery resource distributed along the eastern Atlantic coastline from Morocco to Angola. Angolan fishers frequently catch this species, which is highly valued. In 2010 and 2017, scientists collected T. trecae specimens from three regions of the Angolan coast (Cabinda: North – Luanda: Center – Benguela: South) to conduct genetic analysis using microsatellites specifically designed for this species. The objective was to evaluate the genetic diversity within and among regions within and among years. The results show that the mean allelic richness values in the 2010 and 2017 collections were 11.87 and 11.30, respectively. The LynchRd Point Estimator of Parentage (EPP) estimated 27%, 33%, 20% and 23% inbreeding for the Northern, the Center, the Southern, and for the temporal South 2017 samples, respectively. The effective population size (Ne) was estimated to be 343.2 in 2010 and 685.2 in 2017. No recent bottleneck effect was detected within either collection period. Analyses of multilocus genotype frequencies using both DAPC and STRUCTURE revealed that the 2010 samples contained three genetic clusters. The collection from the Center site was genetically less related to the North and South (RST=0.0265; DEST= 0.1695, p<0.05) than the latter were to one another. We found no significant genetic differentiation between the temporal sets of samples (ΦCT = 0.0076, p = 0.49), indicating temporal genetic stability of T. trecae on the Angolan Coast over seven years. Our results identified local stock structure, which informs management and conservation of the fishery. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) has been suggested as a marker of inflammation and oxidative stress in horses and could potentially be used for prognostication in horses with colitis. Objectives: Assessment of PON-1 in horses with colitis and comparison of two methods. Methods: Serum PON-1 was measured by two methods (paraoxon and p-nitrophenyl acetate) in 161 horses with colitis and 57 controls. Follow-up samples obtained during hospitalization were available from 106 horses with colitis. The two methods were compared. Results: Serum PON-1 was significantly lower in horses with colitis than in healthy horses (P <.0001 for both methods) as well as in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (P =.0141 [paraoxon-based method] and P <.0001 [p-nitrophenyl acetate-based method]), but with marked overlap between groups. PON-1 activity did not change parallel to a change in inflammatory status in response to treatment when assessed at admission and in up to seven follow-up samples. Admission PON-1 activity could not reliably classify horses as survivors or nonsurvivors, with sensitivity and specificity ranging between 53.1% and 72.9%. Results from the two methods were comparable. Conclusions: Both methods reliably measured serum PON-1 activity. Significant differences in PON-1 activity were found between healthy horses and horses with colitis and between survivors and nonsurvivors. However, PON-1 activity varied considerably within groups. Both the proposed reference intervals as well as alternative cutoff values resulted in suboptimal diagnostic and prognostic performance, and the use of serum PON-1 in horses with colitis thus seems to add little to existing diagnostic and prognostic markers. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Periods of limited activity during semester break may reduce performance during return to ridden work. This study evaluated fitness and muscling of horses when returning to work, following a 12-week period during which horses either continued (conditioned) or discontinued (non-conditioned) ridden work. It was hypothesized that non-conditioned horses would have a lower level of fitness, resulting in higher resting and peak heart rates and lower levels of muscling. Twelve mature, stock type horses aged 16 ± 5 years were assigned to either a conditioned group that maintained light-to-moderate riding or a non-conditioned group receiving no formal exercise. All horses had access to voluntary exercise for 12-24hr/d on grass pasture (1.5-2.5 hectares). Following the 12-week period, all horses were placed into a light-to-moderate intensity exercise program with resting heart rate, peak heart rate, body condition score, gaskin and forearm circumference, and topline muscle measurements performed on d 0, 14, and 28. Peak and resting heart rates were not different between groups (P > 0.05) but increased for both groups throughout the study (P = 0.04). Gaskin circumference of non-conditioned horses was larger (P = 0.04), although non-conditioned horses tended to be heavier (551.4 versus 491.4 ± 21.4 kg; P = 0.07). Conditioned horses had greater average topline muscling scores (P = 0.02). Horses that were conditioned over a 12-week break had greater muscling, but changes in fitness were not detected. Pasture access could contribute to maintenance of fitness during unridden periods. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Osteochondrosis (OC) is a developmental orthopaedic disease of significant concern in numerous sport horse breeds, with significant international relevance. Using digital radiographs, we assessed the occurrence of hock (tarsocrural joint) OC in 3 048 Pura Raza Española (PRE) horses which took part in a morpho-functional test, in three specific locations in the tarsus limbs: the Distal Intermediate Ridge of the Tibia (DIRT), the lateral trochlear ridges of the talus (LTT), and the medial trochlear ridges of the talus (MTT). An incidence rate of 13.3% was found for hock OC in the analysed sample, with the highest incidence rate observed in DIRT (10.0%) and the lowest in MTT (0.2%). Estimates of genetic predisposition to hock OC were carried out using three genetic approaches: 1a) a binomial threshold model based on the presence or absence of OC, 1b) a multinomial threshold model, on a scale from 0 (absence) to 3 (maximum), and 2) a linear model. The effects considered in the models included sex, genetic origin and stud class. All the analyses were based on the Bayesian inference methodology, using the THRGIBBS3F90 software. The binomial threshold model yielded the most suitable results, with an estimated heritability for Overall hock OC of 0.71 ± 0.055 on the underlying scale (0.53 on the observed scale), ranging in different locations from 0.48 ± 0.087 (LTT) to 0.66 ± 0.063 (DIRT) on the underlying scale (0.10 and 0.38 on the observed scale, respectively). The highest significative genetic correlation was observed between Overall and DIRT (0.97) for approach 1a, and the lowest significant genetic correlation was between Overall and LTT (0.49), for approach 2. This study contributes valuable insights into the genetic predisposition towards, as well as for the potential for selective breeding against, hock OC in PRE horses, and provides a basis for future research and breeding programmes aimed at minimising the occurrence of hock OC and promoting the overall health of this breed. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Medication adherence is an essential aspect of healthcare for patients and is important for achieving medical objectives. However, the lack of standard techniques for measuring adherence is a global concern, making it challenging to accurately monitor and measure patient medication regimens. The use of sensor technology for medication adherence monitoring has received much attention lately since it makes it possible to continuously observe patients’ medication adherence behavior. Sensor devices or smart wearables utilize state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods to analyze intricate data patterns and provide predictions accurately. The key aim of this work is to develop a sensor-based hand gesture recognition model to predict medication activities. In this research, a smart sensor device-based hand gesture prediction model is developed to recognize medication intake activities. The device includes a tri-axial gyroscope, geometric, and accelerometer sensors to sense and gather data from hand gestures. A smartphone application gathers hand gesture data from the sensor device, which is then stored in the cloud database in a.csv format. These data are collected, processed, and classified to recognize the medication intake activity using the proposed novel neural network model called Sea Horse Optimization–Deep Neural Network (SHO-DNN). The SHO technique is implemented to update the biases and weights and the number of hidden layers in the DNN model. By updating these parameters, the DNN model is improved in classifying the samples of hand gestures to identify the medication activities. The research model demonstrates impressive performance, with an accuracy of 98.59%, sensitivity of 97.82%, precision of 98.69%, and an F1 score of 98.48%. Hence, the proposed model outperformed the most available models in all the aforementioned aspects. The results indicate that this model is a promising approach for medication adherence monitoring in healthcare applications, instilling confidence in its effectiveness. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: This study describes the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including antinociceptive effects, of a transdermal buprenorphine solution in horses. It was hypothesized that transdermal application would lead to sustained blood concentrations and antinociceptive effects with fewer adverse effects compared with intravenous (IV) injection. Study design: Prospective nonrandomized four-part parallel experimental study. Animals: A group of eight horses (three mares and five geldings) aged 6–12 years. Methods: Horses were administered incremental doses of 15, 30 and 45 μg kg–1 of buprenorphine transdermal solution and a single IV dose of 5 μg kg–1 of buprenorphine with a 2 week washout period between treatments. Concentrations of buprenorphine were determined in plasma using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and modeled using a nonlinear mixed effects population pharmacokinetic model to determine pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacodynamic effects, including changes in locomotor activity, heart rate, body temperature, gastrointestinal borborygmi, thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds were recorded. Mixed effects analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons were performed using a Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment to assess differences in pharmacodynamic parameters between baseline and each time point within each dose group and between dose groups at the same time point. Results: Transdermal application of buprenorphine resulted in low systemic concentrations relative to IV injection. Bioavailability after transdermal application was 11%. Thermal nociceptive thresholds were significantly (p < 0.05) increased (4.3–10.7% relative to baseline) for up to 72 hours in the IV dose group, but only sporadically in the transdermal dose groups (2.5–9.9% relative to baseline). Changes in locomotor activity, heart rate and borborygmi varied over time and with dose. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Limited thermal antinociceptive effects were observed at the transdermal doses studied likely owing to limited absorption relative to IV dosing. Future studies may be directed toward investigating antinociceptive effects of higher transdermal doses and different application sites. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: This case series describes three cases of osseous cyst-like lesions of the proximal phalanx (P1), which were associated with a complete fracture. The fractures and osseous cyst-like lesions were analysed through radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) images for fracture configuration and prodromal factors, such as subchondral sclerosis and periosteal new bone formation. Internal stabilisation was performed in all cases through placing transcortical bone screws under CT guidance. In conclusion, the presence of osseous cyst-like lesions in the proximal P1 as well as the addition of prodromal markers, such as localised periosteal new bone formation and subchondral bone sclerosis, suggest pathological subchondral bone with the potential to fracture and stabilisation should be prioritised. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An 18-year-old mare, admitted for colic, underwent an exploratory laparotomy for right dorsal colon displacement. During recovery from anaesthesia, a severe acute onset laryngeal obstruction occurred at standing, requiring orotracheal re-intubation, which relieved the obstruction. This was followed by secondary pulmonary oedema, treated with furosemide (2 mg/kg intravenously) and oxygen. At re-extubation, attempted 30 minutes later, the horse re-obstructed immediately and collapsed, prompting an emergency tracheostomy. Furosemide (2 mg/kg intravenously) and dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg intravenously) were also administered. The horse stood up thereafter with a patent airway. In the history, to note, nasogastric intubation was particularly difficult at admission, and was identified as a potential cause of laryngeal trauma that may have precipitated laryngeal obstruction due to severe local inflammation. Dynamic laryngeal collapse probably also played a role due to high inspiratory negative pressure generated at the precise timing of standing, similar to exercise. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The objective of the present study was to analyze the genetic diversity, individual-based assessment of population structure, and admixture in the Dülmen wild horse population in comparison to warmblood, coldblood, and primitive horse populations. The Dülmen wild horse is kept as a unique horse population in the Merfelder Bruch near Dülmen in Westphalia, Germany, and since 1856 has been managed by the Dukes of Croÿ. The Dülmen wild horse population is exposed to the natural conditions of the Merfelder Bruch all year round without human interventions for feeding and veterinary care. In the present study, genetic diversity was estimated for 101 Dülmen wild horses using multilocus genotypic information from a set of 29 autosomal microsatellites and compared with 587 horses from 17 different horse populations. Dülmen wild horses maintained a high degree of genetic diversity, with an average observed heterozygosity of 0.68, a mean number of 6.17 alleles, and heterozygote deficit of −0.035. Pairwise genetic distances (FST, Nei’s standard, and Cavalli-Sforza distances) were closest to German coldblood breeds, Polish Konik, and Icelandic horses and most divergent from Sorraia and Przewalski’s horses. Neighbor joining dendrogram and PCA plots showed a clear distinction of Dülmen wild horses from other populations, particularly from Przewalski horses. Posterior Bayesian analysis confirmed clear differentiation from other horse populations without an admixture pattern and a high membership index (0.92). It was possible to distinguish Dülmen wild horses from Dülmen and Polish Konik horses. In conclusion, Dülmen wild horses show a notable separation from other German horse breeds and primitive horse populations and may serve as a resource to study evolution of equine domestication. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Analysing social behaviour provides valuable insights into the dynamics of species living in groups. An essential part of social behaviour is represented by lead-and-follow interactions as they influence group stability through individual needs and decision making. In horses, Equus ferus caballus, this behaviour plays a crucial role since individuals depend on the security and knowledge their group offers. Only one study has analysed the lead-and-follow behaviour of Przewalski's horses, Equus ferus przewalskii. However, no such study has been conducted on the wild population, nor on the potential impact of the horses' origin and experience. We filmed 34 wild-born and captive-bred individuals with different experiences (held in a fenced enclosure before release into the wild, long-term reintroduced and wild-born) in the Great Gobi B (Mongolia) over summer 2018, late spring 2019 and autumn 2019 to investigate Przewalski's horses' lead-and-follow behaviour in situ. We documented lead-and-follow interactions within 11 groups and used these data to construct lead-and-follow networks. We also examined the influence of various social factors (origin, sex, age, dominance rank, group size, parity, kinship and time belonging to the group) on different network measures. The analyses revealed that wild-born horses with greater experience in the area tended to exhibit well-defined lead-and-follow connections with few leading individuals, typical of stable groups of horses. In contrast, in inexperienced reintroduced groups, many (or all) members controlled the movement. The results show that newly formed groups of released Przewalski's horses require time to develop typical and stable lead-and-follow patterns. © 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Two studies were conducted to evaluate the use of medical ozone (O3) in commercial extenders for equine semen cryopreservation. In the first study (Study 1), 0, 5, and 15 µg/mL of O3 were added to diluents of refrigerated or frozen semen. Samples were evaluated for sperm kinematics at different time points for the chilled samples and after a thermoresistence test for the frozen/thawed samples. In the second study (Study 2), 0, 5, and 10 µg/mL of O3 were added to an antibiotic-free diluent for refrigerated semen for comparison with the control group in which semen was diluted in the same diluent enriched with antibiotics. Semen sample kinematics were analyzed and an aliquot was collected after ozonification for bacteriological analyses. For Study 1 no difference was found comparing all the kinematic parameters analyzed over time, in the various treatments (P > 0.05). In Study 2 the absence of antibiotics did not affect the kinematic parameters compared to the control (P > 0.05). However when antibiotics were added, a smaller number of bacterial colony-forming units were detected compared to samples without antibiotics and without or with different O3 supplementations. In conclusion, O3 treatment at low dosages did not affect the semen kinematics, although it was ineffective in preventing bacterial overgrowth. Higher O3 concentrations should be evaluated to explore the possibility of reducing the use of antibiotics in equine sperm conservation. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Improved characterization of arrhythmias is based on minimally invasive catheterizations. However, these catheterizations have been poorly explored in horses because apart from 3-dimensional (3D) mapping systems, continuous guidance of the catheter's position with adequate detail is difficult using current imaging modalities. Hypothesis: Position multiple electrophysiology catheters simultaneously at predetermined strategical positions in the heart using transthoracic echocardiographic guidance. Animals: Eight adult healthy horses. Methods: Observational study. Two electrophysiological studies were performed: 1 procedure with catheters positioned in the right heart in the standing sedated horse and 1 procedure under general anesthesia with catheters positioned in the left heart. Except for the coronary sinus catheter, each catheter positioning was simultaneously guided by right-parasternal transthoracic echocardiography and 3D electro-anatomical mapping. Results: For each catheter position, a central imaging plane was taken as the starting point, after which the imaging probe was shifted, rotated, and angulated to visualize the catheter over its entire length, including its distal electrode. Catheter positionings in the right heart and left ventricle were successfully guided in the majority of the horses whereas catheter positionings in the left atrium, and especially the pulmonary veins, were challenging to guide echocardiographically. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Ultrasound guidance of catheters to specific positions useful for electrophysiological mapping was feasible in the right heart and left ventricle but challenging for the left atrium. This approach creates a perspective for minimally invasive arrhythmia diagnosis without the need for a 3D mapping system. Left parasternal views and intracardiac echocardiography might provide better guidance for left atrial positions. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Horses can become obese and develop related health issues such as laminitis from excessive grazing on high-quality pasture grass; limiting pasture intake can allow weight loss to occur. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of space-restricted rotational grazing on body weight (BW) and time budgets in horses. Eight mature geldings and mares with maintenance-only requirements were randomly assigned to either a space-restricted rotational grazing group (SRG; BW 512 ± 6 kg; n = 4) or a continuous grazing group (CG; BW 517 ± 49 kg; n = 4) for 42 d SRG horses grazed an area with dimensions to provide 80–90 % of mean digestible energy requirement for the 4 horses over a 7-d grazing period; whereas, the CG horses continuously grazed similar non-toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue pasture providing greater than maintenance requirements for the 42 d Horses in the SRG group were moved to a new area every 7 d for 6 weeks. On d 7 at 1600 h of each week, horses were brought inside, and feed was withheld overnight. At 0700 h the next day, BWs were recorded prior to turnout. Observers recorded behaviors simultaneously on SRG and CG horses every six minutes throughout the day three days per week according to an ethogram. This included 30 s scans of all horses. Proportion of grazing and standing had an inverse relationship. Proportion of grazing was affected by the treatment by time interaction, which grazing was displayed more in SRG than CG during weeks 2 and 3, and then reversed weeks 4, 5 and 6. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The prevalence and impact of Getah virus (GETV) are significant concerns in China. GETV can infect a wide range of animals, including horses, pigs, sheep, cattle, birds, and humans, resulting in substantial losses in the livestock and agricultural industries. GETV infection can cause the development of ulcers and inflammation in the mouth and gums of horses, which result in pain and discomfort and lead to symptoms such as reduced appetite, drooling, and difficulty chewing. As a result, there is a pressing need for efficient and rapid disease diagnosis methods. However, the currently available diagnostic methods have limitations in terms of operational time, equipment, and the experience of the individuals using them. In this study, a rapid, specific, and sensitive detection method was developed using a colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for the detection of antibodies against GETV in horses. To prepare the ICS, the antigen domain of the E2 glycoprotein of GETV was expressed using the Escherichia coli expression system after analysis with DNAstar v7.1 software. The nitrocellulose membrane was coated with rE2 protein or SPA to form the test line and control line, respectively. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the strip were verified. The results showed that the test strip had a detection limit of up to 1:320 dilutions for GETV-positive serum, with no cross-reactivity observed with other equine-susceptible pathogens such as equine arteritis virus (EAV), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-I), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), equine influenza virus (EIV), African horse sickness virus (AHSV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Furthermore, the ICS exhibited a concordance rate of 94.0% when testing 182 clinical serum samples compared to the virus neutralization test. Overall, this ICS diagnosis method will be an effective tool for the rapid detection of GETV in the field. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The presented study determined the effects of shallot cultivars and levels of horse manure vermicompost on its growth and production traits. The developed shallot cultivars came from true seeds. The research materialized from June to October 2022 at the Agricultural Technology Research and Development Institute (IP2TP) in Kelara District, Jeneponto Regency, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. This study employed a factorial design with two factors and three replications. The first factor included four doses of vermicompost: 0, 5, 10, and 15 t ha-1. The second factor consisted of three shallot cultivars (Lokananta, Maserati, and Sanren-F1). The results revealed that the shallot cultivar Sanren-F1 recorded the highest average plant height, bulb weight, diameter, and yield. The horse manure vermicompost treatment with the 15 t ha-1 dose also emerged with the maximum average plant height, number of leaves, bulb weight, and bulb diameter over other applications. However, the horse manure vermicompost (10 t ha-1) gave the foremost bulb yield. © Society for the Advancement of Breeding Research in Asia and Oceania (SABRAO) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The present study describes the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of a case of diffuse seminoma in a 16-year-old male mixed-breed horse. According to the owner, the animal's left testicle had been gradually increasing in size over a period of 2 months. On palpation, the testicle had a firm consistency, with no sensitivity to digital pressure, was adhered to the scrotum and measuring 16 cm × 8 cm. In the ultrasound examination, it presented a heterogeneous texture and areas of hypoechogenic echogenicity without visualization of the mediastinum. Therefore, the bilateral orchiectomy was performed. After the surgical procedure, it was found that the affected testicle presented a firm mass measuring 9 cm × 7 cm × 3.5 cm. Histologically, a multilobulated, non-encapsulated and invasive tumour mass was found, which replaced the seminiferous tubules, consisting of polygonal cells arranged in a mantle that varied from cohesive to loosely cohesive, supported by a scarce fibrous stroma. In the immunohistochemical examination, the neoplastic cells showed positive immunolabelling for OCT4 and C-KIT. In this report, the physical examination combined with the ultrasonographic examination were fundamental to the therapeutic management of the case, and the final diagnosis was made after histopathological and immunohistochemical tests. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Perineural anesthesia of the tibial nerve can be performed ultrasound-guided or blindly, with the latter still being commonly used in equine practice due to practical constraints, despite its lower accuracy and hence, common failure to achieve desensitization. This may be associated with anatomical variations or inadequate landmarks for injection. To examine the course of the tibial nerve, document potential anatomical variations, and determine optimal landmarks for perineural injection, dissection was conducted along the medial aspect of the tibia in 10 paired cadaver hindlimbs. No anatomical variations of the tibial nerve were observed. Mean tibial nerve thickness was 6 ± 1 mm. The junction with the plantar nerves was located at a maximum of 85 mm and the junction with the medial cutaneous branch was at a maximum of 150 mm proximal to the proximal aspect of the calcaneal tubercle. The mean distance of the tibial nerve to the cranial border of the superficial digital flexor was 11 ± 6 mm. In conclusion, problems with perineural anesthesia of the tibial nerve cannot simply be attributed to anatomical variations. The thickness of the nerve and the amount of perineural tissue may present specific challenges for achieving adequate desensitization. Our results support the generally recommended site for tibial nerve perineural injection at 100 mm proximal to the calcaneal tubercle and 11 mm cranial to the superficial digital flexor. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Determination of horse breeds predisposed to congenital and juvenile cataracts will enable investigations into potential genetic mechanisms for cataracts in horses. Objective: To investigate horse breed predispositions to congenital and juvenile cataracts in two academic referral populations. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Medical record identification of horses diagnosed with congenital or juvenile cataracts at the Cornell University Equine Hospital (2000–2022) and the University of California-Davis (UCD) Large Animal Clinic (1990–2021). Signalment, examination findings and treatments were recorded. Descriptive statistics were performed, and breed over-representations were determined using Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Results: Thirty-one (Cornell) and 70 (UCD) horses with congenital or juvenile cataracts were identified, for a total of 101 affected horses. Seventy-eight horses were affected bilaterally and 23 were affected unilaterally, for a total of 179 affected eyes. Standardbreds were significantly over-represented at both institutions, comprising 32.5% of congenital/juvenile cataract cases and 10% of the equine hospital population at Cornell (p < 0.001) and 4.3% of cataract cases and 1.3% of the equine hospital population at UCD (p = 0.03). Thoroughbreds were under-represented for congenital and juvenile cataracts at both institutions (p = 0.03 Cornell, p = 0.01 UCD). Main limitations: Retrospective study, potential for selection bias. Conclusions: The over-representation of the Standardbred breed for congenital and juvenile cataracts at two institutions suggests an underlying genetic basis in the breed. Future genetic and genomic studies are warranted to investigate heritable cataracts in Standardbred horses. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic zoonoses and represents a significant health risk for humans, especially for immunodeficient patients. The main transmission route is by oral uptake of oocysts and consumption of undercooked meat of infected animals. Different species have been evaluated as possible reservoirs of the parasite, but few studies have been carried out to examine the role of horses in transmission of the disease. Given the proximity of these animals to humans and the widespread consumption of their meat in many countries, including the Mediterranean basin, it is important to determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection in this species. In this study, blood samples from 105 horses were collected and the presence of T. gondii was evaluated by serological and molecular methods. Antibodies against T. gondii of 12 horses (11.43%) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), whereas 29 horses (27.62%) showed positive for PCR. Seroprevalence was related to use of the animals, being higher in horses used for dressage than in others. Purebreds had higher seroprevalence than crossbred animals. No differences between breed, sex or age were found. The results of this study confirm the presence of T. gondii infection in horses, highlighting the need to analyse the meat of this species before human consumption and to control of this infection in horses, as they could be an important reservoir of this zoonotic parasite. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The anatomical variations of the maxillary septum and the septal bullae can generate challenges during the interpretation of radiographs of the horses’ heads and make it difficult to accurately identify the sites affected in sinus disorders. The description of the radiographic appearance of these structures is currently scarce in the scientific literature. This work aims to describe the anatomical and radiographic characteristics of the maxillary septum and maxillary septal bullae in horses. Six chemically preserved equine cadaver heads were used which, after being submitted to the maxillary osseous flap, the maxillary septum and its respective bullae were identified. Radiographic examinations before and after contrast impregnation on these structures were performed. The positioning of the maxillary septum varied between the anatomical specimens and between the sides of the same specimen. The 30° oblique dorsoventral lateral and lateral projections allowed the identification of the maxillary septum and septal bullae. However, the bullae remained superimposed on the dental arches in the dorsoventral projections with the mandible in a neutral position or with the mandible displaced. The oblique offset radiographic positioning was suggested and proved effective for the examination of the maxillary septal bullae, where the mandible was displaced to the side of the bullae to be examined, and the radiographic beam inclined in the same direction. The maxillary septum and its bullae could be properly identified in a macroscopic way after the osseous flap and the contrasted radiographic examination allowed its adequate interpretation. Variations in size and position are considered normal for the equine species. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

ABSTRACT: Background: Palmar/plantar osteochondral disease (POD) of the metacarpal/tarsal condyles is a common pathological finding in racehorses. Objective: To compare diagnoses, imaging details, and measurements of POD lesions between cone-beam computed tomography CT (CBCT), fan-beam CT (FBCT), and low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using macroscopic pathology as a gold standard. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Thirty-five cadaver limbs from 10 horses underwent CBCT, FBCT, MRI, and macroscopic examination. CT and MR images were examined for presence of POD, imaging details of POD, and measurements of POD dimensions and areas. Imaging diagnoses, details, and measurements were compared with macroscopic examination and between modalities. Results: Forty-eight POD lesions were seen over 70 condyles. Compared with macroscopic examination the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis were 95.8% (CI95 = 88%–99%) and 63.6% (CI95 = 43%–81%) for FBCT, 85.4% (CI95 = 74%–94%) and 81.8% (CI95 = 63%–94%) for CBCT, and 69.0% (CI95 = 54%–82%) and 71.4% (CI95 = 46%–90%) for MRI. Inter-modality agreement on diagnosis was moderate between CBCT and FBCT (κ = 0.56, p < 0.001). POD was identified on CT as hypoattenuating lesions with surrounding hyperattenuation and on MRI as either T1W, T2*W, T2W, and STIR hyperintense lesions or T1W and T2*W heterogeneous hypointense lesions with surrounding hypointensity. Agreement on imaging details between CBCT and FBCT was substantial for subchondral irregularity (κ = 0.61, p < 0.001). Macroscopic POD width strongly correlated with MRI (r = 0.81, p < 0.001) and CBCT (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) and moderately correlated with FBCT (r = 0.69, p < 0.001). Macroscopic POD width was greater than all imaging modality (p < 0.001). Main limitations: Effect of motion artefact in live horse imaging could not be assessed. Conclusions: All imaging modalities were able to detect POD lesions, but underestimated lesion size. The CT systems were more sensitive, but the differing patterns of signal intensity may suggest that MRI can detect changes associated with POD pathological status or severity. The image features observed by CBCT and FBCT were similar. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the oral supplementation of astaxanthin (ATX) on inflammatory markers in 3-year-old Arabian racehorses. Despite the recognized antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of ATX observed in vitro in rodent models and in human athletes, the effects in equine subjects remain unknown. This study involved a controlled trial with 14 horses receiving either ATX (six horses) or a placebo (eight horses), monitored over four months of race training. Inflammatory cytokines: TNFα, IFNγ, IL-6, IL-10, and prostaglandin E (PGE), were measured monthly to assess the impact of ATX on the inflammatory response. The results indicated no significant differences in measured parameters between the ATX and the control group during the study. However, a significant time-dependent decrease in TNFα and IFNγ levels (p = 0.001) was observed in both groups, suggesting that regular training naturally modulates inflammatory responses. Moreover, positive correlations were noted between TNFα and IFNγ (p < 0.001) in the early phase of the study and between IL-6 and IL-10 (p = 0.008) in the later phase. Hematological parameters remained stable and within reference ranges, indicating no adverse effects of ATX supplementation. Performance metrics, including the number of races completed and wins, showed no significant differences between groups, suggesting that ATX did not enhance athletic performance under the study conditions. Overall, while ATX supplementation affected neither cytokine levels nor performance in Arabian racehorses, the natural anti-inflammatory effects of regular training were evident. Further research is needed to explore potential benefits of ATX supplementation under different conditions, such as in horses with subclinical inflammation or varying training regimens, to fully clarify its role and applications in equine sports medicine. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Hoof care providers are pivotal for implementing biomechanical optimizations of the musculoskeletal system in the horse. Regular visits allow for the collection of longitudinal, quantitative information (“normal ranges”). Changes in movement symmetry, e.g., after shoeing, are indicative of alterations in weight-bearing and push-off force production. Ten Warmblood show jumping horses (7–13 years; 7 geldings, 3 mares) underwent forelimb re-shoeing with rolled rocker shoes, one limb at a time (“limb-by-limb”). Movement symmetry was measured with inertial sensors attached to the head, withers, and pelvis during straight-line trot and lunging. Normalized differences pre/post re-shoeing were compared to published test–retest repeatability values. Mixed-model analysis with random factors horse and limb within horse and fixed factors surface and exercise direction evaluated movement symmetry changes (p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction). Withers movement indicated increased forelimb push-off with the re-shod limb on the inside of the circle and reduced weight-bearing with the re-shod limb and the ipsilateral hind limb on hard ground compared to soft ground. Movement symmetry measurements indicate that a rolled rocker shoe allows for increased push-off on soft ground in trot in a circle. Similar studies should study different types of shoes for improved practically relevant knowledge about shoeing mechanics, working towards evidence-based preventative shoeing. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: SR9009, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) agonist, is known for its potential benefits in energy homeostasis. It failed to receive the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval and its illegal distribution has raised concerns. As a result, it has been classified as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA). This study emphasizes the application of the in-silico molecular networking technology to analyze phase I drug metabolites in horses, distinguishing it from conventional methodologies in forensic science. Feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) analysis identified 15 metabolites, with novel major N-dealkylated metabolite (-C8H7NO4S), indicative of diverse metabolic modifications in horse liver microsomes incubation assay. Additionally, a proposed metabolic pathway of SR9009 in the in vitro assay was outlined, including the previously known dehydroxylated metabolite. Finally, the metabolic pathways included in this study were as follows: hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, N-dealkylation dihydroxylation, and combinations. Molecular networking provided insights into MS spectra connectivity, facilitating rapid interpretation and accurate detection of previously undiscovered metabolites. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of SR9009 metabolism in horses and underscores the importance of advanced analytical techniques, such as molecular networking, in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of metabolite analysis for forensic and doping control purposes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Parasympathetic tone activity (PTA) in response to nociceptive stimulus in conscious non-sedated horses is unknown. Objectives: Study PTA, heart rate (HR), and horse grimace scale (HGS) at rest and during mechanical nociceptive stimulation. Animals: Ninety healthy young adult horses (females, males): 30 each of Friesians, Quarter Horses, and Warmbloods. Methods: Prospective control study. The study consisted of habituation to equipment (Day 1), baseline recordings (Days 2 and 3), and nociceptive testing applying mild pressure to the metacarpus (Day 4). Parasympathetic tone, HR, and HGS were recorded simultaneously on Days 2 to 4. Each study lasted 30 minutes and was done in triplicate at 3 different time points per day. Results: Baseline PTA was not different among breeds. It decreased in Warmbloods and Quarter Horses during placement of the stimulus device without stimulation (P <.01). A significant decrease in PTA (P <.001) occurred during nociceptive stimulus (marked in Quarter Horses, intermediate in Warmbloods, and mild in Friesians). Heart rate and HGS increased significantly (P <.001) during the stimulus in all breeds but returned to baseline poststimulation. Friesians required higher pressure (P <.05) to elicit an aversive response to the stimulus. Conclusions: Horses' PTA, HR, and HGS change in response to a mild mechanical nociceptive stimulus with Friesians showing less variation. Stress induced a decrease in PTA in Quarter Horses and Warmbloods but not in Friesians. Friesians appeared to be more tolerant to pain based on PTA, HR, and HGS findings compared with other breeds. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Available descriptive studies on equine pneumonia are outdated or focus on specific horse or bacterial populations. Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation and bacterial isolates of adult horses with bacterial pneumonia and identify factors associated with death. Animals: One hundred sixteen horses >2 years old with bacterial pneumonia. Methods: Retrospective case series. Data regarding history, physical examination, clinicopathologic features, treatment, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and outcome were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: Historical risk factors were present for 60% of cases, whereas abnormal vital signs on intake were present for <50%. Most horses (58%) underwent at least 1 change of antimicrobial treatment, and 67% received the highest-priority critically important antimicrobials. Streptococcus zooepidemicus was the most isolated bacteria (44%), followed by Escherichia coli (19%), Klebsiella spp. (18%), other Streptococcus species (17%), and Bacillus spp. (13%). Fusobacterium spp. were the most common anaerobic isolates (11%). Antimicrobial susceptibility varied widely. Survival to discharge was 73%. Heart rate at presentation (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.008-1.17, P =.03) and higher creatinine (OR 14.1, 95% CI 1.56-127.6, P =.02) increased the risk of death. Higher lymphocyte count (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.94, P =.04) reduced risk. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Contrasting older literature, Fusobacterium spp. were the most common anaerobes. Streptococcus zooepidemicus remained the most common isolate and was predictably susceptible to penicillin. Antimicrobial susceptibility was otherwise variable and broad applicability is limited as this was a single-center study. Increased risk of death associated with tachycardia and abnormally high serum creatinine concentration is consistent with previous studies. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Horse strangles is an acute infectious disease that manifests itself sporadically, enzootically, and epizootically and is widespread in Kazakhstan, where it mainly affects foals and young horses. The causative agent of strangles is the bacterium Streptococcus equi. In conditions of global antibiotic resistance, bacteriophages can become an effective means of treating horse stranglers. The research aim is to develop a new phage therapy against horse strangles using a local test strain of Streptococcus equi, namely bio-material isolated from a foal with strangles. When working with bacteriophages, the following methods were used: the Appelman (serial dilutions) and Grazia (agar layers) methods were used the isolation of bacteriophages and nutrient media GRM agar and GRM broth were used for the cultivation of bacteria and their phages. As a result, 6 bacteriophages were isolated from the studied 117 samples from the collected samples, after studying their basic biological properties, it was decided in further work to select the 1 most active bacteriophage specific to Streptococcus equi. This 1 bacteriophage was sequenced and registered in the Streptococcus phage BV0002 GenBank "Bank It2666451 Bacteriophagum OQ319049" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/OQ319049). Genome-wide sequencing was performed on an automatic genome-wide sequencer Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, using the Ion XpressPlus Fragment Library Kit (Waltham, MA, USA). As a result, taking into account the highest percentage of identity of the analysed sequence in the international database using the BLAST algorithm, as well as the results of phylogenetic analysis, it was found that the selected bacteriophage belongs to the family Myoviridae, characteristic of the species Bacteriophagum Streptococcus equi. © 2024, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Due to the paucity of information on circus management effects on the welfare of horses, this study investigated the plasma concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin, known to be indices of mental status, as well as the reactive oxygen metabolites (d-Roms) and the biological antioxidant potential (BAP), likely to denote the oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium of organisms, in horses managed in different Italian circuses. For the study, 56 circus horses of different breeds and ages were enrolled and divided into six groups according to the horses’ management (circus management, groups G1–G5; classic riding management representing the control group, CG). From each horse, blood samples were collected in order to assess the concentration of selected parameters. One-way ANOVA showed no differences (p > 0.05) in serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, d-Roms and BAP values between circus and control horses. No differences related to the breed of the horses enrolled in the study were found in the values of all investigated parameters (p > 0.05). Furthermore, neurotransmitters showed overlapping levels between the different age classes of investigated horses (p > 0.05); contrariwise, the age of the horse displayed a significant effect on BAP values, with the oldest horses (16–21 age class) exhibiting lower BAP values compared to 4–5, 6–10 and 11–15 age classes (p < 0.05), whereas the d-Roms showed similar values in horses of different age classes (p > 0.05). The results gathered in the present study suggest that the mental status of horses under circus management was not compromised; however, better attention and care in the management of older horses is advocated, as they showed a lower biological antioxidant potential than younger horses; thus, they could be more susceptible to oxidative stress. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine rhinitis A (ERAV) and B (ERBV) viruses are respiratory pathogens with worldwide distribution. The current study aimed to determine the frequency of infection of ERAV and ERBV among horses and foals at Polish national studs, and to determine genetic variability within the viruses obtained. Virus-specific quantitative RT-PCR assays targeting a 5′ untranslated region were used to screen nasal swabs collected from 621 horses at 16 national horse studs from throughout Poland, including 553 healthy horses and 68 horses with respiratory disease. A partial DNA polymerase gene was amplified and sequenced from the qRT-PCR-positive samples. The obtained sequences were analysed using phylogeny and genetic network analysis. None of the nasal swabs were positive for ERAV, whereas ERBV was found in 11/621 (1.78%) samples collected from 10 healthy horses and one foal affected by respiratory disease. Partial DNA polymerase gene sequence variability was correlated with individual horses and studs from which samples were collected when only Polish sequences were analysed, but there was no correlation between country of origin and ERBV sequence when Polish and international sequences were included in the network. The report presents the first detection of ERBV in Poland. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Existing data on the equine hay market and buying preferences in Pennsylvania (PA) is outdated and more recent data is needed. The objective of this project was to characterize the practices and attitudes of PA horse hay buyers. An online survey was created and distributed. It received 435 total responses (of these, 346 were complete responses) from PA horse hay buyers from October 2021 to February 2022. Data presented (descriptive statistics) represents the percentage of respondents answering that question. Most (76%) respondents were in the recreational sector of the horse industry and the majority (62%) purchased hay for 2-5 horses. Small square bales (2-string) were most commonly purchased (93%), and most respondents bought their hay exclusively by the bale (75%). The most common reasons for not purchasing large bales were not being able to transport or handle them (70%), followed by not having adequate storage (60%). Horse owners were most likely to buy hay directly from local farmers (90%) than any other source. The top three most important factors when purchasing hay were absence of mold, absence of weeds, and smell (rated “very important” by 98, 53, and 52% of respondents, respectively). Most respondents did not use hay feeders in stalls or outside (38 and 50%, respectively). Most hay buyers (63%) never have their hay analyzed for nutrient content. The data collected from this survey can help hay producers understand buying practices of horse owners and help equine nutritionists identify areas of need for horse owner education about hay. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Three Caspian miniature horses, exhibiting facial swellings, were examined in Alborz province. Physical examinations denoted sialolithiasis in two patients, and arose suspicion of the same condition in the third patient. The sialoliths were removed using a transcutaneous surgical approach with standing sedation using xylazine (1 mg/kg, intravenously) and local anaesthesia with lidocaine (5–10 mL) in all three patients. In Case 1, multiple pieces of stone were excised from the left parotid duct using a transcutaneous approach. In Case 2, a single oval-shaped stone (44 g) was excised from the right parotid duct with the same technique as mentioned above. Case 3 presented a 1-g amorphous stone partially obstructing the right parotid duct, resulting in cyst formation on the right aspect of the face. Chemical analysis identified calcium carbonate as the primary component. Given the distribution of horses in Iran, accurate estimation of the frequency of sialolithiasis is quite challenging, and numerous cases are overlooked. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Recently, treatment of equine atrial tachycardia by three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping (3D EAM) and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has been described. Myocardial sleeves in the caudal vena cava and pulmonary veins are a potential trigger for initiation and perpetuation of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation in the horse. Isolation of these myocardial sleeves by RFCA may be an effective treatment for these arrhythmias. Objectives: To describe the feasibility of 3D EAM and RFCA to isolate caudal vena cava and pulmonary veins in adult horses using 3D mapping and a contact force (CF)-guided ablation system. Study design: In vivo experiments. Methods: 3D EAM and RFCA was performed in five horses without cardiovascular disease under general anaesthesia, using the CF-guided system CARTO®3. Point-by-point RFCA aimed for isolation of caudal vena cava and pulmonary veins. Radiofrequency energy was delivered in power-controlled mode with a target power of 45 W, CF between 10 and 15 g and 30 mL/min irrigation rate, until an ablation-index of 450–500 was reached. Results: In the right atrium, myocardial sleeves of the caudal vena cava were isolated (n = 5). In the left atrium, isolation of ostium II (n = 3), ostium III (n = 1) and ostium I, II and III en bloc (n = 1) was performed. Successful isolation was confirmed by entrance and exit block. Main limitations: Horses were euthanised at the end of the procedure, so long term effects such as potential reconnection of isolated veins could not be studied. Conclusions: This is the first description of 3D EAM and RFCA with CARTO®3 in horses, thereby showing the technical feasibility and successful caudal vena cava and pulmonary vein isolation. CF measurement allowed monitoring of catheter-tissue contact, resulting in efficient acute lesion creation as confirmed by entrance and exit block. This is a promising treatment for cardiac arrhythmias in horses. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Organic amendment and green manuring are two agricultural practices highly recommended to improve sustainability in agriculture since they show numerous beneficial effects on both soils and crops. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of both, specifically organic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW) compost and horse bean (Vicia faba L., cv minor) green manure, combined separately or together with a mineral fertilization using synthetic products and in comparison with a mineral fertilization alone (control), on a top-quality tobacco crop (dark fire-cured Kentucky) grown in the cultivation district of Central Italy (High Tiber Valley, Tuscany region) in 2020 and 2021. The following parameters were measured: (i) leaf emergence rate (LER, leaves day−1); (ii) crop growth rate (CGR, kg dry biomass ha−1 day−1); (iii) root weight density (RWD, mg cm−3); (iv) yield of cured product (CLY, Mg ha−1). Analytical determinations were carried out on soil, sampled at the 0–0.3 m depth (organic matter, %; total N, %; NO3-N, mg kg−1; C/N; P and K, mg kg−1), and on plant biomass (total N, %; NO3-N, kg ha−1). Soil water retention measures were also made. Water productivity (WP, kg cured product m−3 gross crop evapotranspiration, ETc gross), irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg cured product m−3 seasonal irrigation volume) and N agronomic efficiency (NAE, kg cured product kg−1 mineral N applied by synthetic fertilizers) were calculated. Both the applications of OFMSW compost and horse bean green manure increased soil content of organic matter and main nutrients (N, P and K), as well as C/N, when compared with control conditions. There was an increase in soil water content in C conditions over the entire soil matric potential interval (0.04 to 1.2 MPa) with a maximum value at 1.2 MPa in both years. Both practices appeared promising for tobacco cultivation and could help to better address the nitrogen needs of the crop during the season and reduce potential water pollution due to nitrates. Considering the amount of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer saved by using both organic soil amendment and green manuring, there should be fewer potential carbon emissions due to the production, transportation and field application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: An international description of the diagnostic approaches used in different institutions to diagnose acute equine diarrhoea and the pathogens detected is lacking. Objectives: To describe the diagnostic approach, aetiological agents, outcome, and development of laminitis for diarrhoeic horses worldwide. Study design: Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods: Information from horses with acute diarrhoea presenting to participating institutions between 2016 and 2020, including diagnostic approaches, pathogens detected and their associations with outcomes, were compared between institutions or geographic regions. Results: One thousand four hundred and thirty-eight horses from 26 participating institutions from 4 continents were included. Overall, aetiological testing was limited (44% for Salmonella spp., 42% for Neorickettsia risticii [only North America], 40% for Clostridiodes difficile, and 29% for ECoV); however, 13% (81/633) of horses tested positive for Salmonella, 13% (35/262) for N. risticii, 9% (37/422) for ECoV, and 5% (27/578) for C. difficile. C. difficile positive cases had greater odds of non-survival than horses negative for C. difficile (OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.23–5.91). In addition, horses that were positive for N. risticii had greater odds of developing laminitis than negative horses (OR: 2.76, 95%CI: 1.12–6.81; p = 0.029). Main limitations: Due to the study's retrospective nature, there are missing data. Conclusions: This study highlighted limited diagnostic investigations in cases of acute equine diarrhoea. Detection rates of pathogens are similar to previous reports. Non-survival and development of laminitis are related to certain detected pathogens. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine reasons for horses to have neck radiographs performed, the incidence of transposition of the ventral lamina of C6 onto C7 (TC67), and the final diagnoses for all horses. Our hypotheses were to find a similar incidence of TC67, as has been previously reported, and an increased incidence of neck pain and dysfunction in horses with TC67. ANIMALS 135 horses. METHODS Retrospective observational study. Medical records of 135 horses with cervical vertebral column radiographs between 2020 and 2022 were assessed. Patient signalment, reasons for radiographs, radiographic findings, and diagnoses were analyzed. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used for normality determination. Nonparametric tests were used to analyze data. RESULTS 20% of horses were diagnosed with TC67. Significantly more horses with TC67 were warmblood horses (63%); TC67 was found in 28% of warmblood horses. There was no significant difference in signalment or whether horses were in work between the groups, although significantly more horses with TC67 performed in English disciplines (71%). No differences in reasons for examination or final diagnoses of neurologic disease, cervical orthopedic disease, or lameness were present between groups. In horses with neck pain, TC67 was significantly more common (31%) than in horses without (18%). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our results indicated that TC67 occurs more in warmblood horses. In the small group of horses with neck pain reported, TC67 was more commonly seen than in those without. Given the complexity of this region and the paucity of studies exploring neck pain and neck biomechanics, we suggest the need for standardized prospective studies. ©The authors.

ABSTRACT: This study was conducted to evaluate morphometric traits of horse ecotypes reared in four districts of the Bale highlands, southeastern Ethiopia. Twenty-seven morphometric traits were measured from 500 horses (294 males and 206 females) of both sexes. Data were analyzed using SAS 2012. This study revealed that certain traits, such as head length, loin length, bi-ischial width, and sternum height of horses were similar. However, significant differences (p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0.05) were observed in other traits across the districts. All traits were affected by age (p < 0.05) except rump width and canon perimeter. All 27 morphometric traits were subjected to STEPDISC analysis, of which 21 had the best discriminating power. The uppermost distances of 32.2 and, 28.8 were reported between the Agarfa and Dinsho and, Agarfa and Sinana horse populations, respectively. Mean separation distance among districts ranges from -1.75 to 3.57, -2.42 to 2.43, and -1.61 to 0.92 for CAN1, CAN2 and CAN3, respectively. The quadratic discriminate function classified 95.2, 94.4, 96.0, and 96.8 % of the sampled horses into source populations of the Dinsho, Agarfa, Sinana, and Goba districts, respectively. In addition, the cross-validation summary revealed reduced consistency of membership among each districts with 5 % average success rates and 4, 8, 4, and 4 % for the Dinsho, Agarfa, Sinana, and Goba districts, respectively. Therefore, the presence of variation in morphometric traits within the Bale Highland horse ecotypes has the potential for selection and further genetic interventions. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Gene doping, which includes the non-therapeutic use of genes or genetic elements that have the capacity to enhance athletic performance, is prohibited in horseracing and equestrian sports. To provide a comprehensive assessment of matrix and detection techniques, a custom adeno-associated virus serotype 8 vector was designed to include PCR binding sites for multiple target genes and assay types. The vector was injected via an intramuscular route into two Thoroughbred horses and matrices collected at defined timepoints. DNA was analysed using 3 detection methods: qPCR, digital PCR, and NGS. Overall, there was a strong correlation across the different detection methods employed, although digital PCR was less sensitive at lower concentrations. High concentrations of vector were detected at early timepoints in plasma and whole blood, which rapidly dropped after 0.5 d to trace levels by 4 d and 9 d post-administration respectively, following a similar pattern to previous studies. Vector was detected in dried blood spots at lower levels than whole blood, but with a similar detection time. Detection in hair root bulbs in one horse was observed at over a month post-administration, which opens new avenues for future gene doping testing in humans and animals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.

ABSTRACT: Detection of doping with steroids that are also endogenous in the horse can be challenging, and a variety of approaches to distinguish exogenous administration from their natural presence are employed. Knowledge of endogenous concentrations of various steroids in different genders of horses (intact male, castrated male and female) and factors that could naturally affect them is beneficial for establishing ways for detection of their use. The current internationally adopted approaches include concentration-based thresholds in urine and plasma, steroid ratios in urine and targeting the administered intact steroid esters in plasma and hair. However, these have their limitations, and therefore, other strategies, such as additional biomarkers and steroid profiling based on longitudinal testing and multivariate analysis, have been investigated and could potentially improve detection of the use of endogenous steroids in horses. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the steroids (androgens, oestrogens and progestogens) that have been reported to be endogenous to horses in literature, their concentration ranges in different genders and factors potentially affecting them as well as current and possible future approaches to detect their use. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To study the changes in dynamic compliance (Cdyn), ventilation/perfusion (V˙/ Q˙) mismatch and haemodynamic variables in hypoxaemic anaesthetized horses whose PaO2 increased following salbutamol inhalation. Study design: Retrospective, clinical, cohort study. Animals: A group of 73 client-owned horses treated with salbutamol when PaO2 <100 mmHg (13.3 kPa) during anaesthesia. Methods: Horses were divided into two groups: responders (R), where PaO2 after salbutamol ≥1.2 PaO2 before treatment (i.e. ≥20% increase), and non-responders (NR), where PaO2 after salbutamol <1.2 PaO2 before treatment. Demographic data and intraoperative variables before treatment were compared between R and NR. Cdyn, arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference [P(a-E´)CO2], estimated ratio of dead space to tidal volume (est.VD/VT), estimated shunt fraction (F-shunt), heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic arterial pressure and dobutamine requirements were compared before and after treatment within R and NR. For each variable, the difference (Δ) between values pre- and posttreatment was calculated and compared between groups R and NR. Numerical data were compared using univariate or bivariate analysis and categorical data were compared using chi-square test; p < 0.05. Results: Of the 73 horses 50 were classified as R while 23 horses were classified as NR. There was no statistical difference between R and NR for demographic data or initial intraoperative variables except for body weight [R: 531 (170–715) kg, NR: 540 (420–914) kg]. While salbutamol did not alter Cdyn in either group, it significantly decreased P(a-E´)CO2, est.VD/VT and F-shunt in R only. ΔP(a-E´)CO2, Δest.VD/VT and ΔF-shunt were significantly greater in R (−17.8%, −19.0% and −24.1%, respectively) than in NR (11.5%, 6.6% and −0.3%, respectively). Conclusions and clinical relevance: In hypoxaemic anaesthetized horses responding to inhaled salbutamol by a ≥1.2 increase in PaO2 no change in Cdyn was detected, but indicators of V˙/ Q˙ mismatch improved. © 2024 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: Background: Reliable ECGs are crucial for diagnosing arrhythmias, yet a lack of standardization impedes arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment in horses. Objectives: To objectively determine an optimal position of Einthoven's triangle for ECG recordings in horses at rest, which can form the basis for standardized ECG recording and improve diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias. Animals: The study involved 72 healthy, warmblood horses aged between 3 and 20 years. Methods: In view of future 12-lead studies and vectorcardiography, requiring an orthogonal system, Einthoven's triangle was positioned around the heart, in the transverse plane. Therefore, 11 electrodes were placed encircling the thorax behind the olecranon, to construct triangles with a horizontal base. Electrocardiogram recordings from different triangles were analyzed. Signal processing involved filtering, R peak detection, and median complex generation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Euclidean distance measures were employed for data analysis. Results: The left mid-thoracic and ventral regions had high PCA scores, indicating high information content. Base-down triangles exhibited higher summed Euclidean distances, contributing to enhanced diagnostic capabilities. A base-down triangle, called “Delta (Δ) configuration” emerged as most informative, while meeting all criteria. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The base-down “Delta configuration” is the optimal Einthoven's triangle adapted for horses, providing large amplitudes and potential to provide basic insights into the mechanisms and origins of cardiac arrhythmias. Because the Delta configuration is positioned in the transverse plane, it forms the ideal basis for 12-lead ECG recordings that provide vectorcardiograms in an orthogonal coordinate system. Standardizing electrode positioning could improve ECG data comparability in equine cardiology. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The aim of this article is to show the most significant factors influencing the indoor environment in winter considering the operating conditions of an older stable modified for housing 12 horses and an indoor riding arena for teaching and sports purposes. This research focused on assessing the influences affecting the internal environment from the point of view of the construction of the building and ventilation control in the operating conditions of working and non-working days. The analysis of the results showed that the massive masonry structure has sufficient thermal insulation and accumulation, which was manifested by good temperature stability inside the stable of 7.2 ± 1.7 °C when the outside air temperature was −4.80 ± 1.5 °C. At low outdoor air temperatures of −6.44 ± 0.4 °C, the following conditions were found: a higher relative air humidity (76.0 ± 5.3%), a high CO2 concentration 2317.1 ± 931.7 ppm, and a high airborne dust concentration PM10 = 231.94 ± 19.13 μg·m−3 and PM2.5 = 160.13 ± 6.28 μg·m−3. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the solution and function of the stable ventilation. The small size of the windows and their uneven distribution (average daylight factor ei from 0.313 ± 0.154 to 0.835 ± 0.309) caused insufficient daylight in some individual boxes. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A 17-y-old Arabian mare was presented to the Auburn Large Animal Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a long-term history of intermittent mild recurrent colic that responded to medical treatment. CBC revealed mild lymphopenia; serum biochemistry findings were of increased gamma-glutamyl transferase and creatine kinase activities, hyperferremia, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia. Abdominocentesis was compatible with low-protein transudate. Due to the progression and duration of clinical signs, the owner elected euthanasia. Postmortem examination and histopathology confirmed a cholangiocarcinoma. The neoplastic cells were arranged in large cysts containing lakes of mucin that comprised 90% of the tumor volume; thus, a mucinous variant was determined. The neoplastic cells had strong cytoplasmic immunolabeling for cytokeratin 19 and lacked immunolabeling for hepatocyte paraffin 1, supporting bile duct origin. Cholangiocarcinomas are infrequent tumors in horses with nonspecific and slow progressive clinical signs, including recurrent colic. Mucinous cholangiocarcinomas are seldom reported in veterinary medicine and, to our knowledge, have not been reported previously in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With the increasing energy demand and the increase in carbon emissions from using fossil fuels, the demand for using renewable energy is increasing daily. Therefore, research on hydrogen storage, the biggest problem in using hydrogen energy, is significant. In this concept, a surface area of 2270 m2/g obtained with activated carbons obtained from the pyrolysis of horse chestnut shell with ZnCl2 at 600 °C, and the micropore volume of the same sample found to be 0.93 cc/g. Hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperature found to be 4.46% by weight. At room temperature, increased H2 storage was observed with increasing pressure and found to be 0.44% at 30 bar. According to thermogravimetric results, the residue amounts of activated carbons at 900 °C which synthesized at different agent ratios and carbonization temperatures varied between 76% and 83.3% respectively. Elemental analysis showed that the C% increase was linear with the increased surface area of the activated carbons obtained. According to infrared spectrum, the cellulosic structure of the samples pyrolyzed at 800 °C was wholly destroyed according to the results obtained; the micropore volume and surface area of the adsorbent are significant in hydrogen storage. Moreover, activated carbons are more environmentally friendly and essential in hydrogen storage than other adsorbents. © 2024

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine whether student involvement in intravenous catheter (IVC) placement increases the risk for complications and to report the rate and types of complications associated with IVCs in adult horses in a university teaching hospital. ANIMALS 455 IVCs placed in 394 horses. METHODS Data relevant to IVC placement and removal were retrieved from an electronic medical record search including records of adult horses from January 1 to December 31, 2022. Data retrieved from records included the role of the individual who prepared the site and placed the IVC, site of IVC placement, and type of IVC. The reason for removal of the IVC and presence or absence of detectable changes within the vein at the time of removal were documented in addition to clinical data, allowing for classification of each case. Data were reviewed retrospectively, and statistical analyses were performed using mixed-effects logistic regression models. Significance was set at P ≤ .05. RESULTS The overall rate of complications was 15.6%, and the most common type of complication was swelling of the vein. Students were involved in 87 of 455 IVC site preparations and placements, and there were no statistically significant differences in complication rates between IVC sites prepared or placed by veterinary students versus nonstudent personnel. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Veterinary personnel and clients may be hesitant to allow student involvement in IVC placement in horses, but these data suggest that student involvement does not increase the risk of IVC complications. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of metoclopramide administered via intravenous continuous rate infusion (IV CRI) and subcutaneous (SC) bolus and evaluate for gastrointestinal motility and adverse side effects. Study design: Experimental study; randomized, crossover design. Animals: Six healthy adult horses. Methods: Each horse received metoclopramide via IV CRI (0.04 mg/kg/h for 24 h) and SC bolus (0.08 mg/kg once), with ≥1 week washout period between. Plasma was analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. Compartmental modeling was used to determine PK parameters for each treatment; nonparametric superposition was used to simulate multiple SC bolus regimens. Gastrointestinal motility and evidence of adverse effects were monitored. Results: Tmax (h) for SC bolus was 0.583 ± 0.204 versus 17.3 ± 6.41 for IV CRI, while Cmax (ng/mL) was 27.7 ± 6.38 versus 43.6 ± 9.97, respectively. AUC (h × ng/mL) was calculated as 902 ± 189 for 24 h IV CRI versus 244 ± 37.4 simulated for 0.08 mg/kg SC bolus every 8 h. Simulations revealed similar exposure between groups with administration of 0.96 mg/kg/day SC bolus, divided into three, four, or six doses. SC bolus bioavailability was estimated as 110 ± 11.5%. No clear trends in motility alteration were identified. No adverse effects were noted. Conclusion: Repeated SC boluses of metoclopramide at 0.08 mg/kg would result in lower total drug exposure and Tmax than IV CRI administration but would be highly bioavailable. Clinical significance: Higher and/or more frequent SC bolus doses are needed to achieve a similar AUC to IV CRI. No adverse effects were noted; however, evaluation of alternative dosing strategies is warranted. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To identify the size and distribution of the horse population in the Northern Rivers Region of NSW, including changes from 2007 to 2021, to better understand populations at risk of Hendra virus transmission. Methods: Census data from the 2007 Equine Influenza (EI) outbreak were compared with data collected annually by New South Wales Local Land Services (LLS) (2011–2021), and with field observations via road line transects (2021). Results: The horse populations reported to LLS in 2011 (3000 horses; 0.77 horses/km2) was 145% larger than that reported during the EI outbreak in 2007 (1225 horses; 0.32 horses/km2). This was inconsistent with the 6% increase in horses recorded from 2011 to 2020 within the longitudinal LLS dataset. Linear modelling suggested the true horse population of this region in 2007 was at least double that reported at the time. Distance sampling in 2021 estimated the region's population at 10,185 horses (3.89 per km2; 95% CI = 4854–21,372). Field sampling and modelling identified higher horse densities in rural cropland, with the percentage of conservation land, modified grazing, and rural residential land identified as the best predictors of horse densities. Conclusions: Data from the 2007 EI outbreak no longer correlates to the current horse population in size or distribution and was likely not a true representation at the time. Current LLS data also likely underestimates horse populations. Ongoing efforts to further quantify and map horse populations in Australia are important for estimating and managing the risk of equine zoonoses. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is one of the key mediators of inflammation during innate immune responses. Mature bioactive IL-1β mediates essential host defense mechanisms but also has a mechanistic role in several autoinflammatory and degenerative diseases. In horses, specific and sensitive assays for IL-1β are crucial for immunological research on inflammatory processes and diseases. In this article, we describe the development of four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against equine IL-1β. The specificity of the new IL-1β mAbs was confirmed using a panel of equine recombinant cytokines and chemokines. The mAbs were validated for detection of native mature IL-1β in a fluorescent bead-based assay and for staining of IL-1β-producing immune cells by flow cytometry. The bead-based assay for equine IL-1β had a linear quantification range between 60 pg/ml to 960 ng/ml. Horse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) secreted IL-1β after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in time and dose dependent manner as quantified by the new equine IL-1β bead-based assay. A comparison of two commercial equine IL-1β ELISA kits with the new IL-1β fluorescent bead-based assay revealed that the bead-based assay improved the quantification of native equine IL-1β in LPS stimulated PBMC supernatants by detecting it with high intensity and a broad linear quantification range, while both ELISAs resulted in low signals and poor native IL-1β recognition. Intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis confirmed that the main cellular source of IL-1β in equine PBMC after LPS stimulation were CD14+ monocytes. IL-1β secretion from PBMC was inhibited by a caspase inhibitor but protein translation within the cells was not, supporting the accumulation of pro-IL-1β within the cells even when proteolytic cleavage for IL-1β activation is missing. This confirmed the importance of specific mAbs for analyzing the biologically active, mature IL-1β in horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a global worldwide infection, which can lead to the death of animals. Despite the causative agents of EP being well studied, there are no data on the distribution and genetic characteristics of EP agents in any region of Russia. In this study, blood samples from 750 horses from Novosibirsk province, Irkutsk province, and Altai region of Russian Siberia were examined for the presence of EP agents. Theileria equi and Babesia caballi were detected in all examined regions, with mean prevalence rates of 60.4% and 7.2%, respectively. The identified pathogens were genetically characterized by the 18S rRNA gene. The determined T. equi sequences were highly conserved and belonged to genotypes A and E, with genotype E being found in 88.6% of genotyped samples. In contrast to T. equi, B. caballi sequences were genetically diverse. Seven sequence variants of B. caballi were identified, and only two of them matched known sequences from the GenBank database. The determined B. caballi sequences belonged to four distinct branches within genotype A. Mixed infections with several variants of B. caballi or with T. equi and B. caballi were common. The conducted phylogenetic analysis based on all available B. caballi sequences of the 18S rRNA gene (> 900 bp) from GenBank and from this study first demonstrated the presence of five monophyletic clusters within genotype A and three clusters within genotype B. Thus, the genetic study of B. caballi from Siberia has significantly expanded the data on the genetic diversity of this pathogen. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the outcome of tenoscopically guided palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) desmotomy to treat PAL constriction without concurrent intrathecal soft-tissue injury, notably of the digital flexor tendons and manica flexoria. Study design: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. Animals: Sixty-five horses. Methods: Horses from four UK equine hospitals, with digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) tenosynovitis, which underwent tenoscopically guided PAL desmotomy for treatment of PAL constriction between 2017 and 2022 were included. All horses had lameness isolated to the DFTS/PAL, and PAL constriction was diagnosed tenoscopically when there was difficulty maneuvering the endoscope into or through the fetlock canal. Horses with tearing of the digital flexor tendons and/or manica flexoria, or any other intrathecal pathology, were excluded. Follow up was via structured telephone questionnaire. Results: Follow up (median 25 months) was available for 61 horses with cobs and ponies predominating. Forty-two returned to their previous level of work, or a higher level, postoperatively and 50 owners were satisfied with the outcome of surgery. Eleven horses returned to lower level exercise, and six were retired/euthanized as they did not regain soundness. Fifty-two horses achieved soundness (median 3 months postoperatively). Conclusion: Tenoscopically guided PAL desmotomy for the treatment of PAL constriction in the absence of intrathecal soft tissue injury had a good prognosis for return to previous levels of exercise in a UK horse population. Clinical significance: The prognosis for horses undergoing tenoscopically guided PAL desmotomy to treat PAL constriction in the absence of intrathecal injury is better than previously described. Cobs and ponies seem to be predisposed to PAL constriction in agreement with the previous literature. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Phenylbutazone (PBZ) is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for horses. However, because of its gastrointestinal side effects, its administration requires careful attention in veterinary practice. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a serum biomarker associated with increased damage to the equine gastrointestinal system. This study investigated the hematological effects and alterations in the gastrointestinal tract and assessed serum MDA concentrations following repeated oral PBZ administration at clinical doses. Fourteen horses were randomly divided into control and treatment groups. All horses in the treatment group were administered 4.4 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of PBZ syrup orally twice a day for 7 days, whereas the control group received syrup as a placebo. The development of gastrointestinal side effects was investigated using gastroscopy, abdominal ultrasound, and fecal pH; serum MDA concentrations were assessed using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Data were compared between PBZ-treated and control horses before and after the treatment period. The treatment group exhibited decreased albumin and total protein concentrations. Moreover, this group exhibited a higher thickness of the right dorsal colon wall (p = 0.03) and had higher scores for squamous gastric ulcers (p = 0.01). Fecal pH was lower in the treatment group than in the control group after PBZ administration (p < 0.01). Although MDA concentrations were higher in the treatment group after PBZ administration, they did not differ significantly from those of the control group. This study highlighted the changes in hematological and gastrointestinal lesions resulting from PBZ administration in horses at clinical doses, even without clinical signs. However, MDA may not be an optimal biomarker for the early detection of gastrointestinal damage due to PBZ treatment in horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Equine physiotherapy commonly includes basic exercises such as walking backward (BW) and voluntary lifting of single limbs (SLL), but trunk movements during these have not been studied. In order to compare the trunk kinematics during BW and SLL with forward walking (FW), nine horses were measured in FW, BW and during SLL triggered by tactile cue. Kinematics were obtained from skin markers captured by ten high-speed video cameras. Trunk angles were calculated in sagittal and horizontal planes from withers, dorsal to spinous processes of the 16th thoracic vertebra (T16), 2nd and 4th sacral vertebrae (S2, S4), WT16S2 and T16S2S4 respectively. From the hooves, maximum hoof height during swing phase and horizontal distance between hoof and median body plane during swing and stance phases were determined. Dorsoventral range of motion (ROM) and maximum flexion of WT16S2 was significantly larger in BW than in FW, while laterolateral ROM was significantly smaller during hindlimb swing phase in BW and SLL than in FW. In contrast, dorsoventral ROM of T16S2S4 was significantly smaller during stance and swing phases of hindlimbs in BW compared to FW, and throughout the movement. During forelimb swing phase, T16S2S4 ROM was significantly larger in BW than SLL. Hindhoof height in SLL was significantly higher than in FW. Distance between median body plane and hooves was significantly larger in BW than in FW, and significantly larger in BW than in SLL for hindlimb swing phase. In BW, increased lumbosacral stabilisation and the larger area of support created by fore- and hindlimbs may represent a strategy to enhance body stabilisation, as BW entails some insecurity. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Increased radiopharmaceutical uptake (IRU) in skeletal muscle in horses has been previously reported but only a few authors describe its location in detail. Objectives: To describe and document the distribution of IRU in skeletal muscle in a population of flat racing and endurance horses. Study design: Retrospective descriptive study. Methods: Bone phase nuclear skeletal scintigraphy studies of 17 endurance and 9 racehorses with IRU in skeletal muscle were reviewed. The affected muscles were described and differences between endurance and flat racing horses were analysed. Ultrasonographic appearance of the muscles with IRU was also described when available. Results: A total of 22 hindlimb scans (14 endurance horses, 8 racehorses) and 7 forelimbs scans (5 endurance horses, 2 racehorses) were analysed. In the hindlimbs, IRU was most frequently observed in the semitendinosus muscle in endurance horses (7/14, 50%) and in the gluteus medius muscle in racehorses (4/8, 50%). Bilateral IRU in the same muscle was often observed (11/22, 50%) in the hindlimbs. In 87.5% of the studies with IRU in the biceps femoris (7/8) or the semitendinosus muscles (7/8), the IRU was bilateral. In the forelimbs, IRU was most frequently observed in the triceps brachii (2/5, 40%) and latissimus dorsi (2/5, 40%) muscles in endurance horses and in the brachiocephalicus muscle in racehorses (2/2, 100%). The distribution of the skeletal muscles with IRU was more varied in endurance than in flat racehorses. No statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of the skeletal muscles with IRU between endurance and racehorses. Conclusions: Even though no statistical differences between groups could be demonstrated, this study describes the frequent location of IRU in muscle in the semitendinosus of endurance horses and in the gluteus medius of flat racehorses included in this study. The distribution of muscles with IRU was more variable in endurance horses. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Additional immunomodulatory treatment is needed for the management of immune-mediated disease in horses. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunomodulatory agent used in human and veterinary medicine for the prevention of graft rejection and the management of autoimmune diseases. Few studies exist investigating the pharmacokinetics of MMF in horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of MMF in healthy horses in the fed vs. fasted state. Six healthy Standardbred mares were administered MMF 10 mg/kg by a nasogastric (NG) tube in a fed and fasted state. A six-day washout period was performed between the two doses. No statistically significant differences in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations were seen at any time point apart from 8 h, when plasma metabolite concentrations were significantly higher in the fasted state compared to the fed state (p =.038). Evidence of enterohepatic recirculation was seen only in the fasted state; this did not yield clinical differences in horses administered a single-dose administration but may be significant in horses receiving long-term MMF treatment. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Chromosomal abnormalities occur in the equine population at a rate of approximately 2%. The use of molecular cytogenetic techniques allows a more accurate identification of chromosomal abnormalities, especially those with a low rate of abnormal metaphases, demonstrating that the actual incidence in equine populations is higher. Objectives: Estimation of the number of carriers of karyotypic abnormalities in a sample from a population of young horses of various breeds, using molecular cytogenetic techniques. Study design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Venous blood samples were collected from 500 young horses representing 5 breeds (Purebred Arabian, Hucul, Polish primitive horse [Konik], Małopolska, Coldblood, Silesian). Chromosomes and DNA were obtained from blood lymphocytes and evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and PCR, using probes and markers for the sex chromosomes and select autosomes. Results: Nineteen horses, 18 mares and 1 stallion, were diagnosed with different chromosomal abnormalities: 17 cases of mosaic forms of sex chromosome aneuploidies with a very low incidence (0.6%–4.7%), one case of a SRY-negative 64,XY sex reversal mare, and one mare with X-autosome translocation. The percentage of sex chromosomal aberrations was established as 3.8% in the whole population, 6.08% in females and 0.49% in males. Main limitations: Limited sample size, confined to horses from Poland. Conclusions: The rate of sex chromosomal abnormalities we identified was almost double that reported in previous population studies that used classical chromosome staining techniques. FISH allowed the detection of aneuploid cell lines which had a very low incidence. The FISH technique is a faster and more precise method for karyotype examination; however, it is usually focused on only one or two chromosomes while banding karyotyping includes the entire chromosome set. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology results from 1 lung might not be representative of both lungs. Objectives: To determine whether the lung site sampled would influence the horse's BAL cytology profile, and if a pooled BAL sample would be superior with regard to BAL cytology diagnosis in a cohort of healthy and subclinical asthmatic warmblood horses. Animals: Fifty-nine horses in 2021 and 70 horses in 2022, the follow-up included 53 of the same in each year. Methods: A cross-sectional study with follow-up included BAL cytology samples from individual lungs and from pooled BAL samples. The BAL samples were enumerated and differential cell count were applied to categorize the horses as control or with airway inflammation (AI). Results: Bronchoalveolar lavage mast cell count was higher in left lung compared to right lung (2021; median 1.6 [range, 0.6-3.3] vs 1.2 [0.7-1.5] P =.009, 2022; median 3.1 [2.1-4.2] vs 2.4 [1.7-3.4], P <.001) and compared to pooled samples (2022; median 2.6 [1.7-3.7], P <.001). Between year 2021 and 2022, 17 of the horses had changes in BAL cytology from control to AI or vice versa. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Pooled BAL sample was the least reliable for detecting AI, and was not representative of the overall lung condition. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of FLow-controlled EXpiration (FLEX) ventilation expiration time and speed on respiratory and pulmonary mechanics in anesthetized horses in dorsal recumbency. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult research horses. METHODS In this randomized crossover experimental study, horses were anesthetized 3 times and were ventilated each time for 60 minutes using conventional volume-controlled ventilation (VCV), linear emptying of the lung over 50% of the expiratory time (FLEX50), or linear emptying of the lung over 100% of the expiratory time (FLEX100) in a randomized order. The primary outcome variables were dynamic compliance (Cdyn), hysteresis, and alveolar dead space. The data was analyzed using two-factor ANOVA. Significance was set to P <.05. RESULTS Horses ventilated using FLEX50 and FLEX100 showed significantly higher Cdyn and significantly lower hysteresis values compared to horses ventilated using VCV. Horses ventilated using FLEX50 had significantly lower alveolar dead space compared to horses ventilated using FLEX100 or VCV. Horses ventilated using FLEX100 had significantly lower alveolar dead space compared to VCV horses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our results demonstrate improved Cdyn, hysteresis, and alveolar dead space in horses ventilated with either FLEX50 or FLEX100 relative to traditional VCV. The use of FLEX with a faster exhalation speed (FLEX50) offers additional respiratory advantages. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: This study assessed for the first time the bioremediation potential of an organic horse amendment in soils contaminated with solid wastes of the obsolete pesticide lindane (α−hexachlorocyclohexane (α−HCH) = 80 mg kg−1, β−HCH = 40 mg kg−1, γ,δ,ε−HCH≈10 mg kg−1) searching for a self-sufficient bio-based economy. Four treatments were implemented: polluted (PS, ΣHCHs = 130 mg kg−1) and control (CS, ΣHCHs = 1.24 mg kg−1) soils and the respective amended soils (APS and ACS). A commercial amendment, coming from organic wastes, was used for soil biostimulation (5% dry weight), and the temporal evolution of the enzymatic activity (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase activity, phenoloxidase, arylamidase, phosphatase, and urease) and HCHs concentration of the soils was evaluated over 55 days under controlled humidity and temperature conditions. The horse amendment positively influenced the physicochemical properties of the soil by reducing pH (from 8.3 to 8) and increasing the organic matter (TOC from 0.5 to 3.3%) and nutrient content (P and NH4+ from 24.1 to 13.7 to 142.1 and 41.2 mg kg−1, respectively). Consequently, there was a notable enhancement in the soil biological activity, specifically in the enzymatic activity of dehydrogenase, phenol-oxidase, phosphatase, and urease and, therefore, in HCH degradation, which increased from <1 to 75% after the incubation period. According to the chlorine position on the cyclohexane ring, the following ranking has been found for HCHs degradation: β-HCH (46%) < ε-HCH (57%) < α-HCH (91%) ≈ δ-HCH (91%) < γ-HCH (100%). Pentachlorocyclohexene (PCCH) and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) were identified as HCHs degradation metabolites and disappeared at the end of the incubation time. Although further research is required, these preliminary findings suggest that organic amendments represent a sustainable, harmless, and cost-effective biostimulation approach for remediating soils contaminated with recalcitrant HCHs, boosting the circular economy. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Thirty non-lame Quarter Horses under athletic exercise training, aged between 2 and 23 years old, both males and females were evaluated in order to find ultrasonographic characteristics of distal interphalangeal joint’s (DIPJ) collateral ligaments (CLs) in their forelimbs. The horses were divided into three groups based on age. Group A consisted of horses aged between three and four years old; group B consisted of equines aged between five and ten years old; and group C consisted of animals that were over ten years old. Six parameters were assessed, including increase of the ligament area (LA), hypoechogenicity (HO), collapse of coronal vessels (CV), heterogeneity (HT), hyperechogenicity (HR) and irregularity of ligament borders (IB). Older horses were more prone to displaying ultrasonographic alterations in the CL-DIPJ. The prevalent ultrasonographic findings observed were alterations in the echogenicity of the fibers and ligament thickening, diagnosed in 73,33% (88/120) of the examined ligaments. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) displayed more frequent alterations than the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). In conclusion, this study provided a detailed characterization of the ultrasound examination of the CL-DIPJ in the forelimbs of clinically non-lame Quarter Horses subjected to intensive exercise routines. The findings demonstrate that even in non-lame horses, ultrasonographic alterations can be observed in the CL-DIPJ. © 2024 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido.

ABSTRACT: Horses are excellent bioindicators for the assessment of environmental pollution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels and potential bioaccumulation of 28 mineral elements in 75 horse whole blood samples collected from five pollution-prone areas of Sicily, Italy. A direct mercury analyzer (DMA-80) was used for Hg determination, and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for all other elements. A one-way ANOVA test, followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison for post hoc comparison, was applied to assess statistically significant differences between mineral elements and the five experimental groups. The levels of mineral elements in hay and concentrate were below the limits set by Regulation No. 744/2012. The mineral content of whole blood samples was slightly influenced by the region of origin of the horse. p values < 0.05 were statistically meaningful. However, the concentrations of mineral elements in horses’ whole blood remained within reference ranges. In conclusion, the present study shows that the mineral content does not represent a toxicological risk for the analyzed horses. In addition, the study areas did not appear to show a high mineral element contamination. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equid alphaherpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) is a highly contagious respiratory tract pathogen of horses, and infection may be followed by myeloencephalopathy or abortion. Surveillance and early detection have focused on PCR assays using less tolerated nasal swabs. Here, we assess non-invasive non-contact sampling techniques as surveillance tools in naturally equid gammaherpesvirus 2-shedding horses as surrogates for EHV-1. Methods: Horses were individually housed for 10 h periods on 2 consecutive days. Sampling included nasal swabs, nostril wipes, environmental swabs, droplet-catching devices, and air sampling. The latter was completed via two strategies: a combined air sample collected while going from horse to horse and a collective air sample collected at a stationary central point for 6 h. Samples were screened through quantitative PCR and digital PCR. Results: Nine horses on day 1 and 11 horses on day 2 were positive for EHV-1; overall, 90.9% of the nostril wipes, 81.8% of the environmental surfaces, and 90.9% of the droplet-catching devices were found to be positive. Quantitative analysis showed that the mean DNA copies detection per cm2 of nostril wipe sampled concentration (4.3 × 105 per day) was significantly (p < 0.05) comparable to that of nasal swabs (3.6 × 105 per day) followed by environmental swabs (4.3 × 105 per day) and droplet catchers (3.5 × 103 per day), respectively. Overall, 100% of the air samples collected were positive on both qPCR and dPCR. In individual air samples, a mean concentration of 1.0 × 104 copies of DNA were detected in per m3 air sampled per day, while in the collective air samples, the mean concentration was 1.1 × 103. Conclusions: Environmental samples look promising in replacing direct contact sampling. Environmental and air sampling could become efficient surveillance tools at equestrian events; however, it needs threshold calculations for minimum detection levels. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: High intensive intermittent exercise (HIIE) is used to condition horses for racing. A study was done to examine the effect of short duration HIIE on the maximal speed (Speedmax) and v4 of 6 Thoroughbred race horses (v4: speed at which under defined conditions the blood lactate concentration [LA] reaches 4 mmol/l). Horses were exercised during 8 weeks with one HIIE session per week on a dirt track. A HIIE session consisted of two runs of 100 m each at near maximal speed separated by 10 minutes walking. After every second week during the conditioning period (CP) the number of runs was increased by one finishing with 5 runs per HIIE session in the last two weeks of CP. Prior to the CP, horses performed a submaximal standardized exercise test (SETsubmaximal) and a maximal speed test (SETspeedmax) to determine their v4 and Speedmax respectively. SETsubmaximal was conducted every 2 weeks until the end of CP and SETspeedmax after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of CP. The v4 of horses declined during the first 4 weeks of CP (p < 0.05), but returned to initial levels thereafter. Speedmax remained equal over time. The results indicate that further studies need to be done to find optimal combinations of exercises to simultaneously increase Speedmax and v4 of horses. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To retrospectively report the historical and clinical findings, diagnostics, treatment, and outcome of horses with penetrating wood foreign bodies (PWFBs) of the coronary band. ANIMALS 15 client-owned horses. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Horses had varying degrees of lameness and soft tissue swelling of the coronary band and pastern region. A defect in the coronary band was identified, but the actual wood foreign body was not always readily visualized. RESULTS Medical records of horses diagnosed with PWFBs of the coronary band between 2004 and 2023 were reviewed. Information retrieved from the medical records included history, signalment, diagnostics, treatment, and outcome. Thirteen of 15 horses that sustained a PWFB to the coronary band were participating in foxhunting. Penetrating wood foreign bodies occurred more frequently near the central axis or toe region (11/15) and more commonly in the forelimbs (11/15). Removal of PWFBs can be performed with the horse standing and sedated with regional anesthesia. Complete removal of the PWFB required partial removal of the adjacent hoof wall. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Penetrating wood foreign bodies occurred in the coronary band and lodged distally in the hoof wall of horses. Foxhunting may be a risk factor for this type of injury. Penetrating wood foreign bodies occurred most commonly in the front feet, near the central axis of the coronary band. Complete removal of the PWFB required removing a section of the adjacent hoof wall. The prognosis for return to the previous level of activity following treatment was favorable. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication after celiotomy in horses, leading to increased morbidity and costs. Increased concern about antibiotic resistance justifies evaluation of alternative preventive approaches, such a Manuka honey which has displayed antimicrobial properties. Pectin-Honey Hydrogels (PHH), composed by Manuka honey and pectin provide a moist wound environment and microbial growth inhibition. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PHHs in preventing SSI in horses subjected to emergency laparotomy. Horses undergoing laparotomy were evaluated. Horses were randomly divided into two groups: Group 1 received PHH application onto the sutured linea alba before skin closure, while Group 2 received no treatment. Horses with postoperative antimicrobial administration or survival of less than 5 days were excluded. The incidence of SSIs was reported as percentages and compared between groups. Out of 44 horses enrolled in the study, only thirty-six were ultimately included. Exclusions occurred either due to death before 5 days postoperatively (2 horses) or the administration of postoperative antimicrobials (6 horses). The median length of hospitalization was 9 days (range 8–14 days). The overall occurrence of SSI was 19.4 %. One out of eighteen horses (5.5 %) in Group 1 and 6 out of 18 (33.3 %) horses in Group 2 developed SSI. Group 2 had an 8.5-fold increased risk of SSI (p = 0.035, OR = 8.5, 95 % CI. 0.9–80.07). No macroscopically visible adverse reactions were associated with PHH. PHH placed at the abdominal incision during surgery was safe and reduced the prevalence of SSI in horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: A clinical study was conducted with an aim to determine the extent of changes in biochemical parameters in healthy horses and those with upper respiratory tract affection both at rest and after exertion. There was a significant change in the level of creatinine kinase in horses with exercise intolerance, poor performance and healthy horses before and after exercise. A significant decrease in the creatinine kinase level was noticed in clinical group (122.8±8.52 IU/L) when compared to that of control group (187.93±14.72 IU/L) before exercise and also there was a significant decrease in the creatinine kinase in clinical group (158.12±15.13 IU/L) when compared to that control group (187.93±14.72 IU/L) after exercise. © 2024 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: Background: Detailed descriptions of clinical signs associated with radiological findings of the caudal cervical vertebral column are not available. Objectives/Hypotheses: Describe the clinical features associated with neck pain or stiffness, neck-related thoracic limb lameness, proprioceptive ataxia consistent with a cervicothoracic spinal cord or nerve lesion, and their frequency of occurrence compared with control horses. Animals: A total of 223 Warmblood horses. Methods: Case-control study. Controls and cases were recruited prospectively. All horses underwent predetermined lameness and neurologic examinations. The frequency of occurrence of each clinical feature was compared between cases and controls and relative risk (RR) were calculated. Results: Ninety-six cases and 127 controls were included. Forty-seven (49%) of the cases were classified as neurologic, 31 (32.3%) had thoracic limb lameness, and 18 (18.7%) had neck stiffness or pain or both. Focal caudal cervical muscle atrophy (46, 47.9%), hypoesthesia (38, 39.6%), patchy sweating (16, 16.7%), hyperesthesia (11, 11.5%), and pain upon firm pressure applied over the caudal cervical articular process joints and transverse processes (58, 60.4%) were only observed in cases (P <.001). Sideways flexion of the neck was restricted in a higher proportion of cases (47/96, 49%) compared with controls (40/127, 31.8%; P =.009, RR 1.5). Hopping-type thoracic limb lameness was only observed in cases, (30, 31.6%). Deterioration in lameness after diagnostic anesthesia occurred in 13/31 (41.9%) cases. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Systematic clinical evaluation using the methods described should enable clinical differentiation between horses with caudal cervical lesions and horses with other causes of gait abnormalities. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: It is thought horses lack the prospection and brain architecture required for goal-directed, reflective model-based learning which considers future states. We investigate whether horses can use model-based strategy in an inhibitory task. Twenty subjects were trained for three sessions of a Stop-Signal paradigm using positive reinforcement (+R) for correct responding. All twenty failed to reach learning criterion. Subjects continued to touch in “Stop” contingencies indicating horses either: cannot complete Stop-Signal tasks; need further consolidation; or are utilising model-based cost-benefit analysis. Subjects underwent a further three sessions with the addition of negative punishment (+R/-P) as a cost for errors of emission (EE). If horses lack the ability to complete Stop-Signal tasks, EE would remain high across both treatments. If horses found Stop-Signal difficult but the introduction of cost aided their learning, EE would gradually decrease throughout the +R/-P condition. If horses built a cognitive model of the task but developed a strategy of indiscriminate responding in the +R condition, EE would suddenly decrease with the introduction of cost. A significant, immediate reduction in EE was observed when cost was introduced (p=0.02) that remained stable throughout the +R/-P condition providing evidence consistent with model-based cost-benefit analysis in horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Numerous mouth injuries have been reported in relation to bit use in horses. Rein tension is a potential risk factor, as it exerts pressure on the rostral parts of the mouth via the bit. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate rein tension during driving and its association with horse behaviour and mouth injuries. Eight horses were driven clockwise on a 1000 m oval racetrack for 3–4 km at walk and trot. Rein tension was measured with two IPOS rein sensors. Researchers filmed the horse's behaviour from a vehicle moving alongside the horse on the outer track. The bit area of the mouth was examined before and after the session. One observer, blinded to the rein tension and mouth injury results, coded behaviours from videos according to a predefined ethogram. Median rein tensions in one rein ranged from 5 N to 36 N. Maximum rein tensions ranged from 106 N to 236 N. Five 30-second data subsets, representing samples of Low, Medium1, Medium2, High and Peak tension, were visually selected from the rein tension graphs to investigate behaviour differences during different rein tension levels. The durations of unrushed walk (P < 0.001) and mouth closed (P = 0.003) were longer in the Low rein tension subset. The durations of slow (P = 0.01) and fast trot (P = 0.003), mouth widely (P = 0.02) or repeatedly open (P = 0.03) were longer in the higher rein tension subsets. None of the horses had any prior mouth injuries in the bit area. After driving, three horses experienced moderate bruising. Their median rein tension was numerically higher (left 35 N; right 34 N) than that in horses without injuries (22 N; 18 N), and they showed longer periods of rushed walk (P = 0.04). Rein tensions were quite high, as previous studies suggest that horses find tensions above 6–10 N aversive. Horse trainers should monitor the horse's mouth behaviour, arousal state and ability to walk calmly and modify training accordingly, as mouth widely or repeatedly open at higher rein tensions may indicate aversion (mouth discomfort/pain) and rushed walk may indicate high arousal, which in turn may increase the risk for mouth injury. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Nanoplastics, tiny plastic particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, have gained increasing attention due to their potential environmental and health impacts. This comprehensive review discusses the recent trend of nano plastics (NPs) formation, their physicochemical properties, novel detection techniques, and ecological impacts. Primary NPs arise from the degradation of larger plastic particles into nano-sized fragments, a process that can occur naturally through exposure to sunlight and weathering. Secondary nanoplastics are directly introduced into the environment in nano-sized form, originating from sources such as cosmetics, sunscreens, detergents and industrial processes. The physicochemical properties of NPs in terms of size, surface area-to-volume ratio, binding capacity, and potential for aggregation with toxic substances are also discussed. Various NPs detection techniques, such as spectroscopy (UV–Vis, Raman), microscopy (optical, electron, atomic), fluorescence, particle counting, and chemical analysis are also deliberated. Specifically, the role of NPs as carriers for transferring toxic chemicals to the organisms as well as entering into the human food chain is also explored. Recent technological innovations in the removal of NPs from wastewater, in terms of membrane-based filtration, adsorption (nanomaterials, microalgae, and natural adsorbents), electrocoagulation, hybrid membrane processes, and advanced oxidation processes are also highlighted. Finally, we emphasize the research gaps and future directions of NPs' toxicity and risk management. © The Tunisian Chemical Society and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasonographic imaging of the diaphragm is a non-invasive alternative for respiratory function evaluation in horses. This study aimed to measure diaphragm thickness, thickening (change in thickness with contraction) and thickening fraction in healthy adult horses during tidal breathing and forced vital capacity. Correlation between body weight (≤400 kg and >400 kg) and diaphragm thickness was investigated. To that purpose, 20 adult horses, weight 409±50 kg, height 1.47±0.05 m, and age 16±6 years were included in the study. Diaphragm thickness was measured at end-inspiration and end-expiration using B-mode and M-mode. The transducer was placed in the 10th, 11th and 12th intercostal spaces of both hemithoraces. Measurements obtained at end inspiration using M-mode during forced vital capacity were greater than for tidal breathing for diaphragm thickness (P=0.006), diaphragm thickening (P<0.001) and thickening fraction (P<0.001). The same was found for thickening (P<0.001) and thickening fraction (P<0.001). Diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration was greater in horses weighing >400kg than those ≤400kg at the inspiration (0.93±0.2 cm and 0.74±0 0.02 cm, P<0.001) and at the end of expiration (0.77±0.02 cm and 0.63±0, 02 cm, P<0.001). There was no difference in thickening fraction between horses weighing ≤400kg and >400kg (tidal breathing: 18±2 % and 16±2 %, P=0.609; forced vital capacity: 39±6 % and 31±5 %, P=0.301). Diaphragm assessment in horses is possible using both B-mode and M-mode. Breathing workload has a positive correlation between breathing workload and diaphragm contraction. Due to the relationship demonstrated between diaphragm thickness and weight, it is recommended that diaphragm thickening fraction is used to compare diaphragm measurements between horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to delineate the detailed anatomy of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in healthy horses using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). The fetlock region of 15 cadaveric forelimbs and 14 cadaveric hindlimbs from nine adult horses without orthopaedic disease underwent CBCT scanning. Additionally, arthrography CBCT scans were conducted following intra-articular injection of a radiopaque contrast medium containing blue epoxy resin dye. Subsequently, limbs were frozen and sectioned to visualize anatomical structures in sectional planes corresponding to selected CBCT images. CBCT proved suitable for detailed visualization of the bony components of the fetlock region. Furthermore, the common digital extensor tendon, superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, suspensory ligament, and straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments were identifiable on CBCT images. However, certain ligaments, such as the collateral sesamoidean ligaments and intersesamoidean ligaments, were not clearly identified. The hyaline cartilage of the MCP and MTP joint facets was assessable on the post-contrast sequence. In cases where a radiographic or ultrasound examination cannot provide a definitive diagnosis and determine the extent of disease, CBCT can provide additional valuable data on the equine MCP and MTP joint. The images obtained in this study can serve as a reference for CBCT examination of the equine MCP and MTP joint. © 2024 The Author(s). Anatomia, Histologia, Embryologia published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: CD25, the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain, is expressed on cell surfaces of different immune cells and is commonly used for phenotyping of regulatory T cells (Tregs). CD25 has essential roles in the maintenance of hemostasis and immune tolerance and Treg cell involvement has been shown in human diseases and murine models for allergy, autoimmunity, cancer, chronic inflammation, and many others. In horses, a cross-reactive anti-human CD25 antibody has previously been used for characterizing Tregs. Here, we developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to equine CD25 and compared their staining pattern with the anti-human CD25 antibody by flow cytometry. The comparison of the two reagents was performed by two separate analyses in independent laboratories. Overall, similar staining patterns for equine peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained with the anti-human CD25 antibody and equine CD25 mAb 15–1 in both laboratories. Both reagents identified comparable CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ percentages after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with pokeweed mitogen. However, when compared to the anti-human CD25 antibody, the equine CD25 mAb 15–1 resulted in a better staining intensity of the equine CD25+ cells and increased the percentages of Tregs and other CD25+ cells ex vivo and after culturing of PBMC without stimulation. In summary, the equine CD25 mAbs provide new, improved reagents for Tregs and CD25+ cell phenotyping in horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Cyathostomins are the largest group of parasites in horses that can be controlled by ivermectin (IVM). This study aimed to run a four-dose titration trial of IVM in 28 naturally infected Thoroughbred yearlings. The local Strongyle population had been recorded to be resistant to IVM (200 µg/kg). The parasite fecal egg count (FEC) was performed to investigate the egg reappearance period (ERP) of two and five weeks (w2pt and w5pt) after IVM treatment. FEC was > 1000 on day zero for all groups. Although 100% FEC reduction was reported at w2pt for all concentrations, the FEC at w5pt revealed < 83% efficacy. This study reports the reduction of ERP using the label dose as well as 300, and 400 µg/kg (double dose) of IVM. The protocol allowed IVM to significantly suppress FEC w2pt although not eliminating adult worms, failing to guarantee an extension of its protection period over 8 weeks. Moreover, the FEC at w5pt possibly means the infection was not cleared, and worms reestablished egg laying. We raised the possibility of withdrawing IVM of control programs when the drug has less than 80% FEC reduction at w5pt. © 2024, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Oromaxillary fistulae are a complication of maxillary cheek teeth extraction in horses, particularly in cases where tooth repulsion is performed. Conservative treatment with debridement of the fistula, placement of a temporary alveolar plug and flushing of the sinus cavity can be unsuccessful. Transposition of the levator labii superioris muscle has been reported as an effective surgical option to treat chronic oromaxillary fistulae in anaesthetised horses. In this report, the surgical procedure was carried out on two standing horses, using sedation and local nerve blocks. Transposition of the levator labii superioris muscle can be safely and successfully performed in the standing sedated horse and may be considered for the management of cases with chronic refractory oromaxillary fistulae not responding to conservative treatment. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Non-native species can affect ecosystems by influencing native predator-prey dynamics. Therefore, management interventions designed to remove non-natives may inadvertently lead to increased predation on native species. Feral horses are widely distributed throughout the arid parts of western North America. A growing body of research indicates that horses can be an important prey species to mountain lions in ecosystems where they overlap. In December 2020, the Bureau of Land Management removed 455 horses from the Delamar Mountains, Nevada, USA. We leveraged this management intervention to implement a before–after–control–impact study to test hypotheses about predation on horses and native ungulates. We predicted (1) that horses would comprise an important part of the diet in this mixed-prey community, (2) following removal, the proportion of horses in the diet would decrease and native ungulates would increase, and (3) mountain lion home ranges overlapping the treatment areas would increase in response to decreased prey availability. From 2018 to 2022, we investigated 1360 clusters from 29 GPS-collared lions and identified 1056 prey items. To model the probability of a predation event (a kill), we fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model for ungulate prey as a function of lion sex, treatment area (in/out), and treatment period (pre-/post-removal). We used a log-linear regression model to evaluate changes in home range size. The most common prey were mule deer (55%), feral horses (32%), and coyotes (4%). Twenty-two of 29 lions consumed horses, although the rate of horse consumption was highly variable across individuals. Horses of both sexes and all age classes were predated. In contrast to predictions, our models detected no effect of removals on diet composition (βinteraction = 0.30 ± 1.1), nor did the removal influence home range size (βinteraction = 0.02 ± 0.02). Despite a 46% reduction in horse abundance, we found no evidence for prey-switching following the horse removal treatment. Removal magnitude, rapid horse immigration, and/or behavioral specialization of individual mountain lions may help explain these results. Our findings have important implications for mountain lion and feral horse management in arid environments characterized by high prey diversity, but low prey abundance. Published 2024.

ABSTRACT: An 8-year-old Warmblood cross mare was presented for further investigation of an acute-onset lameness of the right hindlimb. Three weeks prior to presentation, the horse was found markedly lame at walk following a fall during exercise. The horse was initially managed with field rest, but the lameness persisted. A marked right hindlimb lameness at trot graded 5/10 was confirmed. Atrophy of the right gluteal musculature was evident, and palpation over the region of the right coxofemoral joint provoked a pain reaction. Nuclear scintigraphy revealed a diffuse area of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the right femoral head, neck and greater trochanter. Radiographs identified a complete, slightly displaced fracture of the base of the greater trochanter of the right femur. Ultrasound examination of the proximal femur demonstrated an irregularity of the caudolateral bone surface of the greater trochanter, extending along its attachment to the femur; this was consistent with the radiological findings. On re-examination, after 9 months of stable rest, the horse was found to be sound when trotted in a straight line on the hard surface. Follow-up two and a half years after the initial incident reported the horse to be nonlame and at its previous level of work. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A 23-y-old gelding was presented to a veterinary teaching hospital with a history of chronic, refractory diarrhea. Clinically, the horse was in poor body condition, with a thickened and corrugated large intestine identified by transcutaneous abdominal ultrasonography. At postmortem examination following euthanasia, the large colon and cecum had segmental thickening of the intestinal wall with innumerable mucosal ulcers and prominent polypoid mucosal masses. Many mesenteric and hepatic lymph nodes were enlarged. Histology revealed granulomatous and ulcerative typhlocolitis and granulomatous lymphadenitis with myriad acid-fast, variably gram-positive, intrahistiocytic bacilli that stained by immunohistochemistry for mycobacteria. Molecular testing by PCR and sequencing identified the causative agent as Mycobacterium genavense, which is an unusual presentation of infection in a horse. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: To achieve salt reduction while ensuring flavor quality of Chinese horse bean-chili-paste (CHCP), we comprehensively explored the effect of indigenous strains Tetragenococcus halophilus and Candida versatilis on the aroma profiles of low-salt CHCP by metabolomics and sensomics analysis. A total of 129 volatiles and 34 aroma compounds were identified by GC × GC-MS and GC-O-MS, among which 29 and 20 volatiles were identified as significant difference compounds and aroma-active compounds, respectively. Inoculation with the two indigenous strains could effectively relieve the undesired acidic and irritative flavor brought by acetic acid and some aldehydes in salt-reduction samples. Meanwhile, inoculated fermentation provided more complex and richer volatiles in low-salt batches, especially for the accumulation of 3-methylbutanol, 1-octen-3-ol, benzeneacetaldehyde, phenylethyl alcohol, and 4-ethyl-phenol etc., which were confirmed as essential aroma compounds of CHCP by recombination and omission tests. The research elucidated the feasibility of bioturbation strategy to achieve salt-reducing fermentation of fermented foods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) competitions evaluate riders on equitation and skills when riding randomly drawn horses. This study considered demographic and competition-related variables of horses involved in IHSA competitions, and their correlation to performance through points accumulated. Demographics were recorded for fifty-nine horses in two-day Hunter Seat and Western IHSA shows along with use of artificial riding aids, day of competition, number of rides, and points, to evaluate performance. Data were analyzed using a mixed effect model and correlation coefficients with significance set at P < 0.05 (SAS 9.4). Hunter Seat horses averaged more rides per day than Western (P < 0.0001), but points per ride were not different between disciplines (P = 0.57) or days of shows (P = 0.47). Use of artificial aids did not impact points per ride a horse accumulated (P = 0.63 Hunter Seat, P = 0.41 Western). Age, (r = -0.10, P = 0.60; r = 0.02, P = 0.90), BCS (r = 0.15, P = 0.42; r = 0.17, P = 0.34), height (r = 0.20, P = 0.28; r = 0.15, P = 0.39), and weight (r = 0.23, P = 0.23; r = 0.20, P = 0.25) were weakly correlated with points earned for Hunter Seat and Western horses, respectively. Random draw in IHSA is suggested to be effective for equitation competitions, allowing a fair opportunity for riders, regardless of the horse-related factors evaluated in this study. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The article presents data on activity in the field of embryo transfer in the Russian horse breeding system and analyzes of the factors influencing the success of the use of this technology. The results of Russian reproductive specialists work over the past 15 years have been collected (144 procedures of embryo recovery in 52 mares). The influence of age and degree of synchronization of ovulations between donors and recipients on the level of embryo recovery and survival rates was analyzed. It has been established that the highest embryo recovery rate is observed in mares of 2-10 years old (yo) -84.6%. In mares of 11-16 yo, this figure decreased to 64.3% (p< 0.05), and for 17-24 yo mares -to 42.8% (p< 0.001). The survival rate of embryos in the uterus of recipient mares of 3-14 yo remains at 70-71%, in mares of 15-20 yo it sharply decreased to 42.8%. It has been shown that embryo transfer to a recipient whose ovulation occurred 1 day earlier or within a period of up to 5 days after the donor's ovulation provides a survival rate of 79% until the 35th day of pregnancy. When the recipient ovulation occurs 2-4 days earlier than the donor ovulation, the result of embryo transfer was dramatically reduced (7,7±7,4%, p< 0.001). © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

ABSTRACT: Accurate and efficient access to Mongolian horse body size information is an important component in the modernization of the equine industry. Aiming at the shortcomings of manual measurement methods, such as low efficiency and high risk, this study converts the traditional horse body measure measurement problem into a measurement keypoint localization problem and proposes a top-down automatic Mongolian horse body measure measurement method by integrating the target detection algorithm and keypoint detection algorithm. Firstly, the SimAM parameter-free attention mechanism is added to the YOLOv8n backbone network to constitute the SimAM–YOLOv8n algorithm, which provides the base image for the subsequent accurate keypoint detection; secondly, the coordinate regression-based RTMPose keypoint detection algorithm is used for model training to realize the keypoint localization of the Mongolian horse. Lastly, the cosine annealing method was employed to dynamically adjust the learning rate throughout the entire training process, and subsequently conduct body measurements based on the information of each keypoint. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the SimAM–YOLOv8n algorithm proposed in this study was 90.1%, and the average accuracy of the RTMPose algorithm was 91.4%. Compared with the manual measurements, the shoulder height, chest depth, body height, body length, croup height, angle of shoulder and angle of croup had mean relative errors (MRE) of 3.86%, 4.72%, 3.98%, 2.74%, 2.89%, 4.59% and 5.28%, respectively. The method proposed in this study can provide technical support to realize accurate and efficient Mongolian horse measurements. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Emerging antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has forced an urgent need for alternative non-antibiotic strategies development that could combat drug resistant-associated infections. Suppression of virulence of ESKAPE pathogens' by targeting multiple virulence traits provides a promising approach. Objectives: Here we propose an iron-blocking antibacterial therapy based on a cationic heme-mimetic gallium porphyrin (GaCHP), which antibacterial efficacy could be further enhanced by photodynamic inactivation. Methods: We used gallium heme mimetic porphyrin (GaCHP) excited with light to significantly reduce microbial viability and suppress both the expression and biological activity of several virulence traits of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative ESKAPE representatives, i.e., S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Moreover, further improvement of the proposed strategy by combining it with routinely used antimicrobials to resensitize the microbes to antibiotics and provide enhanced bactericidal efficacy was investigated. Results: The proposed strategy led to substantial inactivation of critical priority pathogens and has been evidenced to suppress the expression and biological activity of multiple virulence factors in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Finally, the combination of GaCHP phototreatment and antibiotics resulted in promising strategy to overcome antibiotic resistance of the studied microbes and to enhance disinfection of drug resistant pathogens. Conclusion: Lastly, considering high safety aspects of the proposed treatment toward host cells, i.e., lack of mutagenicity, no dark toxicity and mild phototoxicity, we describe an efficient alternative that simultaneously suppresses the functionality of multiple virulence factors in ESKAPE pathogens. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To describe dermoid cyst formation as an uncommon complication of the pinch grafting technique in horses. Study design: Case report. Animal: A 8 year old Arabian gelding. Methods: Clinical presentation, imaging, treatment, and histopathology records were reviewed. The horse originally presented due to delayed healing of a laceration to the distal aspect of the metatarsus. The wound was treated initially with debridement and it was allowed to fill with healthy granulation tissue prior to pinch grafting. Two months after grafting, the horse started to show self-mutilation behavior targeting the wound site. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of cystic lesions in the subcutaneous tissue in the wound bed and adjacent to the long digital extensor tendon. Results: Treatment involved surgical excision of the cysts, which resulted in a resolution of the self-mutilation episodes. The specimens were submitted for histopathological investigation, which revealed findings compatible with dermoid cyst formation, suspected to be secondary to the skin-grafting procedure. Conclusion: Dermoid cysts formation should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis for skin graft complications in horses. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Every year, many horses are transported by air. Alongside sport horses traveling to tournaments worldwide, mainly breeding horses, such as shuttle stallions and broodmares, thoroughbreds traded at auctions, and leisure horses are transported by air. Research in veterinary science has highlighted welfare concerns during air transportation. Equine welfare is constituted in the language and discourse evolving from social, political, and ethical views about the treatment of horses. Consequently, this study targets power in creating equine welfare by analyzing the welfare discourses, transportation practices that generate welfare, and their impact on horses and humans in the transportation of horses by air. In detail, this research uses a Foucauldian discourse analysis to examine how welfare discourses and linked transportation practices constitute horses and humans using disciplinary power. The empirical material consists of 81 newspaper articles about horse transportation by air, five video clips, and four interviews with representatives of horse transport agencies that have set standards for the transportation of horses by air. The analysis discovers four different welfare discourses and various practices that guide the carrying of horses by air. The discourses have created inactive horses and human professionals in the business of horse transportation by air. © 2024 by the author.

ABSTRACT: In Argentina, as in the rest of the world, cyathostomins are the most common nematodes parasitizing horses. Control is based almost exclusively on the administration of benzimidazoles, pyrimidines, and macrocyclic lactones. However, intensive use of these drugs is resulting in the development of anthelmintic resistance (AR). For example, AR to benzimidazoles is currently distributed throughout Argentina, while incipient AR to pyrimidines (pyrantel embonate) is appearing in areas where this drug is used. Macrocyclic lactones and especially ivermectin, are by far the most used drugs by the vast majority of equine premises in the country. Although ivermectin has been used since 1982, its efficacy against equine strongylid parasites has remained very high until the present. In this study we report for the first time, the presence of a cyathostomin population with resistance to ivermectin in adult horses belonging to an equine premise located in central Argentina. Fecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) were performed following the most recent guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) for the diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance (research protocol) and resistance was considered when the Upper 90% Credible Interval fell below the expected efficacy threshold of 99.9%. Calculations were carried out using two different online calculation interfaces suggested by WAAVP. For the 14-day post-treatment interval, ivermectin efficacy was 79.5% (90% Credible Interval: 68.1–88.8) and 79.3% (74.2–83.6.3%) with the two methods, respectively. At 19 days post treatment, fecal egg count reductions were 68.6% (50.5–83.1) and 68.4% (61.9–74.1), respectively. At both intervals, this cyathostomin population fullfilled the criteria for AR. These findings suggest dispersion of ivermectin resistant cyathostomins in Argentina. Given the widespread use of macrocyclic lactones, it is important that veterinarians and the equine industry promote a more selective and evidence-based use of these drugs and establish routine monitoring to determine anthelmintic field efficacy to detect treatment failures as early as possible and avoid potential health problems as well as further spread of resistant genes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Animal welfare has become an increasingly important concern regarding equids working as carriage animals. In the present study, the changes in the markers of stress and inflammatory responses as a result of the work performed by tourism carriage horses under real working conditions in Sicily (Italy) were investigated. Twenty-two Standardbreds performed a normal working day in the carriage tourism business during the months of May, June and July 2022, consisting of one day of work for each month. Blood samples were collected in the stables at rest before the tour route (Pre; 07.00 AM) and within 10 min after the end of the workday (Post; 05.00 PM). Haematological parameters, serum concentration of cortisol, total proteins together with the globulin fractions were investigated before and after the carriage work. Environmental temperature, relative humidity and temperature humidity index (THI) were also assessed. The direct erythrocyte indices increased after work compared to rest condition (P < 0.05). The values of cortisol, total proteins and globulins were not affected by carriage work (P > 0.05), while, higher cortisol, total proteins, α1- and α2-globulins values were observed in July compared to May and June (P < 0.05). These changes are probably due to the increase in THI values which showed mild stress in June and high stress in July. This study suggests that the tourism carriage horses herein investigated have adapted to their work activity, however, avoiding working horses during the hottest hours of the day in the summer months is advocated. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Recombinant intracameral tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) administration can aid clearance of fibrin from the anterior chamber. Materials and methods: In this retrospective multicentre case series, the effect of intracameral rTPA administration to treat fibrin in the anterior chamber resulting from trauma or inflammatory ocular disease was evaluated. Clinical data from 30 treatments in 29 horses were obtained from medical records from 2003 to 2022. Association between time from onset of clinical signs and time for rTPA treatment to effect was studied with regression analysis. Results: Twenty-seven horses (93.1%) had no previous history of ophthalmic disease; one had an iridic cyst, and another had equine recurrent uveitis. The majority of cases were related to trauma (79.3%). Median time from the onset of clinical signs to treatment was 12 h (IQR = 4–48 h). rTPA (72% 20 µg; 24% 25 µg; 3.3% 40 µg) was administered once in all but one eye, which was treated twice. Resolution of fibrin was seen in 96.9% (29/30) of treatments. Fibrin accumulation recurred in one case but resolved 14 days after the second treatment. Complications were seen in four treatments (13.3%): moderate pain for 24 h, intracameral debris and mild intracameral haemorrhage in a horse that received 40 µg of tissue plasminogen activator. Recurrence of fibrin accumulation was absent in 96.7% of cases. Median time to effect was 20 min (IQR = 10–45 min). Time for rTPA treatment to effect was not associated with time from fibrin formation (R2 = 0.09; p = 0.11).

ABSTRACT: Background/Objectives: The public perception relating to the welfare of horses involved with equestrian sports is associated with training methods used and the presentation of horses at events. In this context, very tight nosebands, which are intended to prevent the horse from opening its mouth, also attract a lot of attention. Various studies have evaluated the impact of tight nosebands on stress parameters, whereas the effect of tight nosebands on upper airway function is unknown. Therefore, the aim of the study was to use overground endoscopy to evaluate changes in pharyngeal and laryngeal function when a tight noseband is fitted. Moreover, the ridden horse pain ethogram (RHpE) was applied to investigate signs of discomfort (Dyson et al., 2018). Study design: A randomized, blinded, and prospective study was performed. Methods: Sixteen warmblood horses consisting of twelve mares and four geldings with a mean age of 11.63 ± 3.53 years were ridden on 2 consecutive days with either loose or tight nosebands (two fingers or no space between bridge of the nose and noseband, respectively) and inserted endoscope in a random order. Videos were taken in a riding arena during a standardized exercise protocol involving beginner level tasks for 30 min in all gaits. For video analysis, freeze frames were prepared and analyzed at the beginning of the expiration phase. Pharyngeal diameter was measured using the pharynx-epiglottis ratio. Other findings (swallowing, pharyngeal collapse, soft palate movements, and secretion) were also evaluated. Moreover, the RHpE was applied. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed effects models were used. Results with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: While the pharynx-epiglottis ratio did not change significantly in horses ridden with loose versus tight nosebands, there was an increase in mean grade and total counts of parameters assessed in the pharyngeal region, for example, grade of secretion (1.5 [±SD 0.89] vs. 3.13 [±SD 0.96]; p = 0.0001), axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds (0.29 [±SD 0.73] vs. 1.33 [±SD 1.44]; p = 0.01), and pharyngeal collapse (0.69 [±SD 0.87] vs. 1.88 [±SD 1.54]; p = 0.005) in horses ridden with tight nosebands. There was no RHpE score above 8 indicating musculoskeletal pain, but the RHpE scores were significantly higher in horses ridden with tight nosebands (p < 0.001). Main limitations: Video quality was limited when horses showed large amounts of secretion. Another limitation was the small number of horses. Conclusions: Results add to the evidence obtained in other studies that tight nosebands do not only cause adverse reactions based on the RHpE score such as head behind the vertical or intense staring but also contribute to changes in the pharyngeal region, such as increased secretion and collapse of pharyngeal structures. This may provide further support for future decisions regarding regulations on nosebands. © 2024 The Author(s). Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In insulin dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia (HI) can be accompanied by peripheral insulin resistance (IR) in horses, which can be diagnosed with an insulin-tolerance test (ITT). The administration of 0.1 IU/kg body weight of recombinant regular human insulin (RHI) should elicit a 50 % reduction of the initial blood glucose concentration at 30 min after insulin administration in insulin sensitive horses. Compared to RHI, porcine zinc insulin (PZI) is veterinary-approved and therefore easier accessible for many practitioners. The aim of this study was to compare the insulin and glucose dynamics during a standard ITT with RHI to an ITT performed with PZI. Twelve Icelandic horses were subjected to an ITT with RHI (ITT-RHI) and with PZI (ITT-PZI) at same dosages in a randomised crossover design. The insulin and glucose dynamics that resulted from these tests were compared, and the consistency of classification into insulin-sensitive and IR categories was evaluated. No complications were observed with the use of either RHI or PZI in ITT. A good correlation of the test results was observed (r = 0.88; P < 0.001). The blood glucose concentrations and the percentage reduction in glucose concentration did not differ significantly between the two tests (P = 0.053), but four out of twelve horses were classified as IR in the ITT-RHI whereas with the ITT-PZI seven out of twelve horses were classified as IR with the 50 % glucose reduction from baseline. Based on the Youden index, when using the ITT-PZI, an adjusted cut-off value for blood glucose reduction of 40 % at 30 min resulted in better test performance. With consideration for the seemingly weaker effect of PZI and the adjusted cut-off value, PZI can be an appropriate substitute to RHI in an ITT. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Recently, horses and other domestic mammals have been shown to perceive and react to human emotional signals, with most studies focusing on joy and anger. In this study, we tested whether horses can learn to identify human joyful and sad expressions against other emotions. We used a touchscreen-based automated device that presented pairs of human portraits and distributed pellets when the horse touched the rewarded face. Six horses were trained to touch the sad face and 5 the joyful face. By the end of training, horses’ performances at the group level were significantly higher than chance level, with higher scores for horses trained with the sad face. At the individual level, evidence of task learning varied among horses, which could be explained by individual variations in horses’ ability to identify different human facial expressions or attention issues during the tests. In a generalization test, we introduced portraits of different humans than those presented during training. Horses trained with the joyful face performed better than chance, demonstrating generalization. Conversely, horses trained with the sad face did not. Horses also showed differences in learning performance according to the non-rewarded emotion, providing insights into horses’ cognitive processing of facial expressions. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate changes in body temperature in athletic horses during two different road transport distances. Six Italian Saddle horses were subjected to a 100 and 300 km transport during different times of day (am and pm). Rectal and cutaneous temperatures were recorded before (T0), immediately (following 5 min- T1) and 1 hour (T2) after transport by means of a rectal digital thermometer and a thermal infrared camera (FLIR T440) respectively, for the evaluation of left and right side of four body regions: jugular, shoulder, croup and inner thigh. There were no differences between left and right sides, inner thigh or rectal temperatures when comparing the transport distance, time points or time of day. At T0, jugular (P < 0.0001), shoulder (P < 0.01) and croup (P < 0.01) average temperatures were higher in the pm compared to those in the am in both journeys. At T1, jugular (P < 0.01) and croup (P < 0.01) temperatures were lower in the pm compared to am following the 300 km journey. Jugular temperature (P < 0.0001) was higher following the 300 km compared to the 100 km journey at each time point (T1 and T2) at both times of day (am and pm). Shoulder (P < 0.0001) and croup temperatures (P < 0.0001) were higher at T2 after the 300 km journey than at T2 after the 100 km journey). The current results suggested a difference between the two distances and the time of day appeared to have as great effect on ocular temperature as road transport distance © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Excessive inbreeding increases the probability of uncovering homozygous recessive genotypes and has been associated with an increased risk of retained placenta and lower semen quality. No genomic analysis has investigated the association between inbreeding levels and pregnancy loss. Objectives: To compare genetic inbreeding coefficients (F) of naturally occurring Thoroughbred Early Pregnancy Loss (EPLs), Mid and Late term Pregnancy Loss (MLPL) and Controls. The F value was hypothesised to be higher in cases of pregnancy loss (EPLs and MLPLs) than Controls. Study design: Observational case–control study. Methods: Allantochorion and fetal DNA from EPL (n = 37, gestation age 14–65 days), MLPL (n = 94, gestational age 70 days–24 h post parturition) and Controls (n = 58) were genotyped on the Axiom Equine 670K SNP Genotyping Array. Inbreeding coefficients using Runs of Homozygosity (FROH) were calculated using PLINK software. ROHs were split into size categories to investigate the recency of inbreeding. Results: MLPLs had significantly higher median number of ROH (188 interquartile range [IQR], 180.8–197.3), length of ROH (3.10, IQR 2.93–3.33), and total number of ROH (590.8, IQR 537.3–632.3), and FROH (0.26, IQR 0.24–0.28) when compared with the Controls and the EPLs (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in any of the inbreeding indices between the EPLs and Controls. The MLPLs had a significantly higher proportion of long (>10 Mb) ROH (2.5%, IQR 1.6–3.6) than the Controls (1.7%, IQR 0.6–2.5), p = 0.001. No unique ROHs were found in the EPL or MLPL populations. Main limitations: SNP-array data does not allow analysis of every base in the sequence. Conclusions: This first study of the effect of genomic inbreeding levels on pregnancy loss showed that inbreeding is a contributor to MLPL, but not EPL in the UK Thoroughbred population. Mating choices remain critical, because inbreeding may predispose to MLPL by increasing the risk of homozygosity for specific lethal allele(s). © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Internal bleeding and mucosal bleeding in hollow organs are uncommon conditions in equine medicine and endoscopy. Most of the time, they respond to treatment of the underlying primary condition. However, there are cases in which a rapid and effective control of blood loss is required and the animal is not suited for surgery or general anaesthesia. We report two cases referred to our Veterinary Teaching Hospital with signs of urinary disease and bladder haemorrhage identified by cystoscopy which were successfully managed with topical application of a haemostatic carboxymethyl-starch powder. The product was applied directly on the bleeding mucosa after bladder emptying either under endoscopic guidance or blindly, through a urinary catheter. The application of the haemostatic powder appears to be easy to perform, safe and helpful in controlling mucosal bleeding in hollow organs in a short time, with no adverse reactions noticed. This approach should be considered in cases where mucosal bleeding can be identified by endoscopy and a prompt control of blood loss is required, also in the field. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Information regarding the histopathology of the proximal phalanx (P1) sagittal groove in racehorses is limited. Twenty-nine cadaver limbs from nine Thoroughbred racehorses in racing/race-training underwent histological examination. Histological specimens of the third metacarpal/metatarsal (MC3/MT3) parasagittal grooves and P1 sagittal grooves were graded for histopathological findings in hyaline cartilage (HC), calcified cartilage (CC), and subchondral plate and trabecular bone (SCB/TB) regions. Histopathological grades were compared between (1) fissure and non-fissure locations observed in a previous study and (2) dorsal, middle, and palmar/plantar aspects. (1) HC, CC, and SCB/TB grades were more severe in fissure than non-fissure locations in the MC3/MT3 parasagittal groove (p < 0.001). SCB/TB grades were more severe in fissure than non-fissure locations in the P1 sagittal groove (p < 0.001). (2) HC, CC, and SCB/TB grades including SCB collapse were more severe in the palmar/plantar than the middle aspect of the MC3/MT3 parasagittal groove (p < 0.001). SCB/TB grades including SCB collapse were more severe in the dorsal and middle than the palmar/plantar aspect of the P1 sagittal groove (p < 0.001). Histopathology in the SCB/TB region including bone fatigue injury was related to fissure locations, the palmar/plantar MC3/MT3 parasagittal groove, and the dorsal P1 sagittal groove. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study was conducted to secure basic data for improving the welfare of domestic breeding horses by measuring the accumulation of heart rate and lactic acid before and after exercise and measuring the concentration of Cortisol and HSP70 as indicators for horse stress. For three sessions before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 30 min after exercise, 15 Thoroughbred racing horses and 15 riding horses in domestic breeding were designated, and lactate was measured in plasma using a poly equine health check Polar H10 heart rate meter. In addition, the concentrations of HSP70 and Cortisol, which can be taken as values of stress in three sessions, were analyzed. The levels of HSP70 were measured as 29.43±5.72pg/mL before exercise, 89.74±23.02pg/mL after exercise, 32.19±6.57pg/mL after 30 min of exercise, 41.25±8.26pg/mL before exercise, and 114.02±29pg/mL after exercise (pg/mL) after exercise. Cortisol concentrations were found to be 3.38±1.2µg/dL before exercise, 5.11±1.16µg/dL immediately after exercise, 5.58±2.15µg/dL after 30 min of exercise, 6.61±2.04µg/dL before exercise, 8.47±2.55µg/dL immediately after exercise, and 30 min after exercise. Hematology chemistry in riding horse and racing horses had some differences by items, but there was no significant difference overall. In conclusion, it has been confirmed that racing horses have higher stress from strong exercise compared to riding horses, and plans to use it to promote the welfare of domestic horses in the future. © 2024, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment of glioma limit the efficacies of various therapies, and thus glioma treatment is challenging. We herein report semiconducting polymer nano-therapeutics (SPCFe/siP) that can achieve efficient delivery into orthotopic glioma sites via neutrophil-mediated BBB transport for sono-activatable ferroptosis-immunotherapy. Such SPCFe/siP contain a semiconducting polymer, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) siRNA and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles loaded into a singlet oxygen (1O2)-cleavable nanocarrier with surface conjugation of a neutrophil targeting ligand, sialic acid. SPCFe/siP effectively bind to neutrophils via sialic acid-based targeting pathway, and neutrophils containing SPCFe/siP serve as Trojan horses to migrate across BBB for improved delivery efficacy into orthotopic glioma sites. Upon irradiation by ultrasound (US), the semiconducting polymers produce 1O2 to destroy 1O2-cleavable nanocarriers for precise on-demand releases of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and PD-L1 siRNA, in which, Fe3O4 nanoparticles induce ferroptosis and subsequent immunogenic cell death (ICD), and PD-L1 siRNA downregulated the expression of PD-L1 for tumor cells, allowing for sono-activatable ferroptosis-immunotherapy. A strong immunological effect is formed, leading to noteworthy restriction of orthotopic glioma tumor growth and improvement of mouse survival. This study provides a neutrophil-targeting nanosystem with efficient brain delivery and activatable therapeutic action for treatment of orthotopic glioma. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasmosis is an important health concern for people and farm animals, leading to many studies on its effects on these populations. Despite this, there is a lack of research on the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection among horses in Iran. This study aims to determine the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis using the Modified Agglutination Test (MAT) in northwest Iran horses. In this study, blood samples were taken from 385 horses in Ardabil, East Azerbaijan, and West Azerbaijan provinces. Data regarding the age, gender, and location of each horse was documented to assess their impact on the prevalence of toxoplasmosis. The data was analyzed using the chi-square test, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Of the 385 samples, 34 (8.8%) were positive for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the 271 male and 114 female horses, 24 (8.9%) and 10 (8.8%) were seropositive, respectively. Of the 116 horses under and 269 over five years old, 15 (12.9%) and 19 (7.1%) were seropositive, respectively. The prevalence rates in Ardabil, East Azerbaijan, and West Azerbaijan were 11.7% (18 out of 154), 5.1% (7 out of 136), and 9.5% (9 out of 95), respectively. According to the statistical analysis, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection based on age, gender, or sampling location. This study is the first extensive report on the toxoplasmosis seroprevalence among horses in northwest Iran. The results provide important information that can help control and prevent the spread of toxoplasmosis. © 2024, Published by the University of Tabriz.

ABSTRACT: Horse users and caretakers must be aware of the risks of mixing social groups. The current study investigated whether eight equine practitioners can assess the social dominance rank of 20 horses. The horses’ feeding time and agonistic/aggressive and submissive behaviours were observed during the feed confrontation test, and the dominance index (DI) was calculated. Kendal’s W, Spearman correlations and factor analysis were applied to test the raters’ agreement, the relationship between dominance ranks and the behavioural variables, and to determine the clustered behaviours. The agreement between all raters in the classification of dominance order ranged from moderate to perfect. The ranking by every rater was strongly and negatively correlated with the time of eating in feed confrontation tests and with the DI, evidencing shorter feeding times for more submissive horses. The withdrawal of the horse when threatened was the behavioural variable that was most often correlated with raters’ ranking. The current study confirmed the abilities of practitioners to categorise the horses under their care according to their social interactions. Additionally, rolling when denied access to feed was proposed as frustration-releasing (redirected) behaviour. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of a fragmented, migrating acupuncture needle near the palmar proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) of a horse. ANIMAL A 9-year-old Warmblood cross mare. CLINICAL PRESENTATION, PROGRESSION, AND PROCEDURES The mare presented for evaluation of a linear metallic foreign body on the palmar lateral aspect of the PIPJ following acupuncture treatment. The mare had a pinpoint puncture wound and sensitivity to palpation over the lateral aspect of the PIPJ region. The referring veterinarian performed radiographs and found a linear metallic foreign body near the lateral palmar PIPJ. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated a hyperechoic lesion consistent with a metallic object in the soft tissues of the palmar lateral aspect of the PIPJ. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME The horse was anesthetized, and the linear metallic foreign body was removed. The use of intraoperative ultrasound and digital radiographs assisted in determining the location of and surgical approach to remove the foreign body. The linear metallic foreign body was the fragmented segment (body) of an acupuncture needle. The mare recovered from surgery uneventfully and returned to the previous level of activity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This report demonstrates the potential risks of prolonged retention and or delayed removal of acupuncture needles in the form of needle fragmentation and migration. It also demonstrates the use of imaging in determining the location and position of small, thin metallic foreign bodies to aid in surgical approach and removal. ©The authors.

ABSTRACT: Many studies have shown a strong correlation between Hindgut Acidosis (HGA) and the occurrence of laminitis in horses; therefore, the early diagnosis of HGA is essential. In this study, we investigated changes in the plasma concentrations of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) as inflammatory markers in horses with laminitis. Sixteen healthy male Arabian horses that had cecal cannulation without visible laminitis or general symptoms were randomly divided into two groups. The horses were fed two different diets in a forage-to-concentrate ratio. Blood samples were collected on Days 1, 10, and 20. The primary objective of this study was to analyze plasma levels of LBP and SAA. Cecal specimens were obtained from each equine subject on three designated days: days 1, 10, and 20. The second objective was to assess the levels of pH and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the samples. Throughout the study period, horses fed a high-concentrate diet exhibited a significantly elevated average lameness grade on days 10 and 20 compared to the initial stage (P < 0.001). On day 20, a significant increase in the concentration of SAA was observed in horses fed a high-concentrate diet, in contrast to the initial stage of the study. LBP levels in the plasma were significantly elevated on days 10 and 20 in horses fed a high-concentrate diet. Based on our findings, it is recommended that the evaluation of plasma LBP concentrations is more effective than SAA for the early identification of HGA in horses fed a high-grain diet. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Characterization of microbiota structure on the skin of healthy horses is important for further development of modulation strategies to ensure optimal bacterial composition for physiological processes. This requirement is also supported by the relatively high incidence of dermatological diseases in horses and thus the need to manage them therapeutically. The taxonomic analysis of skin samples (n = 30) from five different body parts of clinically healthy Shetlands ponies females (neck, back, abdomen, pastern, muzzle) kept under homogeneous conditions (in open stalls with paddock, feed with dry hay, green grass ad libitum and granulated feed) was performed using amplification of V3—V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results indicate that bacteria associated with healthy equine skin represent 18 phyla, 29 classes and 119 families. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (30.8 ± 9.1%) followed by Actinobacteriota (20.4 ± 7.6%), Firmicutes (19.5 ± 10.1%), Bacteroidota (8.5 ± 5.0%) and Deinococcota (7.2 ± 14.8%). Among 229 genera identified, Corynebacterium (7.4 ± 6.5%) was the most abundant genus in skin sites of horses, followed by Deinococcus (7.1 ± 14.9%) and Macrococcus (5.0 ± 8.2%). Indices for the richness and diversity of species within bacterial populations for five regions of horses skin revealed no significant variations observed for species richness (Chao1, p-value 0.2001) but significant result for species evenness (Shannon, p-value 0.0049) with maximum on the neck and minimum on the back skin site. The clustering was seen across samples from different skin sites but also across samples collected from individual horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Changes to the faecal microbiota of horses associated with administration of anthelmintic drugs is poorly defined. This study included horses with cyathostomin infection where susceptibility and resistance to oxfendazole and abamectin was known. This study assessed the changes to the faecal microbiota associated with administration of two different anthelmintics in this population. Twenty-four adult horses were included. Faecal egg counts were performed on all horses prior to random allocation into abamectin (n=8), oxfendazole (n=8) or Control groups (n=8) and at Day 14 post treatment. Faecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis prior to anthelmintic administration and on Day 3 and Day 14. From each faecal sample, DNA was extracted prior to PCR amplification, next generation sequencing and analysis using QIIME2. Anthelmintic treatment was associated with changes in alpha diversity (p <0.05), with increased evenness and diversity at Day 14 and increased richness at Day 3 within the abamectin group. Differences in relative abundance of bacteria at the phyla, family and genus taxonomic levels occurred after treatment; indicating that the microbiota was altered with anthelmintic administration. The results support that anthelmintic administration and removal of cyathostomins from the large intestine of horses is associated with changes in the faecal microbiota. The results suggest that removal of cyathostomins is associated with greater differences in microbiota, compared to anthelmintic drug administration that is ineffective in reducing cyathostomin infection. Cyathostomin removal was supported by adequate reduction of faecal egg counts, determined by faecal egg count reduction testing. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Among airborne biological contaminants, several pathogenic and/or allergenic fungi and bacteria can affect the health of horses and humans. Exposure to primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP) in the equine environment remains poorly understood, although environmental factors play a major role in the development of respiratory diseases and impaired performance in horses. This pilot study was conducted during a training course for young racers. Ambient and personal air samples provided original data on the microbial composition of PBAP in the riders’ immediate environment (stable, outdoor, riding arena), using culture-based and metagenomic approaches. The culture-based approach showed average levels of fungi and bacteria of 2.3 × 104 and 8.3 × 105 CFU/m3 respectively during training. Seventy-one and 50 fungal and bacterial species were respectively identified, while the metagenomic approach identified 211 and 285, respectively. It should be noted, however, that two-thirds of the bacterial and fungal genera were found by both approaches. Among these species, various pathogenic and/or allergenic fungi (Alternaria spp., Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp. and Lichtheimia ramosa) and bacteria (Aeromonas spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp.) were highlighted. This study underlines the value of the combined use of culture-based and metagenomic approaches to provide an overview of the distribution of different fungal and bacterial phyla, genera and species in the equine environment. Statistical analysis also suggests interactions between microbiological contaminants (bacteria and mold) and climatic parameters (rain, wind, temperature). © 2024 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control

ABSTRACT: Habituation indicates a decrement in response to a specific stimulus by repeated exposure to that stimulus. Responding to or ignoring sound stimuli, which are common background distractors, is important for the undisturbed functioning of the organism, efficient animal management and safe handling. We habituated 20 warmblood horses to a set of distracting sounds and assessed the possibility of reversing this process through simple modifications in sound playback. The study involved three stages: habituation (Stage 1) and two trials of dishabituation (Stage 2, 3). In Stage 1, five different sounds of animals, each on a separate day, were repeatedly (every 20 minutes (min)) played during a stay on an experimental paddock. The sounds were selected out of 40 sounds of different origin based on their distracting effect on the horses (e.g., interruption of previous activity, increase in emotional arousal) during the first exposure to them three months earlier. In Stage 2, four new and unknown sounds (futuristic characteristics) were additionally introduced to the set of habituated sounds, whereas in Stage 3, habituated sounds (from Stage 1) were played from an altered location. Behavioral (e.g., disruption of feeding, duration of feeding, locomotion and standing alert) and cardiac (heart rate and heart rate variability) variables were assessed. Generally, horses quickly habituated to the initially distracting sounds, but great variability was observed in the number of needed playbacks (1–7) for each horse. After completion of Stage 1, the horses responded with an increase in vigilance, locomotion, refeeding frequency and a 1-minute increase in mean heart rate to novel but not to known sounds. None of the modifications resulted in a recovery of previously habituated reactions. After introduction of playback modifications, only maximum heart rate (in Stage 2, Stage 3) and time of standing alert (in Stage 3) increased after re-exposure to sounds horses had been habituated to, suggesting some level of vigilance. However, this response was too weak to conclude about dishabituation. The results of the study confirm sound recognition and the fast and persistent audio habituation in horses. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Pain localised to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) region represents a frequent cause of lameness in sport horses, and standing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these regions is increasingly being acquired. This multicentre retrospective study describes the ranges of abnormalities identified on standing MRI of the MCP/MTP region and compares patterns of abnormalities between forelimbs, hindlimbs and different sports disciplines. In total, 341 MRI reports were reviewed. Subchondral bone plate irregularities, condylar and proximal phalanx pathologies were frequently identified with subchondral bone defect, sclerosis and increased intensity on STIR images often described. Medial pathology was frequently identified in the forelimbs, and more lateral pathology was reported in the hindlimbs, which could potentially reflect differences in the loading patterns. Significant differences in MRI findings were found between different sports activities, with MCP/MTP bone pathology occurring more frequently in MRI reports from race and endurance horses and MCP/MTP soft tissue injuries being reported more frequently in dressage and show-jumping horses, particularly in the suspensory apparatus, including the distal sesamoidean ligaments. The findings of this study identify patterns of MCP/MTP abnormalities detected using standing MRI, with differences seen between forelimbs and hindlimbs and between different sports disciplines. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have the potential to be incorporated into equine feed as a sustainable and nutritionally dense insect-derived source of protein and fat. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suitability of whole dried BSFL as a novel protein source in equine diets based on acceptability, palatability, and various health parameters. Seventeen horses (15.2 ± 7.0 years; 596 ± 122 kg body weight (BW) (mean±SD)) and three ponies (19.7 ± 0.6 years; 364 ± 53 kg) were separately fed a BSFL-based supplement (TRT) and a roasted soybean-based supplement (CON) (0.75 g crude protein per kg BW0.75) for 28-days using a cross-over study design. Feed intake was recorded throughout the feeding periods to assess the acceptability of the novel ingredient. Body weight, body condition score (BCS), plasma biochemistry, and complete blood counts were assessed at the beginning and end of each treatment period as markers of health status. After the cross-over study, two-bowl tests were used to assess the palatability of the BSFL supplement, with or without the presence of other concentrates. Minimal differences were observed between treatment groups for biochemical analytes and complete blood counts, and BW and BCS did not change throughout the study period. Both supplements were willingly consumed by the horses over the 28-day feeding periods, though feed intake was 8% greater in the CON compared to the TRT group (P<0.01). For the palatability tests, horses first approached (P=0.03) and first consumed (P=0.03) the CON more frequently than the TRT supplement when the supplements were supplied with other concentrates. When the supplements were offered in the absence of other concentrates, there was no difference in which bucket was approached first, but horses tended to first consume the CON rather than the TRT supplement. Overall, these data indicate that dietary consumption of BSFL for 28 days at a low-inclusion rate results in no negative health outcomes in horses; however, longer-term studies are warranted to further examine physiological effects of consuming BSFL and at higher inclusion rates. Though horses did favour the CON supplement based on palatability parameters, horses willingly consumed the BSFL supplement, indicating that BSFL at low inclusion rates may be considered a palatable ingredient in equine diets. © 2024

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of aging on phenylbutazone (PBZ) disposition in older horses (≥ 25 years old) compared to young adults (4 to 10 years old) by characterizing the pharmacokinetic profile of PBZ and its active metabolite, oxyphenbutazone (OPBZ), following a 2.2-mg/kg dose, IV. We hypothesized that the disposition of PBZ will be affected by age. ANIMALS 16 healthy horses (8 young adults aged 4 to 10 years and 8 geriatric horses ≥ 25 years old). METHODS Horses were administered a single 2.2-mg/kg PBZ dose, IV. Plasma samples were collected at designated time points and frozen at –80 °C until assayed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using Phoenix WinNonlin, version 8.0 (Certara). Both clinical and pharmacokinetic data were compared between age groups using independent samples t tests, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups, with the exception of age, weight, and plasma total solids. Plasma concentrations of PBZ were best described by a two-compartment model. The maximum plasma concentration of OPBZ was reached at 5 hours for both age groups, and the metabolite-to-parent-drug area-under-the-curve ratios were approximately 20% for both groups. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters of PBZ or its metabolite, OPBZ, differed significantly between age groups. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The hypothesis was rejected as there was no significant difference in PBZ disposition in young-adult horses compared to geriatric horses. Our data do not support the need for dose adjustments of PBZ in clinically healthy geriatric horses. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: There is limited data on current knowledge of Pennsylvania horse caretakers on tick-borne diseases (TBDs), tick identification, and tick management practices. This study aimed to determine tick knowledge, concern, and management among Pennsylvania equine caretakers using an online survey. Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA tests were used to analyze data. The survey received 894 responses (539 completed) from Pennsylvania equine owners and caretakers. The largest proportion of respondents cared for 3-5 horses (31 %), followed by 2 horses (27 %). Veterinarian-confirmed diagnosis rates of two TBDs, Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, were 38 % and 22 %, respectively. Most respondents (39 %) were moderately confident in recognizing Lyme disease, while most (44 %) were not confident at all in recognizing anaplasmosis. Most respondents (69 %) were either extremely or very concerned about their horses contracting any TBDs. Tick bite and TBD prevention methods used by equine caretakers included performing tick checks, using on-animal repellents, and conducting pasture/landscape management. Ten knowledge-based questions were asked, and the mean correct score was 3.97 ± 2.18 out of 10 possible points. There were significant positive associations between higher knowledge scores and previous veterinarian-confirmed equine Lyme disease diagnosis, higher concern level of TBDs, and higher frequency of tick checks. With increased equine TBD prevalence and high levels of horse owner concern about TBD, Extension educators should focus on teaching about TBDs and managing ticks on horses and farms. © 2024

ABSTRACT: An adult American Quarter Horse mare presented for pigmenturia and lethargy of 12 hours' duration and was diagnosed with silver maple leaf toxicity. The mare had intravascular hemolysis and azotemia. The mare was treated with a transfusion of whole blood, fluids administered IV, antibiotics, oxygen insufflation, and supportive care. The azotemia persisted despite conventional medical management and hemodialysis was elected. After 2 intermittent hemodialysis treatments over 3 days, the azotemia almost resolved, clinical signs improved, and the mare was discharged. The blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte concentrations remained normal 6 months later after examination by the referring veterinarian. Hemodialysis treatment can be feasible in horses if equipment and expertise are available and should be considered as a treatment option if indicated. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Habronemosis, also known as habronemiasis or habronematidosis, is a parasitic disease of equids caused by the larval stages of Habronematidae nematodes (Habronema muscae, Habronema microstoma, and Draschia megastoma) that are transmitted by muscid flies. The presence of aberrant infective larvae in the cutaneous and conjunctival tissues of these hosts results in granulomatous, exudative, and ulcerated lesions, also known as “summer sores.” In this study, we present a retrospective analysis of habronemosis cases in horses from the municipality of Lages, located on the Santa Catarina Plateau, a region with high altitudes and a temperate climate that differs from regions of Brazil where such parasitosis usually occurs. The equids were examined from 2008 to 2020 at the Veterinary Hospital of Santa Catarina State University. Sixteen patients were diagnosed and treated using macrocyclic lactones and wound cleaning. Most cases were recorded in autumn in horses (10/16, 62.5%) over 15 years of age (11/16, 68.8%), and the lesions were more frequently located in the conjunctiva (11/16, 68.8%). In scientific dissemination media, this is the first report of habronemosis on the Santa Catarina Plateau, Brazil. This information will contribute to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of skin diseases in horses in this region. © 2024, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In point-of-care diagnostics, the continuous monitoring of sweat constituents provides a window into individual's physiological state. For species like horses, with abundant sweat glands, sweat composition can serve as an early health indicator. Considering the salience of such metrics in the domain of high-value animal breeding, a sophisticated wearable sensor patch tailored is introduced for the dynamic assessment of equine sweat, offering insights into pH, potassium ion (K+), and temperature profiles during episodes of heat stress and under normal physiological conditions. The device integrates a laser-engraved graphene (LEG) sensing electrode array, a non-invasive iontophoretic module for stimulated sweat secretion, an adaptable signal processing unit, and an embedded wireless communication framework. Profiting from an admirable Truth Table capable of logical evaluation, the integrated system enabled the early and timely assessment for heat stress, with high accuracy, stability, and reproducibility. The sensor patch has been calibrated to align with the unique dermal and physiological contours of equine anatomy, thereby augmenting its applicability in practical settings. This real-time analysis tool for equine perspiration stands to revolutionize personalized health management approaches for high-value animals, marking a significant stride in the integration of smart technologies within the agricultural sector. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A 19-month-old female thoroughbred horse presented with a history of acute abdominal pain. When the horse was four months of age, she underwent abdominal surgery and most of the strangulated jejunum and ileum were resected and anastomosed using an end-to-end technique. Subsequently, the horse was diagnosed with an ileal obstruction secondary to an adhesion of the greater omentum, which caused a mechanical obstruction of the lumen of the distal ileum. The ileum was released by transecting the adhesion and performing an omentectomy. After surgical intervention, the horse recovered quickly and was discharged fifteen days after surgery. This case report describes an ileal obstruction caused by an omental adhesion that formed after a jejunoileal anastomosis in a thoroughbred horse. The clinical, imaging, and surgical findings are described. © 2024 University of Ljubljana Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Tabanidae are considered a nuisance to humans, wild animals, and livestock due to their painful, annoying, and insistent biting. Tabanids transmit some pathogens and parasites biologically and mechanically. In humans, there are relatively few pathogens transmitted regularly. Still, tabanids serve as vectors of a number of disease agents of animals, including viruses, bacteria, protozoans, and nematodes. They are more abundant in tropical and humid regions, and their seasonal patterns are affected by habitat changes such as deforestation and fragmentation. Here, we analyze the tabanid fauna in Monte Negro, a central municipality of Rondônia, Brazil, comparing abundance, richness, and diversity in forest and pasture habitats. Traps were set for 5 days a month for 12 consecutive months. We also examined how abiotic factors (humidity, temperature, and rainfall) affected the abundance, diversity, and richness and the effectiveness of Malaise and Nzi traps as sample methods. The influence of climatic variables on the richness and abundance of the species was tested using generalized linear models, and we used non-parametric dimensional scaling (nMDS) for analysis of species composition and diversity in different traps and environments. We collect 1032 specimens of 25 species. The most abundant species were Tabanus antarcticus, Dichelacera tetradelta, Tabanus mucronatus, and Leucotabanus albovarius. Forest habitats had the highest number of tabanids, followed by pasture and the anthropized area, and there was no significant difference regarding the effectiveness of the Malaise and Nzi traps. The study provides new information on the distribution and ecology of tabanids in Brazil. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To investigate potential equine clients’ perceptions of equine veterinarians based on attire. SAMPLE 763 horse owners/lessees. METHODS Participants were invited to complete a survey shared mainly via equestrian social media pages between August and October 2022.1–3 Survey participants were shown pictures of a male veterinarian and a female veterinarian in 7 outfits ranging from casual to business attire and were asked to score the veterinarian on 7 traits: easygoing attitude, friendliness, compassion, trustworthiness, professionalism, competence, and cost of services. The survey asked which of the traits were most valued in an equine veterinarian, as well as whether various aspects of appearance including tattoos, piercings, and hair dyed a nonorganic color were acceptable for equine veterinarians. RESULTS Of the 2,655 individuals who opened the survey, 763 responses were included. Respondents were predominantly female (743/763 [97.4%]) from rural areas (493/763 [64.6%]). Only 37.1% (283/763) of respondents agreed that what a veterinarian wears influences their confidence in them. The highest-ranked traits in an equine veterinarian were knowledge/competency (mean ± SD, 1.46 ± 0.98), followed by trustworthiness (2.34 ± 1.08) and compassion (3.50 ± 1.20), with coveralls and scrubs being the preferred attire clients associated with these attributes (with the exception of compassion, for which polo shirt/jeans was the preferred attire). T-shirt/jeans was consistently ranked lowest by respondents in association with these attributes, except in the area of compassion, where polo shirt/black pants was ranked lowest. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our findings suggested the attire and appearance of equine veterinarians can impact client perceptions, with veterinarians wearing scrubs and coveralls associated with higher competency and trustworthiness. © AVMA.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to investigate eye temperature modifications after road transport in athletic horses habituated to travel. Eight adult Italian saddle horses traveled 100 km and, two weeks later, 300 km. Eye temperature (ET), rectal temperature (RT) and serum cortisol concentration were assessed before (T1), after (T2) and 60 min (T3) after the road transport. ET was evaluated with infrared thermography (IRT) in three regions of interest: EL1 (medial canthus), EL2 (central cornea) and EL3 (lateral canthus). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures showed statistically higher values at T2 and T3 for EL1 (p < 0.01), EL2 (p < 0.01) and EL3 (p < 0.01) following the 100 km journey. RT (p < 0.01) showed higher values at T2 and T3 after the 100 km journey and higher values at T2 (p < 0.01) following the 300 km journey. ET values were positively correlated with RT at T1, T2 and T3 following the 100 km journey and at T2 following the 300 km journey and positively correlated with serum cortisol concentration at T1, T2 and T3 following the 100 km journey and at T2 and T3 following the 300 km journey. Eye temperature monitoring with IRT allows quick and practical strategies to monitor an animal’s physiological state and welfare during daily activities. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Poisonous plants are an integral part of many pastures destined for horses around the world. However, fundamental knowledge of the role of horses’ senses in discriminating these plants is still lacking. It is, therefore, of interest to study whether, besides sight, the olfaction used by animals before ingesting may prevent them eating a poisonous plant. The aim of the study was to determine whether stabled horses are capable of distinguishing poisonous plants solely by odour among the unfamiliar plants presented. Twenty adult warmblood mares and geldings were involved in the study. The novel plants presented for exploration by the horses were three poisonous species: Taxus baccata, Buxus sempervirens and Thuja occidentalis, as well as three non-poisonous species: Petroselinum crispum, Anethum graveolens and Eruca sativa. Each plant was presented in a small box for one minute on three days, two plants daily. The plants were unavailable to see or touch by the horses and only smell was perceptible. The horses were habituated and positively conditioned to approach the box. The intensity of exploration was measured by the number of exploration events, total exploration time and occurrence of additional behaviours, such as chewing. The method used made it possible to exclude other senses than smell and a previous experience with the plants tested from the analysis. The time of exploration in subsequent trials was found to be shortened (9.0, 5.5, 3.0 s for poisonous plants and 14.5, 7.0, 5.5 s for non-poisonous plants). The differences in the time spent exploring boxes with different plants show that horses discriminate new odours individually and undertake increased olfactory behaviours when encountering a novel odour. The horses spent significantly more time exploring non-poisonous than poisonous plants (7.0 and 5.0 s, respectively). They were also chewing and licking the crib notably more often when non-poisonous plants were presented compared to poisonous plants (0.24 and 0.13 versus 0.15 and 0.08, respectively). The shortened and weaker exploration in the case of poisonous plants may indicate that these plants caused a reluctance in the horses. Hence, our findings suggest that the horses’ sense of smell has some potential for differentiating poisonous from non-poisonous plants independently of the sense of taste, touch and sight. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A study comprising 74 colic and 74 control horses admitted to an animal hospital was performed. Faecal samples were collected and analysed for dry matter concentration, particle size distribution using wet-sieving, and sand presence through a sand sedimentation test. Data on horse breed, age, gender and basic feeding variables was collected and analysed using χ2-tests. Faecal dry matter concentration, particle size distribution and sand score was compared between colic and non-colic horses, and between horses with different colic types, using one-way ANOVA. Results showed that colic and non-colic horse groups were similar in breed, age, gender and basic feeding variables. Faecal dry matter concentration, particle size distribution and sand score were similar among colic and non-colic horses. Horses diagnosed with “unknown colic cause” had higher proportion of particles >0.5 <1.0 mm size compared to horses with colic due to impactions in caecum or colon, torsion or gas accumulation (P<0.05), but this difference was very small and most likely not of biological importance. Faecal dry matter concentration and sand score were similar among horses with different types of colic. Increased knowledge of the composition of particles of different size in equine faeces may enhance our understanding of digesta passage rate in colic and non-colic horses, which is needed to develop preventative measures of certain types of colic. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to validate methods of stool sample conservation for the egg hatch test (EHT). This study involved the use of a bovine naturally infected predominantly by Cooperia spp. and one equine naturally infected predominantly by cyathostomins characterized as susceptible to benzimidazoles in the EHT. Fecal samples were submitted to three treatments: aerobic methods (anaerobic storage in plastic bottles, anaerobic storage in vacuum-sealed bags or aerobic storage in plastic bags), under two temperature conditions (room temperature and refrigeration) analyzed at four different assessment times (48, 72, 96 and 120 h). As the standard test, an assay was also performed within 3 h. The tests were performed in triplicate for each drug concentration and with three experimental repetitions at one-week intervals. Two criteria were used for the storage methods: hatchability in the negative control group and sensitivity of the eggs to thiabendazole, comparing the EC50 and 95% confidence interval for each treatment to those of the standard test and the other repetitions. Bovine samples can be stored for up to 96 h and refrigerated vacuum storage can be used, ensuring hatchability of the negative control and sensitivity of the eggs to thiabendazole. For equine samples, no forms of storage were indicated due to the variation among the repetitions and the reduction in the sensitivity of the eggs to thiabendazole, which could result in a false positive detection of resistance. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: An intravitreal gentamicin injection (IVGI) was first described as an alternative treatment option for equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) in 2005. The aim of the present study is to determine the retention time of gentamicin in the vitreous of horses after an IVGI. Accordingly, an IVGI was performed on a total of 15 horses and vitreous samples were taken from 3 horses each after 0, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days and tested for their gentamicin concentration. The measurements showed that gentamicin can be detected in all horses sampled with concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration in the vitreous up to 10 days after an IVGI. After a sampling period of 14 days, only one of the three horses still showed a detectable concentration of gentamicin in the vitreous (2.87µg/ml). No gentamicin above the detection limit of 0.4µg/ ml could be measured in any of the three vitreous humours 21 days after an IVGI. Blood samples taken one hour after an IVGI from three healthy horses and three horses suffering from ERU showed no measurable gentamicin concentrations. Because of this, a systemic effect with potential nephro- and ototoxicity of gentamicin after an IVGI of 4mg can be neglected. A gentamicin concentration of 138.0-147.0µg/ml was measured in vitreous samples taken at the end of a vitrectomy in three additional horses. The measurements of three additional vitreous samples without a prior IVGI as a control group showed no evidence of gentamicin. Further research in this area is necessary in the future to clarify the long-lasting efficacy of gentamicin against recurrences of ERU with a relatively short retention time in the vitreous. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Retraining retired racehorses for various purposes can help correct behavioral issues. However, ensuring efficiency and preventing accidents present global challenges. Based on the hypothesis that a simple personality assessment could help address these challenges, the present study aimed to identify genetic markers associated with personality. Eight genes were selected from 18 personality-related candidate genes that are orthologs of human personality genes, and their association with personality was verified based on actual behavior. A total of 169 Thoroughbred horses were assessed for their tractability (questionnaire concerning tractability in 14 types of situations and 3 types of impressions) during the training process. Personality factors were extracted from the data using principal component analysis and analyzed for their association with single nucleotide variants as non-synonymous substitutions in the target genes. Three genes, CDH13, SLC6A4, and MAOA, demonstrated significant associations based on simple linear regression, marking the identification of these genes for the first time as contributors to temperament in Thoroughbred horses. All these genes, as well as the previously identified HTR1A, are involved in the serotonin neurotransmitter system, suggesting that the tractability of horses may be correlated with their social personality. Assessing the genotypes of these genes before retraining is expected to prevent problems in the development of a racehorse’s second career and shorten the training period through individual customization of training methods, thereby improving racehorse welfare. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to compare the digestibility of tropical grasses by horses by the in vivo method using mobile nylon bags with the in vitro digestibility method using horse feces as a source of inoculum. Five horses were used in a 2 × 5 factorial design with randomized blocks featuring two methods (in vivo and in vitro) and five grasses: Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.), sixweeks threeawn grass (Aristida adsencionis, Linn), Alexandergrass (Brachiaria plantaginea (Link) Hitchc.), capim-de-raiz (Chloris orthonoton, Doell), and Sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis). No difference (P>0.05) was found between the in vivo and in vitro methods regarding nutrient digestibility of Sabi grass and sixweeks threeawn. Tifton 85 was the only grass that showed differences (P<0.05) between the two methods concerning the apparent digestibility of all nutrients. Alexandergrass, Tifton 85, and capim-de-raiz exhibited the best digestibility of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and organic matter by the mobile bag method compared to the in vitro method. Tifton 85 and capim-de-raiz had higher crude protein digestibility by the mobile bag method than by the in vitro method. The mean retention time of the mobile bags in the digestive tract of the horses was 43.69 h. The bags with samples of sixweeks threeawn and Sabi grass had shorter retention times than capim-de-raiz and Alexandergrass (P<0.0001). It is concluded that, for sixweeks threeawn and Sabi grass, digestibility in horses can be assessed using the in vitro method in place of the mobile nylon bag method. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe, in detail, the relevant anatomy and surgical approach to access the paracondylar process (PCP) and report its application in a clinical case of headshaking. Animal: A seven-year-old, mixed breed mare. Study design: Experimental study/case report. Methods: A seven-year-old mixed breed mare was presented for investigation of acute onset progressing violent headshaking, resulting in the horse falling on multiple occasions. The horse was highly reactive to palpation over the right PCP. Standing computed tomographic (CT) investigation and ultrasonographic examination of the head detected a fracture of the right PCP. Five equine heads of mixed breeds and sizes were dissected to demonstrate the relevant anatomy surrounding the PCP with regard to surgical access. A modified hyovertebrotomy approach was used to remove the fracture fragment under general anesthesia. Results: The anatomy surrounding the PCP was described. The fragment was successfully removed resulting in gradual resolution of clinical signs. The horse recovered well postoperatively and was back into light levels of work with no signs of headshaking present two and a half years following surgery. Conclusion: The caudal meningeal artery and vein as well as the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves are adjacent to the PCP and must be avoided during dissections. The modified hyovertebrotomy approach allows safe surgical access to the PCP. Surgical excision of a PCP fragment can result in complete resolution of clinical signs of headshaking. Computed tomography and ultrasonography are valuable diagnostic tools to identify a fracture of the PCP. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Impaired oxygenation during anaesthesia can be detrimental. Bodyweight and body shape influence arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) but the effect of body condition score (BCS) has not been investigated. Objectives: To examine the effect of BCS on respiratory indices. Study design: Retrospective. Methods: In total, 524 anaesthetic records were reviewed. Records from healthy adult horses under isoflurane anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency, receiving controlled mechanical ventilation, with complete ventilation and arterial blood gas data and BCS assessment by one person (KL) were included in data analysis. Data were analysed using student's t-test, Mann–Whitney U test, chi-squared analysis and logistic regression. Results: In total, 135 records for 85 horses with BCS <6/9 (Group N) and 50 horses with BCS ≥6/9 (Group O) met the inclusion criteria. Overall, there was a strong negative correlation between BCS and PaO2 (Spearman's r = 0.72, p < 0.001). Group O had significantly lower PaO2 (112 [50–546 mmHg]) compared to Group N (380 [65–658 mmHg], p < 0.001) which remained when horses were further categorised by bodyweight >500 kg (118 mmHg vs. 390 mmHg, p < 0.001) and <500 kg (160 mmHg vs. 451 mmHg, p < 0.04). Group O were 34 times more likely to be hypoxaemic (PaO2 < 100 mmHg) compared to Group N (χ2 = 34.39, p = 0.03). Alveolar dead space fraction was greater in Group O (0.27 [0.10–0.41]) versus Group N (0.24 [0.12–0.35]), p < 0.001. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a significant association between PaO2 and bodyweight (p = 0.01), alveolar dead space fraction (p = 0.005) and BCS (p < 0.001). Main limitations: Retrospective design. Conclusions: Body condition score ≥6/9 has a detrimental effect on PaO2, alveolar dead space fraction and is a risk factor for hypoxaemia in healthy anaesthetised horses in dorsal recumbency. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine parvovirus hepatitis (EqPV-H) can cause Theiler's disease and subclinical hepatitis in horses. Objectives: Assess the frequency of subclinical EqPV-H infection in hospitalized horses and to study viral transmission by investigating potential shedding routes. Animals: One hundred sixteen equids, that presented to the University Equine Hospital of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna between February 2021 and March 2022, for causes other than hepatopathy. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, samples (serum, feces, nasal, and buccal swabs) of hospitalized horses were collected. Sera were screened for the presence of anti-EqPV-H antibodies by a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay. Quantitative PCR was used for the detection of EqPV-H DNA in the samples and a nested PCR was used for further validation. Results: Seroprevalence was 10.3% (12/116) and viremia occurred in 12.9% (15/116) of the serologically positive horses. The detected viral load in serum varied from non-quantifiable amount to 1.3 × 106 genome equivalents per milliliter of serum. A low viral load of EqPV-H DNA was detected in 2 nasal swabs and 1 fecal sample. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: EqPV-H DNA was detected in nasal secretions and feces of viremic horses, which could pose a risk to naive hospitalized horses. It is advisable to screen hospitalized horses that are potential donors of blood or plasma to reduce the risk of iatrogenic EqPV-H transmission. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to describe the current state of genetic variability in the Haflinger breed in the Czech Republic using microsatellite markers, taking into consideration the numerous imports of breeding animals from abroad during the last 20 years and their impact on genetic diversity and population structure. A total of 443 horses from five countries of origin (Austria-AUT, Germany-GER, Czech Republic-CZE, Italy-ITA, and Slovakia-SVK) bred in the Czech Republic were included in the study. A set of 16 microsatellite markers for parentage control from the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG) was used for genotyping. The total number of alleles in individual subpopulations ranged from 53 (SVK) to 117 (CZE). The mean number of alleles per locus was 6.69. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) values ranged from 0.69 to 0.71 in all subpopulations. The most variable and informative locus (in terms of polymorphic information content-PIC) was VHL20, and the least variable was HTG6. The Fis index was mostly negative or close to 0 for all populations and was-0.033 for the whole population. The overall Fst was 0.010, indicating a low level of differentiation between subpopulations. Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord genetic distances were low between the CZE, AUT, and GER populations, while the ITA and SVK populations were more distinct. The results of the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) and the STRUCTURE analysis indicated a high degree of admixture among subpopulations. However, three to four genetic groups were clustered. The most distant populations were ITA and SVK, which we attribute to the low number of representatives in these subpopulations. A higher level of admixture due to gene flow was observed between the populations of GER, CZE, and AUT. Higher admixtures and the discovery of more distinct genetic clusters suggest that there is more significant gene flow from the countries of origin in the population of the Haflinger breed in the Czech Republic and that there is sufficient genetic variability and diversity to suggest sufficient opportunities for more intensive breeding.  © 2024 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The horse (Equus caballus) varieties from Skyros and Rhodes islands (Greece) in the Aegean archipelago are extremely small, reaching shoulder heights of only about 1 m. Furthermore, the Japanese archipelago is home to eight small, native horse breeds. We investigated the evolutionary morphology and provided a review of historical documentations of these horses of cultural interest in Greece and Japan, thus providing a comparison of the independent evolution of small size in islands. We integrate cranial data from historical literature with data from newly gathered and curated skulls and analyse a measurement dataset featuring various domestic and mainland horse breeds and varieties. We use non-invasive imaging to study and measure 3D models of the bony labyrinth, housing the inner ear, and the braincase endocast. When considering the effects of allometry by regressing each PC1 scores (for each set of measurements) with the cranial geometric mean from linear measurements as a body size proxy, we show that size explains a large amount of the shape variation in horse crania, the bony labyrinths and brain endocasts. We found high intrabreed variation in all the analysed datasets. Globally, there are at least 30 distinct horse populations on islands, offering the chance to further study processes of convergence in morphological divergence and evaluate the effect of drift and the environment. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Enteroliths are mineralized concretions found in the large intestines of horses that can cause impaction colic by impeding normal enteric flow, typically at points of reduced intestinal diameter. They are highly prevalent and significantly detrimental in the equestrian environment. A presumptive diagnosis is based on the history and clinical signs, while a definitive diagnosis is possible only through exploratory laparotomy or abdominal radiography. This study aimed to determine the clinical applicability of established parameters for performing radiographic diagnoses in cases of equine enterolithiasis and to compare these findings between a group with enterolithiasis and a control group. The medical records of 92 horses treated for colic syndrome between June 2022 and October 2023 were retrospectively evaluated. This included 32 animals presenting with clinical signs of impaction colic originating from the large intestine or with a history of recurrent abdominal pain, all of whom underwent abdominal radiography and for whom definitive diagnosis was achieved through laparotomy. The study groups comprised 12 control animals and 20 in the enterolithiasis group. The study investigated the influence of the size, number, and location of enteroliths on radiographic detection, in addition to identifying factors that hindered the performance of the diagnostic technique and its correlation with surgical findings. During the study, 85.5% of the animals in the enterolithiasis group (17/20) were pre-surgically diagnosed with enterolith through abdominal radiography, while three animals presented false-negative results and were diagnosed through exploratory laparotomy. The number of concretions showed significant statistical relevance. The main factors that interfered with the radiographic diagnosis were abdominal distension, weight, and body condition score. These findings indicate that this diagnostic method, regardless of the obstructed segment and the number of enteroliths, is easier to apply when more than one concretion is present. The study demonstrated that abdominal digital radiography is an important auxiliary method for pre-surgical diagnosis in cases of equine enterolithiasis. The feasibility of this diagnostic method was found not to depend on the obstructed segment or the number of enteroliths, which are more easily observed in animals with more than one concretion. However, caution is advised when interpreting images of obese horses or those with abdominal distension due to gas, as these conditions have led to false-negative diagnoses. This research highlights the importance of abdominal radiography in managing enterolith cases for timely therapeutic intervention and improved prognosis. © 2024 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report the long-term survival of adult horses that were subjected to synovial lavage for treatment of contaminated and septic synovial structures. Study design: Multicenter, prospective observational trial. Animals: Horses (n = 240) presented for synovial sepsis at 10 UK referral centers. Methods: Data for horses presented for treatment of synovial sepsis were collected over a 15 month recruitment period. Owners were contacted a minimum of 365 days after surgery using a structured client interview to assess long term survival. Descriptive statistics, and univariable and Cox proportional hazards models for postoperative survival time were developed. Results: Survival to discharge was 228/240 (95%) and overall long-term survival was 89.4% (185/207). Unknown cause of injury (p =.017), increasing duration of surgery (p =.003), increasing weight (p =.008), forelimb injuries (p =.027), and type of synovial structure (p =.008) were found to be associated with death using Cox proportional hazards models. Conclusion: This study provides information on risk factors associated with survival and death after treatment for synovial sepsis at referral hospitals in the UK. Survival to discharge and long-term survival was excellent. Heavier horses, injuries affecting the forelimbs, tendon sheaths and bursae were associated with poorer long term outcomes. Longer duration of surgery was also found to be associated with a worse prognosis. Clinical significance: These findings help to provide prognostic information for owners and veterinarians treating horses with synovial sepsis. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: This report describes a 2-year-old Quarter Horse filly that was diagnosed with concurrent Streptococcus equi subsp. equi infection, purpura haemorrhagica, and immune-mediated myositis. The filly was presented for evaluation of fever of unknown origin, rapid weight loss and inappetence after exposure to strangles that was initially unknown. Over the course of hospitalisation the filly developed mandibular lymphadenopathy, guttural pouch empyema, and mucosal petechiation and ecchymoses. The presence of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi was confirmed via PCR and culture of a lymph node aspirate and biopsies of the skin confirmed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, consistent with purpura haemorrhagica. Genetic testing confirmed that the filly had one copy of the MYH1 mutation (N/My). Following therapy with systemic corticosteroids, plasma transfusion and antimicrobial therapy the filly improved and was discharged. Communication with the owner 11 months later confirmed that filly appeared healthy but remained poorly muscled. This report is the first to the authors' knowledge describing concurrent Streptococcus equi subsp. equi infection, purpura haemorrhagica, and immune-mediated myositis. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses have been an integral part of Bangladesh’s cultural and economic landscape for a long time and serve diverse roles. This study aims to characterize the phenotypic traits of native horses and investigate the management practices and socioeconomic status of horse owners. A total of 233 horse-rearing households were interviewed by structured questionnaire from selective locations covering all divisions of Bangladesh. Phenotypic traits (Body weight, body length, chest girth, neck length, head length, ear length, wither height, back height, length from ear to tail, mane length, tail length) and reproductive features (Age of 1st heat and conception, foaling interval, gestation length and estrous length) were recorded for phenotypic characterization (n=240). Half of the farmers (53.20%) possess a basic level of education and agriculture is the main occupation (43.30%) followed by business. Horses are reared for income generation (77.3%) and farmers prefer stallions (43.65%) over geldings for rearing. A semi-intensive rearing system is identified where farmers provide a combination of roughage and concentrate feed. Bloat, diarrhea, colds, fevers and skin diseases are common among others. Mares experience first heat at 24.02±2.61 months and conceive at 27.09±3.64 months. Foaling length, gestation interval and estrous length were recorded as 26.98±3.14 months, 11.58±0.46 months and 21.25±0.75 days respectively. Chestnut and bay are the predominant coat colors among others. Male horses have higher (p<0.05) body length, neck length, head length, wither height, back height, ear-to-tail length and mane length than female horses. Bangladesh has no horse breed, and indigenous horses are smaller in size with homogeneity of reproductive and phenotypic features. Genetic characterization is recommended to identify the origin of indigenous and crossbreeds including samples from nationwide. © 2024 by the authors. Licensee ResearchersLinks Ltd, England, UK.

ABSTRACT: With the increasing awareness of the “united airway disease” theory, more horses, not only sport horses but also pleasure horses, undergo detailed examinations of the respiratory tract. Using endoscopy, equine asthma (EA) is most commonly diagnosed in the lower airway, while pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) is common in the upper airway. Grading EA as mild–moderate (MEA) and severe (SEA), this study aims to compare the co-occurrence and investigate the possible relationship between the clinical symptoms and endoscopic signs of MEA/SEA and PLH in pleasure horses. In this retrospective study, 80 out of 93 pleasure horses suspected of EA were enrolled and underwent a standardized protocol for a complete airway examination, including resting endoscopy with mucus accumulation assessment and cytology. The obtained results were scored and analyzed. In the studied pleasure horses, PLH co-occurred more frequently in horses with EA than without (p < 0.0001) and more in horses with SEA than with MEA (p = 0.025). However, when EA and PLH co-occurred, the severity of the clinical symptoms of EA did not increase (p > 0.05). In both EA and PLH, the amount of tracheal and nasopharyngeal mucus increased with the severity of the disease; however, it was positively correlated (ρ = 0.33; p = 0.02) only in SEA horses. In conclusion, it is likely that EA is often accompanied by PLH; however, PLH did not play a role in increasing the severity of EA’s clinical symptoms. The role of the severity of accumulated mucus in the lower and upper airways when EA/PLH co-occur requires further research to confirm the morphological and functional unity of the respiratory tract, aligning with the concept of “united airways disease”. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The article presents the results of a study on the development of technology for obtaining and studying the physicochemical characteristics of melanin isolated from the seed shells of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), growing in the territory of Tashkent. A technological scheme for the production of melanin has been developed, which includes the stages of grinding the raw material (shell), the use of ultrasound in an ethyl alcohol environment, extraction, 3 times acidification with a solution of hydrochloric acid, filtration, concentration, dissolution in an alkali solution, precipitation, purification with ethyl acetate, dialysis, and melanin drying. The influence of the raw material-extractant ratio, multiplicity, and duration of extraction on the yield of melanin was studied and the optimal conditions for melanin isolation were determined. Melanin obtained from the shells of horse chestnut seeds is a brown powder, the yield was 24.5% by weight of dry raw materials. Analysis of the elemental composition showed: that the nitrogen content in the isolated melanin molecule is 0.7%, the amount of carbon is 44%, and hydrogen is 6%. IR spectral analysis of the melanin content in the shells of horse chestnut seeds showed the presence of absorption bands that correspond to melanin.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

ABSTRACT: Objective of the study was to describe two different cases of equine infective endocarditis and to emphasis the challenges which occur in diagnostic work-up, therapeutic options and outcome of this rare and often fatal disease. Both cases had a history of recurrent fever, apathy, and a recently developed heart murmur. Both horses were unresponsive to pre-treatment with antibiotics and antiphlogistics. At admission, the horse with infective aortic endocarditis presented various unspecific clinical signs and was subjected to several complementary examinations that were required for definite diagnosis. Despite antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment, the horse developed ataxia and obtundation. Change of the antibiotic treatment regimen did not stop the horse's condition worsening, resulting in euthanasia 11 days after admission to the hospital. Post-mortem examination confirmed diagnosis of infective endocarditis and inflammation of several extracardiac organs likely due to embolism. Actinobacillus equuli monoculture was identified from aortic valve tissue which was sensitive to all applied antibiotics. The second horse was diagnosed with infective tricuspid valve endocarditis at an early disease stage during a routine vaccination vet check. It responded well to antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment during hospitalization. Serial follow-up examinations including exercise tests and echocardiography were performed up to 18 months after discharge from the clinic and confirmed cure of infection with persistence of tricuspid valve regurgitation allowing the horse to gradually return to training. The two cases emphasise the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis which are often time consuming and expensive in line with a poor prognosis. However, cure of infection and resolving of clinical symptoms are possible, although rare. The key factor for successful management is an early definite diagnosis which requires the equine practitioners' awareness for this disease. Outcome and prognosis are also highly dependent on anatomical structures affected. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Polo Argentino (PA) horse is a recognized breed, developed originally by mixing crossbred and Thoroughbred (TB) horses to play polo. Early PA selection is difficult due to unreliable performance estimations. This study investigated the usefulness of genomic markers previously linked to morphological and functional traits as a tool for the early selection of PA. To this, we genotyped 520 PA and 30 TB horses using the Equine GGPArray (Illumina, n = 71,778 SNPs). Analyses included a genetic characterization of six genetic markers associated with behavioral (DRD4), muscular development (MSTN), and body size (LCORL, HMGA6, ZFAT, and LASP1) genes. Genetic differences in the DRD4, MSTN, and LCORL SNP were found between the two breeds, in the last two FST index between breeds was 0.13 and 0.6, respectively (p < 0.01). In DRD4, G allele was the more prevalent in PA (0.56 vs 0.45 in TB, p < 0.05), but no differences were observed between the genotypes associated with phenotypes. In MSTN, heterozygous genotypes were the most common in PA (48 %), with a significant decrease in AA (Hardy-Weinberg p < 0.05), suggesting a negative selection against it in polo horses. In body size, HMGA2 was monomorphic in all horses, while ZFAT and LASP1 SNP showed higher variability. Interestingly, 99 % of PA showed a TT genotype in LCORL (only 66 % in TB), demonstrating selection for smaller horses. Our results suggest that empirical selection in PA has generated an incipient genomic differentiation in discrete traits which could be used as a marker-assisted selection tool for early selection of polo horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: This study analyzed ancient DNA from the remains of horses unearthed from the Shihuyao tombs. These were found to date from the Han and Tang Dynasties in Xinjiang (approximately 2200 to 1100 years ago). Two high-quality mitochondrial genomes were acquired and analyzed using next-generation sequencing. The genomes were split into two maternal haplogroups, B and D, according to a study that included ancient and contemporary samples from Eurasia. A close genetic affinity was observed between the horse of the Tang Dynasty and Akhal-Teke horses according to the primitive horse haplotype G1. Historical evidence suggests that the ancient Silk Road had a vital role in their dissemination. Additionally, the matrilineal history of the Akhal-Teke horse was accessed and suggested that the early domestication of the breed was for military purposes. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Arabian horse has been identified as carrying a risk locus for equine metabolic syndrome, predisposing this breed to development of laminitis. Radigraphy of the equine foot is widely considered the main diagnostic imaging technique for evaluation of the laminitic horse. Knowledge of ‘normal’ breed values allows assessment of the degree and severity of radiological changes associated with laminitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the normal values for radiological measurements of the feet of the Straight Egyptian Arabian horse in Qatar. The design was a clinical prospective study. Radiographs of the fore and hind feet of 10 clinically normal adult Straight Egyptian Arabian horses were taken. On the lateromedial views, 17 measurements were taken (13 distances and four angles). On the horizontal dorsopalmar/plantar views, two measurements were taken. On the dorsal 45 degree, proximo-palmarodistal oblique projections, four measurements were taken. Normal reference ranges were reported for radiological measurements of the feet of the Straight Egyptian Arabian horse. Several variables showed significant differences between fore and hind feet, including hoof angle, distal wall thickness, and two proximal inner layer measurements (p < 0.05). In addition, the Straight Egyptian Arabian horse was found to have a number of measurements which varied from previously published reports. The results reported within provide a useful reference for normal radiographic measurements of the Straight Egyptian Arabian horse with relevance for laminitis. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The use of surface electromyography in the field of animal locomotion has increased considerably over the past decade. However, no consensus exists on the methodology for data collection in horses. This study aimed to start the development of recommendations for bipolar electrode locations to collect surface electromyographic data from horses during dynamic tasks. Data were collected from 21 superficial muscles of three horses during trot on a treadmill using linear electrode arrays. The data were assessed both quantitatively (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and coefficient of variation (CoV)) and qualitatively (presence of crosstalk and activation patterns) to compare and select electrode locations for each muscle. For most muscles and horses, the highest SNR values were detected near or cranial/proximal to the central region of the muscle. Concerning the CoV, there were larger differences between muscles and horses than within muscles. Qualitatively, crosstalk was suspected to be present in the signals of twelve muscles but not in all locations in the arrays. With this study, a first attempt is made to develop recommendations for bipolar electrode locations for muscle activity measurements during dynamic contractions in horses. The results may help to improve the reliability and reproducibility of study results in equine biomechanics. © 2024

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate if a difference in synovial amikacin concentrations exists in the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) following different durations of instillation of an IV regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) perfusate. ANIMALS 7 healthy horses. METHODS Horses received 2 IVRLPs with 2 g amikacin diluted to 60 mL with 0.9% NaCl via the cephalic vein in a crossover study design with a wash-out period between procedures. Instillation of the perfusate was administered over a 1-minute (technique 1) and 5-minute (technique 5) period. Concentrations of amikacin within the RCJ were measured at time (T) 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after instillation of the perfusate. Systemic concentrations of amikacin were measured at T0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 29 minutes, and 1 minute after tourniquet removal (T31). Amikacin concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. RESULTS The median maximum concentration (CMAX) of amikacin within the RCJ for technique 1 was 338.4 µg/mL (range, 60 to 4,925 µg/mL), while the median CMAX for technique 5 was higher at 694.8 µg/mL (range, 169.2 to 3,410 µg/mL; P =.398). There was a higher amikacin blood concentration over time for technique 1 compared to technique 5 (P =.004). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Administration of perfusate at different rates did not significantly affect synovial concentration of amikacin within the RCJ when performing IVRLP. However, increased systemic leakage was noted when the perfusate was administered over 1 minute, which might affect synovial concentrations in a larger group of horses. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: The aim of this study was to compare ultrasonographic findings of the ventral midline incision after exploratory laparotomy for colic in horses with and without surgical site infection (SSI). Methods: Ultrasonographic examination of the surgical wound was performed on postoperative day 5 (D5) and day 10 (D10) to assess the presence of fluid accumulation, suture sinus formation, hyperechogenic spots and fistulous path. Clinical evaluation of the wound was used to classify horses with and without SSI. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the ultrasonographic findings were then calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed with SSI as a dependent variable and age, sex, breed and ultrasonographic findings as independent variables after univariate and collinearity analyses. Results: Twenty-nine of the 84 horses examined had an SSI. Detection of fluid accumulation and hyperechogenic spots increased the odds for SSI at D5 (odds ratio [OR]: 4.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53–16.33, p = 0.008; OR: 10.78, 95% CI: 1.75–26.59, p = 0.01, respectively) and D10 (OR: 11.51, 95% CI: 2.39–55.47, p = 0.002; OR: 12.34, 95% CI: 3.45–44.15, p < 0.001, respectively). Limitation: Ultrasonographic images were taken only on the longitudinal section. Conclusion: Ultrasonographic examination is helpful in evaluating the surgical incision after laparotomy, with the detection of fluid accumulation and hyperechogenic spots surrounding the sutures being strongly related to SSI. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Urticaria, independent of or associated with allergies, is commonly seen in horses and often shows a high reoccurrence rate. Managing these horses is discouraging, and efficient treatment options are lacking. Due to an incidental finding in a study on horses affected by insect bite hypersensitivity using the eosinophil-targeting eIL-5-CuMV-TT vaccine, we observed the prevention of reoccurring seasonal urticaria in four subsequent years with re-vaccination. In an exploratory case series of horses affected with non-seasonal urticaria, we aimed to investigate the role of eosinophils in urticaria. Skin punch biopsies for histology and qPCR of eosinophil associated genes were performed. Further, two severe, non-seasonal, recurrent urticaria-affected horses were vaccinated using eIL-5-CuMV-TT, and urticaria flare-up was followed up with re-vaccination for several years. Eotaxin-2, eotaxin-3, IL-5, CCR5, and CXCL10 showed high sensitivity and specificity for urticarial lesions, while eosinophils were present in 50% of histological tissue sections. The eIL-5-CuMV-TT vaccine reduced eosinophil counts in blood, cleared clinical signs of urticaria, and even prevented new episodes of urticaria in horses with non-seasonal recurrent urticaria. This indicates that eosinophils play a leading role in urticaria in horses, and targeting eosinophils offers an attractive new treatment option, replacing the use of corticosteroids. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aimed to examine the species diversity and structure of the strongylid community in domestic horses in Eastern Slovakia. Also, an analysis of the impact of age, sex, and collection location factors on the strongyid communities was performed. Methods: Twenty-seven horses 1.5–21 years old from two farms in eastern Slovakia with different horse-management conditions were studied. Strongylids were collected after horse treatments with Noromectin (0.2 mg ivermectin); 66,170 specimens were collected and identified. Faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was performed following fenbendazole (FBZ) and ivermectin (IVM) treatments. Results: Twenty-four strongylid species were found; horses were infected with 6 to 16 (average = 11.7) species. Six cyathostomin species (Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cyathostomum catinatum, C. pateratum, Cylicostephanus longibursatus, C. goldi, C. calicatus) were the most prevalent; C. catinatum was the dominant species in both farms (Berger-Parker index 0.34 and 0.42). The structure of the strongylid community was multimodal with dominant, subdominant, background, and rare species. The Mantel test showed that horse age and sex did not significantly affect the nematode infracommunity composition (p > 0.05), while the impact of the collection location (farm) was significant (p = 0.03). Additionally, C. longibursatus was identified as the species contributing significantly to the observed farm differences. Strong resistance to FBZ was documented on both farms (FECRT was 36.4% and 22.7%); IVM resistance was not observed (FECRT = 100%). Conclusion: This study presents the first report on the strongylids parasitizing domestic horses in Eastern Slovakia and gives basic information for further studies of horse parasites and their control in the region. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nitrogen (three doses of N) and magnesium (two doses of Mg) fertilization on the yield and quality of fodder obtained from two old and extensive grass species Festulolium braunii cv. ‘Felopa’ and Lolium multiflorum cv. ‘Tur’ in field cultivation under dry conditions. F. braunii was better adapted to cultivation on light, dry soils than L. multiflorum; in such conditions, it produces higher yields of dry matter and protein, characterized by a higher concentration of nutrients. F. braunii fertilized with doses of 120 and 180 kg N∙ha−1 yielded higher than that fertilized with a dose of 60 kg N∙ha−1, and L. multiflorum produced similar yields after applying doses of 60, 120 and 180 kg N∙ha−1. For tested grass pasture, a single N application after the start of vegetation in two forms (fast- and slow-acting) appears to be adequate. Resignation from splitting the nitrogen dose due to variable rainfall distribution that can occur after the first cut during the dry summer is beneficial due to a reduction in the losses of nutrients and environmental burdens. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study compares the performance of Transformers with LSTM for the classification of the behavioural time budget in horses based on video data. The behavioural time budget of a horse consists of amount of time of the activities such as feeding, resting, lying, and moving, which are important indicators of welfare and can be a basis of pain detection. Video technology offers a non-invasive and continuous monitoring approach for automated detection of horse behaviours. Computer vision and deep learning methods have been used for automated monitoring of animal behaviours, but accurate behaviour recognition remains a challenge. Previous studies have employed Convolutional LSTM models for behaviour classification, and more recently, Transformer-based models have shown superior performance in various tasks. This study proposes a multi-input, multi-output classification methodology to address the challenges of accurately detecting and classifying horse behaviours. The results demonstrate that the multi-input and multi-output Transformer model achieves the best performance in behaviour classification compared with single input and single output strategy. The proposed methodology provides a basis for detecting changes in behaviour time budgets related to pain and discomfort in horses, which can be valuable for monitoring and treating horse health problems. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Seed maturation is genetically controlled process involves a series of morphological and physiological changes extending from fertilization to independence from the mother plant. Horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum Lam.) is an under exploited legume and it is an inexpensive source of protein, rich in minerals and vitamins. However, information on harvesting time of horse gram seeds are still limited. Therefore, this study was carried out in horse gram to determine the physiological maturity in obtaining good quality of seeds for better planting value. Methods: The laboratory experiment was carried out at Department of Seed Science and Technology, Agricultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Madurai, India to determine the appropriate time of harvesting horse gram var. Paiyur 2 seeds. The crop was raised as bulk in the field during rabi season of 2019 and the pods were harvested in interval of seven days from 7 days after anthesis (DAA) to 56 DAA and subjected for determinations of pod and seed characteristics. Result: The result revealed that, pod length and pod fresh weight of seeds showed a steady increase upto 35 DAA showed maximum pod length (4.76 cm) and fresh weight of pods (6.903 g/10 pods). The seeds attained maximum germination (94%), dry weight (0.859 g/25 seeds) and vigour parameters viz., root length (17.7 cm), shoot length (8.8 cm), dry matter production (0.161 g/10 seedlings), vigour index I (2491) and vigour index II (15) on 49 DAA. © 2024, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: Background: Recent advancements in molecular diagnostics have unveiled a multitude of allergen molecules (AMs) associated with animal sensitizations, revealing significant cross- and co-sensitization patterns among these seemingly distinct allergens. Method: We investigated the sensitization profiles of 120 children, sensitized to at least one of the 14 AMs from cat, dog, or horse using the Alex test, employing correlations and hierarchical clusters to explore relationship between sensitizations. Results: Sensitizations to Fel d 1, Can f 4/5, and Equ c 4 differ from other cat, dog, and horse AM sensitizations, suggesting they may represent genuine sensitizations for their respective animals. High correlations were observed among various AMs, including lipocalins (Can f 1/2/6, Fel d 4/7, and Equ c 1), serum albumins (Fel d 2, Can f 3, and Equ c 3), and uteroglobins (Fel d 1 and Can f_Fd1). Hierarchical clustering of sensitizations identified two similarity clusters and one dissimilarity cluster, providing an estimation of the likelihood of cross-reactivity. Additionally, our method facilitated speculation regarding cross-, co-, or genuine sensitization. Moreover, we noted a potential increase in the number and level of sensitized animal AMs concurrent with increased sensitization to other aeroallergens with advancing age. No significant difference was detected for the presence or absence of various types of allergic comorbidities. Conclusion: Correlations and hierarchical clustering can unveil the extent and magnitude of cross-, co-, and genuine sensitization relationships among animal AMs. These insights can be leveraged to enhance artificial intelligence algorithms, improving diagnostic accuracy through the integration of other measures of sensitization. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to investigate differences in testicular tissue morphology, gene expression, and marker genes between sexually immature (1-year-old) and sexually mature (10-year-old) Mongolian horses. The purposes of our research were to provide insights into the reproductive physiology of male Mongolian horses and to identify potential markers for sexual maturity. The methods we applied included the transcriptomic profiling of testicular cells using single-cell sequencing techniques. Our results revealed significant differences in tissue morphology and gene expression patterns between the two age groups. Specifically, 25 cell clusters and 10 cell types were identified, including spermatogonial and somatic cells. Differential gene expression analysis highlighted distinct patterns related to cellular infrastructure in sexually immature horses and spermatogenesis in sexually mature horses. Marker genes specific to each stage were also identified, including APOA1, AMH, TAC3, INHA, SPARC, and SOX9 for the sexually immature stage, and PRM1, PRM2, LOC100051500, PRSS37, HMGB4, and H1-9 for the sexually mature stage. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of testicular development and spermatogenesis in Mongolian horses and have potential applications in equine reproductive biology and breeding programs. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual maturity in Mongolian horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness is a severe and often fatal disease affecting all species of equids. The aetiological agent, African horse sickness virus (AHSV), can be differentiated into nine serotypes. The identification of AHSV serotypes is vital for disease management, as this can influence vaccine selection and help trace disease incursion routes. In this study, we report the development and optimisation of a novel, molecular-based assay that utilises multiplex PCR and microsphere-based technology to expedite detection and differentiation of multiple AHSV serotypes in one assay. We demonstrated the ability of this assay to identify all nine AHSV serotypes, with detection limits ranging from 1 to 277 genome copies/µL depending on the AHSV serotype. An evaluation of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity revealed a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%. This method can serotype up to 42 samples per run and can be completed in approximately 4–6 h. It provides a powerful tool to enhance the rapidity and efficiency of AHSV serotype detection, thereby facilitating the generation of epidemiological data that can help understand and control the incidence of AHSV worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This report describes a rare case of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) in a 12-year-old Quarter Horse gelding, caused by lymphocytic myenteric ganglionitis (MG) associated with equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) infection. The horse presented with recurrent colic and weight loss over 1.5 years. Repetitive transrectal examinations consistently revealed small colon impaction and enlargement. During postmortem examination alternating segments of enlarged and reduced luminal diameter were observed throughout the entire intestinal tract. MG with lymphocytic infiltrates and neuronal degeneration of the large intestine were found on histopathological analysis. Additionally, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed the presence of EHV-1 and EHV-5 DNA in affected intestinal tissues. Further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of MG and its association with herpesviruses. Early recognition and diagnosis of MG-associated CIPO may improve treatment approaches and outcomes for future cases. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by different cell infiltrates in the intestine. The aims of this study were to report the clinical and clinicopathological findings in horses with histological changes compatible with IBD in the duodenum. Further, the clinical progression of IBD and survival were investigated. Patient records were reviewed for horses in which histological evidence of IBD was found in duodenal biopsies collected during endoscopy. The histological changes were classified as mild, moderate or severe and the predominant infiltrating cell type was recorded. Clinical improvement was assessed by the owner via a questionnaire at 6 weeks after biopsy, along with survival after one year. In total, 149 horses were included, and the most common clinical signs were weight loss, reduced performance and pain during abdominal palpation. Most horses showed partial malabsorption during an oral glucose absorption test, and the horses with severe IBD had lower serum protein concentrations. Lymphoplasmacytic enteritis was the most common type of IBD (78.5% of cases), while in six horses neutrophilic infiltration of the duodenum was present. Overall, 71% of the cases had improved clinically after six weeks, mostly following treatment with corticosteroids. The results of a second biopsy were a poor predictor of improvement, and the horses that improved after 6 weeks were more likely to be alive after one year. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Reports of newly discovered equine hepatotropic flavi- and parvoviruses have emerged throughout the last decade in many countries, the discovery of which has stimulated a great deal of interest and clinical research. Although commonly detected in horses without signs of disease, equine parvovirus hepatitis (EqPV-H) and equine hepacivirus (EqHV) have been associated with liver disease, including following the administration of contaminated anti-toxin. Our aim was to determine whether EqPV-H and EqHV are present in Australian horses and whether EqPV-H was present in French horses and to examine sequence diversity between strains of both viruses amongst infected horses on either side of the globe. Sera from 188 Australian horses and 256 French horses from horses with and without clinical signs of disease were collected. Twelve out of 256 (4.7%) and 6 out of 188 (3.2%) French and Australian horses, respectively, were positive for the molecular detection of EqPV-H. Five out of 256 (1.9%) and 21 out of 188 (11.2%) French and Australian horses, respectively, were positive for the molecular detection of EqHV. Australian strains for both viruses were genomically clustered, in contrast to strains from French horses, which were more broadly distributed. The findings of this preliminary survey, with the molecular detection of EqHV and EqPV-H in Australia and the latter in France, adds to the growing body of awareness regarding these recently discovered hepatotropic viruses. It has provided valuable information not just in terms of geographic endemicity but will guide equine clinicians, carers, and authorities regarding infectious agents and potential impacts of allogenic tissue contamination. Although we have filled many gaps in the world map regarding equine hepatotropic viruses, further prospective studies in this emerging field may be useful in terms of elucidating risk factors and pathogenesis of these pathogens and management of cases in terms of prevention and diagnosis. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Intelligent animal husbandry is becoming a priority area of the industry. On the basis of digital technologies, genomic assessment, and artificial intelligence, new opportunities are being formed to improve the organization of breeding and technological processes. For effective horse breeding, coupled with classical breeding methods, modern breeding resource management systems based on innovative approaches are needed. Accurate quantification of phenotypic information about an animal is a difficult task. Of particular importance there are the issues of objectification of animal characteristics by exterior due to the fact that the assessment of external forms is based on visual perception, is not devoid of a subjective approach and is subject to inaccuracies. One of the ways to solve this problem is to switch to a digital assessment of the phenotypes of interest. The article presents the results of the application of deep learning to solve the problem of automatic marking of characteristic points on a digital image of the studied objects. It was revealed that the created and trained neural network architecture as a whole demonstrated good accuracy. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness is a devastating viral disease of equids. It is transmitted by biting midges of the genus Culicoides with mortalities reaching over 90% in naïve horses. It is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and is seasonally endemic in many parts of southern Africa. However, outbreaks in Europe and Asia have occurred that caused significant economic issues. There are attenuated vaccines available for control of the virus but concerns regarding the safety and efficacy means that alternatives are sought. One promising alternative is the use of virus-like particles in vaccine preparations, which have the potential to be safer and more efficacious as vaccines against African horse sickness. These particles are best made in a complex, eukaryotic system, but due to technical challenges, this may cause significant economic strain on the developing countries most affected by the disease. Therefore, this review also summarises the success so far, and potential, of recombinant protein expression in plants to reduce the economic strain of production. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Inadequate management conditions can impair the welfare of captive-bred horses. Understanding individuals’ viewpoints and the factors influencing their decisions about adopting or avoiding certain practices may provide insights into their motivations and decision-making processes. This is particularly relevant in the equestrian community, where equine practitioners and enthusiasts often engage in harmful practices. We explored the beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes of equine practitioners and enthusiasts about horse welfare and the barriers that prevent them from employing better management practices that are essential to promoting horses’ welfare. The study consisted of in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted in person with 31 individuals directly involved in the equestrian environment in Brazil. Responses were analyzed through thematic analysis with a data-driven deductive approach. Participants’ beliefs, knowledge and attitudes to horse welfare were divided into three themes. The first theme, “Let the horse be a horse”, captured participants’ perceptions about how physical and mental aspects related to the nature and welfare of horses. The second theme, “Everyone does it like that”, includes the social norms that influence decisions about the practices that impact on the welfare of the horses. The third theme, “Beyond utopia: how and why horses are managed the way they are”, covered barriers that participants perceived as impediments to the use of best practices for the welfare of horses. While participants demonstrated awareness of welfare issues and acknowledged factors that negatively impact horses, there was a notable discrepancy between this knowledge and the implementation of improved management practices. This could be explained by several perceived barriers to implementing management practices that could enhance horse welfare, including lack of financial resources, limited physical space, shortage of qualified labor, time constraints, inadequate tools, and insufficient knowledge. Additionally, we identified deeply rooted social norms within the equestrian community and culturally established practices that limit approaches to horse welfare. Participants underscored the influence of these norms and different interpretations of “letting the horse be a horse” based on the horse’s value and purpose. Concerning low-value horses, the primary justifications for stall housing and concentrated feeding were linked to elevated costs involved in spatial demands and labor; in contrast, for high-value horses used in performance and aesthetics, the arguments shifted to potential benefits to the horses’ well-being. From an ethical perspective, ideally, individuals should refrain from owning horses if they cannot ensure the animals’ welfare. Additionally, if the equestrian community neglects public attitudes towards animal welfare, it risks eroding its social license. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine Squamous Gastric Disease (ESGD) and Equine Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD) are two terms used to indicate the presence of lesions of the squamous and glandular mucosa of the stomach. Prevalences, pathophysiology, and risk factors are different, and the latter have been investigated in different populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of ESGD and EGGD in a cohort of pleasure, breeding, and retired horses in Italy. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to investigate such a diverse population of animals and the first one that includes a large number of animals in Italy. Gastroscopies were performed in 316 animals, with and without clinical signs of gastric ulcers, and a questionnaire about signalment, management, activity, and health was given to the owners or caretakers. Prevalence of ESGD was similar to the current literature reports in comparable populations, and the disease was associated with signalment, time with the current owner or caretaker, management (time and type of paddock, hay, and supplementary feed administered), and activity performed. In this population, EGGD was present in a lower percentage of animals and, of the parameters evaluated, was associated only with the signalment, while management does not seem to influence the development of lesions in the glandular mucosa in this population. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Body temperature in the horse is a reference measurement that is considered to be an excellent health indicator. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of infrared thermal imaging for fever screening became widespread to detect changes in human body temperature. During the 2021 outbreak of EHV in southern Europe, quarantine and confinement were quickly imposed as the main control measures. This impacted equestrian sport for many months and caused relevant damage. To prevent repetition of these events, the equine sport sector introduced rules to monitor the temperature of the horses before, during and after competitions. The first objective of this study is to assess whether Infrared Thermography (IRT) measurement of either the anus or forehead surface temperature using a FLIR thermal imaging camera is an appropriate alternative to rectal measurements using a thermometer for determining body temperature in horses. The second objective is to assess the possibility of using IRT body temperature measurement on a large scale, for example in the case of an infectious disease epidemic such as EHV-1. 40 healthy geldings from the Swiss Armed Forces with a median age of 7.5 years (range: 4 to 17 years, SD 3.83 years) were used. The study was divided into three periods. The first was the pilot study with 13 horses during the summer. The second was during the winter with 16 horses and the third with 11 horses in early spring. 10 horses in the second study period and 4 horses in the third wore a blanket, while the other 26 horses did not. A conventional veterinary digital thermometer and the FLIR E86 thermal imaging camera were used. The anal IRT measurement was made at a distance of 10cm centred on the middle of the anus. The forehead measurement was made on the midline between the eyes at distances of 20 and 30cm. All measurements were taken three times a day (early morning, midday and late afternoon). The same location was used over all three testing periods. The median difference between measurements of rectal temperature and surface anal temperature was 0.9°C (SD=0.96°C – p value: <2.2×10–16). There was a variation between summer and winter (p value: <2.2×10–16). The ambient temperature was an important parameter influencing the surface anal temperature in our data (p value=6.34×10–29). The median difference between measurements of rectal temperature and surface forehead temperature was 15.2°C (SD=2.83) at 20cm and 15.3°C (SD=2.84°C) at 30cm. Repeated measurements of the surface anal temperature with the FLIR showed that the method is reproducible, with only small differences between the measurements. Neither the surface temperature of the anus nor the forehead as measured with the FLIR allowed efficient prediction of equine rectal temperature. The precision of the methodology applied both to the anus and the forehead was too low to allow the effective implementation of this technology to evaluate equine body temperature. In addition, this method is also insufficiently accurate for measuring body temperatures on a large-scale during events with a large number of horses. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Background: Preliminary evidence indicates that ertugliflozin benefits horses and ponies (hereafter collectively referred to as horses) with hyperinsulinaemia and hyperinsulinaemia-associated laminitis. The effects of ertugliflozin on the results of the oral sugar test used widely in the assessment of insulin dysregulation (ID), have not been reported. Objectives: To report the effects of ertugliflozin on responses to the oral sugar test (OST) in horses with ID. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Clinical records were reviewed to identify horses with ID that had an OST (0.45 mL/kg Karo-Light PO) performed before and after 4 days of treatment with 0.05 mg/kg ertugliflozin PO s.i.d. Pre- and post-treatment insulin concentrations were compared using Wilcoxon sign-ranked tests. Results: Ten horses with ID met the inclusion criteria. Significant reductions in plasma insulin concentration were identified at all time points after 4 days of treatment with ertugliflozin relative to pre-treatment values. At T0 (prior to oral sugar), median insulin concentration reduced from 22.4 μu/mL (IQR: 6.5, 39) pre-treatment to 4.8 μu/mL (IQR: 3.7, 9.2) at day 4 (p = 0.004). At T60 (60 min after oral sugar), median insulin concentration was 165 μu/mL (IQR: 61.2, 222) pre-treatment and 78.1 μu/mL (IQR: 30.5, 137) at day 4 (p = 0.004). At T90 (90 min after oral sugar), median insulin concentration was 170 μu/mL (IQR: 88.6, 269) pre-treatment and 84.7 μu/mL (IQR: 28.7, 122) at day 4 (p = 0.002). Serum triglyceride concentration increased from a median of 0.4 mmol/L (IQR: 0.2, 0.8) pre-treatment to 0.9 mmol/L (IQR: 0.6, 2) at day 4 of ertugliflozin treatment (p = 0.006). Main limitations: A small heterogenous group of horses and ponies, some with PPID, were used in the absence of a control group. Conclusions: Four daily doses of ertugliflozin at 0.05 mg/kg was associated with lowering of insulin concentrations at baseline and in response to an OST in horses with ID; however, insulin levels did not return to normal in all horses. Increases in triglyceride concentrations were also observed. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Purpose of reviewHypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is an independent and casual risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). There is an unmet need for more effective treatments for patients with HTG. Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) are key regulators of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. We review recent clinical trials targeting ANGPTL3 and apoC-III with monoclonal antibody and nucleic acid therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA.Recent findingsANGPTL3 and apoC-III inhibitors are effective in lowering plasma triglycerides and TRLs, with possibly greater efficacy with the inhibition of apoC-III. By contrast to ANGPTL3 inhibition that has the advantage of greater lowering of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apoB levels, apoC-III inhibition only has a modest or no effect in lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol and apoB concentrations. Therapeutic inhibition of ANGPTL3 and apoC-III can correct HTG possibly by reducing production and increasing catabolism of TRL particles, but this remains to be formally investigated in patients with HTG.SummaryNovel agents targeting ANGPTL3 and apoC-III can correct HTG and potentially lower risk of ASCVD in patients with HTG. The long-Term safety and cost-effectiveness of these agents await confirmation in ongoing and future studies. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Host immune analyses require specific reagents to identify cellular and soluble components of the immune system. These immune reagents are often species-specific. For horses, various immunological tools have been developed and tested by different initiatives during the past decades. This article summarizes the development of well characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for equine immune cells, immunoglobulin isotypes, cytokines, and chemokines. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Assessment of type severity and exterior correctness is a necessary breeding measure in breeding work with breeds. Traditionally assessed features demonstrate subjectivism. The assessment of the type severity and the exterior correctness was initially based on the opinion of experts on whether the animal corresponds to a certain type of breed or not. The new method of geometric morphometry, based on comparing objects by their shape without considering differences in size, is of undoubted interest for research aimed at studying the physique features of horses of various intrabreed and breeder types. The key task of the geometric morphometry method is to evaluate the distinctive features of objects in shape, excluding the influence of their differences in size. It is based on the concept of a multidimensional space of forms. The article presents the results of testing the application of the geometric morphometry method for the differentiation of intrabreed horse types of purebred Arabian and performance horse breeds. It is revealed that geometric morphometry within the framework of a theoretical approach can be used as an additional tool to traditional methods of assessing the phenotypic characteristics of horses of various intrabreed types. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Climate change poses major challenges for agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, with drought conditions severely affecting water-intensive crops such as tomatoes. This study evaluates the efficacy of organic amendments, derived from horse manure, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on enhancing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit quality and soil health under semi-arid field conditions. The experimental design included two irrigation regimes (well-watered and drought stress) and two levels of vermicompost application (C1 5 t ha−1 and C2 10 t ha−1), applied individually or in combination with AMF. The results indicate that drought stress reduced tomato fruit growth and yield, while osmoprotectant accumulation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and bioactive compound levels increased, and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of tomato fruit also increased. Notably, the biostimulants application, especially (C1+AMF), counteracted the adverse effects of drought, compared to the control, by significantly enhancing fruit yields (60%), as well as increasing ascorbic acid levels (59%) and free amino acids content (90%). These treatments also improved the activity of bioactive compounds and nutrient uptake in the fruit. Furthermore, biostimulant application positively affected the physicochemical properties of soil. The results obtained confirm that the application of biostimulants can be suitable for improving crop sustainability and adaptability under conditions of water stress in semi-arid field regions. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (tAVNS) in healthy horses and its effect on heart rate variability (HRV). The study comprised three phases: the selection of mares, their acclimatization to the tAVNS, and the stimulation phase. Stimulation was performed with two electrodes positioned on the right pinna. The settings were 0.5 mA, 250 μs, and 25 Hz for pulse amplitude, pulse width, and pulse frequency, respectively. HRV was analysed before (B1), during (T), and after (B2) the tAVNS. From the 44 mares initially included, only 7 completed the three phases. In these mares, the heart rate (HR) was significantly lower, and frequency domain parameters showed an increased parasympathetic tone in B2 compared with B1. However, in 3/7 mares, the HR was significantly higher during T compared with B1 and B2, compatible with a decreased parasympathetic tone, while in 4/7 mares, the HR was significantly lower and the parasympathetic nervous system index was significantly higher during T and B2 compared with B1. The tAVNS is an economical and easy procedure to perform and has the potential to stimulate vagal activity; however, it was poorly tolerated in the mares included in this study. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Plasma cytokine adsorption has shown benefit as an adjunctive therapy in human sepsis but has yet to be investigated in horses. We hypothesized that ex vivo filtration of equine plasma with a novel cytokine adsorption device would significantly reduce concentrations of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokines. We also hypothesized that the device would adsorb medications commonly used to treat sepsis. ANIMALS 8 horses owned by North Carolina State University. METHODS Four liters of heparinized whole blood was collected from healthy adult horses (n = 8) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/mL) for 6 hours (37 °C.) from June 4, 2023, to December 15, 2023. Plasma was filtered through a cytokine adsorption device or sham circuit. Samples were collected at 11 time points for multiplex cytokine analysis. Chemistry analysis was performed before and after filtration. To investigate the impact of the device on medication concentrations, equine plasma containing potassium penicillin, gentamicin, and flunixin meglumine was filtered through the cytokine adsorption device or sham for 6 hours. Drug concentrations before and after filtration were determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. Prefiltration versus postfiltration sample concentrations were analyzed by Student paired t test using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (P < .05). RESULTS Filtration of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated equine plasma (n = 8) for 6 hours resulted in significant mean reductions in the cytokines IL-10, IL-5, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-1β, as well as albumin. Drug concentrations of potassium penicillin, gentamicin, and flunixin meglumine were also significantly reduced by filtration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This work provides proof of concept for further investigation of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption as a potential adjunct treatment for equine sepsis. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Examining the modal analysis of an integrated structure consisting of a box-girder bridge and a tunnel with a railroad track is critical for ensuring structural integrity, safety, and functionality, especially concerning resonance with time-varying external forces such as vehicle and seismic loads. Prior studies have indicated that modal analysis of this kind of integrated system has received little attention. The key objective of this research is to determine the natural frequency and mode shape of this integrated system. The free vibration analysis of the FEM model of the integrated system is carried out by the FEM software, ANSYS. The modal character parameters of the present model are investigated by comparing free vibration analysis with and without a railway track. The natural frequencies of this model without the railway track system were reduced as an outcome of a decrease in model stiffness. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: The ability of human melanoma cells to switch from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype contributes to the metastatic potential of disease. Metalloproteinases (MPs) are crucially involved in this process by promoting the detachment of tumor cells from the primary lesion and their migration to the vasculature. In gray horse melanoma, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is poorly understood, prompting us to address MP expression in lesions versus intact skin by transcriptome analyses and the immunofluorescence staining (IF) of gray horse tumor tissue and primary melanoma cells. RNAseq revealed the deregulation of several MPs in gray horse melanoma and, notably, a 125-fold upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) that was further confirmed by RT-qPCR from additional tumor material. The IF staining of melanoma tissue versus intact skin for MMP1 and tumor marker S100 revealed MMP1 expression in all lesions. The co-expression of S100 was observed at different extents, with some tumors scoring S100-negative. The IF staining of primary tumor cells explanted from the tumors for MMP1 showed that the metalloproteinase is uniformly expressed in the cytoplasm of 100% of tumor cells. Overall, the presented data point to MP expression being deregulated in gray horse melanoma, and suggest that MMP1 has an active role in gray horse melanoma by driving EMT-mediated tumor cell dissemination via the degradation of the extracellular matrix. Whilst S100 is considered a reliable tumor marker in human MM, gray horse melanomas do not seem to regularly express this protein. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Neurological diseases and injuries in veterinary patients (horses, dogs, and cats) are complex, and effective treatment options are limited. Neuronal loss, damage to nerve conduction pathways, and inflammation and scarring associated with spinal cord injury pose major challenges in managing many neurological diseases. Furthermore, most of these neuropathologies lack definitive pharmacological treatments, driving interest and research into novel interventions. Our objective is to provide a narrative review of the current literature surrounding cellular therapies including neuronal and glial stem cells, neurotrophic factors, mesenchymal stem or stromal cells, and cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of diverse neurological pathologies. Cellular therapies have the potential for cellular replacement, immune modulation, and paracrine signaling and the flexibility of being used alone or alongside surgical intervention. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells are arguably the most researched cellular therapy and have been administered intrathecally, IV, intra-arterially, intranasally, and intraspinally with few adverse reactions. Limited clinical and experimental studies have suggested efficacy in diseases including acute spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc disease. Little is currently known about the safety and efficacy of neural stem cells, precursor cell administration, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived treatments. Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy and long-term safety of cellular therapies. Future aims should include larger controlled clinical trials in companion animals for common neurologic conditions including acute spinal cord injury, intervertebral disc disease, peripheral nerve injury, degenerative neuropathies, and age-associated cognitive decline. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The breeding history of the Einsiedler horse is closely connected with the Benedictine cloister Einsiedeln. In the mid-nineteenth century, it was decided to use European Warmblood stallions for cross-breeding and to abandon the selection of stallions. Since that time, it has only been possible to trace back the origin of Einsiedler horses using maternal ancestry information. Here, we collected high-density genotype data for European Warmblood horses (Selle Français, Swiss Warmblood and Einsiedler) and Franches-Montagnes horses, the last native Swiss horse breed, to unravel the current population structure of the Einsiedler horse. Using commonly applied methods to ascertain fine-scale population structures, it was not possible to clearly differentiate the Einsiedler from other European Warmblood horses. However, by means of runs of homozygosity (ROH) we were able to detect breed-specific ROH islands for the Einsiedler horse, including genes involved in domestication and adaptation to high altitude. Therefore, future breeding activities should involve the screening of these breed-specific ROH segments, the revival of cryopreserved sperm and the selection of Einsiedler stallions. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible use of spectrophotometric assays for the measurement of trace elements, including Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe) in the saliva of horses and study their possible changes in equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS). EGUS is a highly prevalent disease, with a current high incidence due to the increase in intensive management conditions. There are two EGUS diseases: equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) and equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD), which can appear individually or together. For this purpose, automated spectrophotometric assays for measuring these analytes in horse saliva were analytically validated. Then, these analytes were measured in the saliva of horses with only ESGD, only EGGD, both ESGD and EGGD and a group of healthy horses. The methods used to measure the analytes were precise and accurate. Horses diagnosed with EGGD presented significantly lower levels of Zn and Mg. Fe concentrations were significantly lower in the saliva of horses with ESGD and EGGD. Overall, these results indicate that there are changes in trace elements in saliva in EGUS that could reflect the physiopathological mechanisms involved in this process and open the possibility of using trace elements as biomarkers of this syndrome. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Baise horse, an indigenous horse breed mainly distributed in the Baise region of Guangxi province in southwest China, has a long history as draft animal. However, there is a lack of research regarding the origin and ancestral composition of the Baise horse. In this study, whole-genome resequencing data from 236 horses of seven Chinese indigenous horse breeds, five foreign horse breeds, and four Przewalski's horses were used to investigate the relationships between the Baise horse and other horse breeds. The results showed that foreign horse breeds had no significant impact on the formation of the Baise horse. The two southwestern horse populations, the Debao pony and the Jinjiang horse, exhibit the closest genetic affinity with the Baise horse. This is consistent with their adjacent geographical distribution. Analysis of the migration route revealed a gene flow from the Chakouyi horse into the Baise horse. In summary, our results confirm that the formation of the Baise horse did not involve participation from foreign breeds. Geographical distance emerges as a crucial factor in determining the genetic relationships with the Baise horse. Gene flows of indigenous horse breeds along ancient routes of trade activities had played a role in the formation of the Baise horse. © 2024 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to analyse the level of variability in the autosomal genome, especially in the equine major histocompatibility complex region, in five horse breeds and identify heterozygosity-rich regions and potential footprints of balancing selection. Depending on data quality control, the dataset consisted of 51,168 or 53,874 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, available for 514 individuals (89 Lipizzan, 238 Old Kladruber, 47 Shagya Arabian, 61 Czech Warmblood and 81 Slovak Warmblood horses). Genomic variability within and between breeds was examined based on levels of heterozygosity (observed and expected), genomic inbreeding, Wright's FIS index and linkage disequilibrium. Subsequently, the screening of heterozygosity-rich regions and balancing selection signals derived from Tajima's D positive values was performed. As expected, due to the polymorphic nature of the major histocompatibility complex, the genomic variability level was generally higher when analysing only markers located in this area (mainly around genes belonging to class I). The Slovak and Czech Warmblood horses, as breeds with open herdbook, showed higher average values of heterozygosity indices than Lipizzan, Old Kladruber or Shagya Arabian breeds. Concerning only markers in the major histocompatibility complex region in complete or very high linkage disequilibrium, common patterns were found close to EQMHCB2, MHCB3 and EQMHCC1 genes belonging to class I and DQA1, DRB2, DRB3 and HLA-DOB genes from class II. Genome-wide, the number of heterozygosity-rich regions per animal ranged from 345.25 (Old Kladruber) to 603.33 (Czech Warmblood). Across all breeds, 254 heterozygosity-rich regions were detected directly in the major histocompatibility complex region (194 in class I and 60 in class II). Among them, the highest overlap showed regions found in the genomes of historically connected Czech and Slovak Warmblood breeds. The results suggested that the frequency of markers in heterozygosity-rich regions increased in Lipizzan, Old Kladruber and Shagya Arabian breeds in the genomic region of EQMCE1 gene (class I) and in Czech and Slovak Warmblood horses in DQB1, DQA2, DQB2, DQA3 and DRB2 genes (class II). Although the identified heterozygosity-rich regions formed 330 islands across the genomes of tested breeds, these islands were outside the major histocompatibility complex region. On the other hand, four of 425 balancing selection signals detected across breeds were located directly in the major histocompatibility complex region, close to DRA, DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DQB2 genes (class II). Shared islands and balancing selection footprints among breeds were found mainly on chromosomes 7 and 11. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The nanocrystal (NC) technology has become one of the most commonly used strategies for the formulation of poorly soluble actives. Given their large specific surface, NCs are mainly used to enhance the oral absorption of poorly soluble actives. Differently from conventional nanoparticles, which require the use of carrier materials and have limited drug loadings, NCs’ drug loading approaches 100% since they are formed of the pure drug and surrounded by a thin layer of a stabilizer. In this work, we report the covalent decoration of curcumin NCs with folic acid (FA) using EDC/NHS chemistry and explore the novel systems as highly loaded “Trojan horses” to target cancer cells. The decorated NCs demonstrated a remarkable improvement in curcumin uptake, exhibiting enhanced growth inhibition in cancer cells (HeLa and MCF7) while sparing healthy cells (J774A.1). Cellular uptake studies revealed significantly heightened entry of FA-decorated NCs into cancer cells compared to unmodified NCs while also showing reduced uptake by macrophages, indicating a potential for prolonged circulation in vivo.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to characterize extracellular vesicles (EVs) in plasma and synovial fluid obtained from horses with and without naturally occurring post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). ANIMALS EVs were isolated from plasma and synovial fluid from horses with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) PTOA. METHODS Plasma and synovial fluid EVs were characterized with respect to quantity, size, and surface markers. Small RNA sequencing was performed, and differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) underwent bioinformatic analysis to identify putative targets and to explore potential associations with specific biological processes. RESULTS Plasma and synovial fluid samples from horses with PTOA had a significantly higher proportion of exosomes and a lower proportion of microvesicles compared to horses without PTOA. Small RNA sequencing revealed several differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-144, miR-219-3p, and miR-199a-3l in plasma and miR-199a-3p, miR-214, and miR-9094 in synovial fluid EVs. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs highlighted their potential role in fibrosis, differentiation of chondrocytes, apoptosis, and inflammation pathways in PTOA. CLINICAL RELEVANCE We have identified dynamic molecular changes in the small noncoding signatures of plasma and synovial fluid EVs in horses with naturally occurring PTOA. These findings could serve to identify promising biomarkers in the pathogenesis of PTOA, to facilitate the development of targeted therapies, and to aid in establishing appropriate translational models of PTOA. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The Garrano is a semi-feral horse breed native to several mountains in the northern Iberian Peninsula. Despite being endangered, this unique breed of pony has managed to survive in the wild and continues to be selectively bred, highlighting their remarkable resilience and adaptability to harsh environments. Wildlife plays a critical role in the survival of tick vectors in their natural habitats and the transfer of tick-borne pathogens, as they can serve as reservoir hosts for many agents and amplifiers for these vectors. The semi-feral lifestyle of the Garrano horses makes them particularly vulnerable to exposure to numerous tick species throughout the year. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Babesia, Theileria, and spotted fever rickettsiae in the Garrano horse ticks to obtain a knowledge of circulating agents in this host population. The collected ticks (n = 455) were identified as Rhipicephalus bursa. DNA specimens were organized in pools of 5 ticks, for molecular screening. Pools PCR results confirmed the presence of Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae (n = 12 for the ompB gene, n = 11 for the ompA gene and n = 6 for the gltA gene), Babesia bigemina (n = 1), Babesia caballi (n = 3), Theileria equi (n = 15) and Theileria haneyi (n = 1).These results confirm the circulation of an emerging rickettsial spotted fever group member, Candidatus R. barbariae, in R. bursa ticks. Our findings demonstrated that Candidatus R. barbariae co-circulates with B. bigemina and T. equi, which are vectored by R. bursa. We are reporting for the first time, the detection of T. haneyi among R. bursa ticks feeding in the Garrano horses in Portugal. Surveillance studies for tick-borne infections are essential to provide information that can facilitate the implementation of preventive and control strategies. © 2024

ABSTRACT: L-carnitine (LC) transports fatty acids to the mitochondria for energy production, reducing lipid availability for peroxidation through β-oxidation. This research examines the effect of LC supplementation to two skimmed milk-based extenders on the cryosurvival of chilled (5°C) and frozen-thawed Peruvian Paso horse spermatozoa .An initial experiment determined the optimal LC concentration (0, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mM) when added to INRA-96® and UHT (skimmed milk + 6% egg yolk) extenders, using nine ejaculates from three stallions chilled for up to 96 h. Subsequently, the effect of 25 mM LC supplementation (the optimal concentration) on chilling (INRA-96) and freezing (INRA-Freeze®) extenders was evaluated using eight pooled samples from sixteen ejaculates (2 ejaculates/pool) from four stallions. Results indicated that all LC concentrations produced significantly higher values (P<0.05) for kinematic variables (total [TM] and progressive motilities, curvilinear [VCL] and straight-line [VSL] velocity, and beat-cross frequency [BCF]), and the integrity of plasma/acrosome membranes (IPIA) compared to non-supplemented chilled sperm samples for up to 96 h with both extenders. Moreover, the use of 25 mM LC was more efficient (P<0.05) in preserving the post-chilled values of velocity, BCF, and IPIA for the long term than lower LC concentrations (1–10 mM). Post-thaw values of total motility, the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and IPIA were significantly improved (P<0.05) when INRA-Freeze extender was supplemented with 25 mM LC. In conclusion, supplementation of L-carnitine to skimmed milk-based extenders enhanced kinematic variables and protected the membrane integrity in chilled and frozen-thawed Peruvian Paso horse spermatozoa. © 2024 Society for Cryobiology

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To investigate mechanistically the reported beneficial effects of immune-activated mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy to treat equine septic arthritis, leveraging Nanostring technology. ANIMALS 8 Quarter Horses with induced tibiotarsal Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis treated IA with either Toll-like receptor-3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-activated MSCs + vancomycin antimicrobials (TLR-MSC-VAN; n = 4) or antimicrobials (VAN; 4). METHODS Synovial tissues were collected and fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded synovial and osteochondral tissues were sequenced using a custom-designed 200-gene equine Nanostring nCounter immune panel to directly quantify expression of key immune and cartilage-related genes. Immunohistochemistry to detect CD3+ T cells was performed on synovial tissues to further quantify T-cell infiltration in TLR-MSC-VAN- versus VAN-treated joints. RESULTS Comparison of synovial transcriptomes between groups revealed moderate changes in differential gene expression, with upregulated expression of 9 genes and downregulated expression of 17 genes with fold change ≥ 2 or ≤ -2 and a significant false discovery rate-adjusted P value of ≤ .05. The most upregulated genes in TLR-MSC-VAN-treated horses included those related to T-lymphocyte recruitment and function, while pathways related to innate immune activation and inflammation were significantly downregulated. Immunohistochemistry and quantitation of CD3+ T-cell infiltrates revealed a numerically greater infiltrate in synovial tissues of TLR-MSC-VAN-treated horses, which did not reach statistical significance in this small sample set (P = .20). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Targeted transcriptomic analyses using an equine Nanostring immune and cartilage health panel provided new mechanistic insights into how innate and adaptive immune cells within synovial tissues respond to TLR-activated MSC treatment when used to treat septic arthritis. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Hematology is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate the health status of horses. However, breed differences are often not considered. Objectives: The objective was to compare complete blood count variables among Warmbloods, Thoroughbreds, and stock horses (SH). Methods: Ninety-six healthy horses were grouped by breed (Warmbloods, Thoroughbreds, and SH). Samples were collected through venipuncture for complete blood count analysis. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's tests or Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn's post hoc tests were used to compare hematologic variables among groups. Results: Warmbloods had a significantly lower total white blood cell (WBC) count (6.08 ± 1.11 × 109/L) and lymphocyte count (1.76 ± 0.41 × 109/L) than Thoroughbreds (7.28 ± 1.45; 2.28 ± 5.16 × 109/L, respectively; P <.001) and SH (7.21 ± 1.18 × 109/L, P <.01; 2.10 ± 5.17 × 109/L; P <.05). Warmbloods had a significantly lower red blood cell count (7.7 ± 0.8 × 1012/L) and higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 49.4 ± 2.2 fL) than Thoroughbreds (8.42 ± 1.2 × 1012/L, P <.01; 47.3 ± 3.0 fL). Warmbloods had lower MCVs than SH (49.4 ± 2.2 vs 51.2 ± 2.6 fL). The mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was higher in Warmbloods (35.0, 33.8–36.2 g/dL) and Thoroughbreds (34.9, 33.4–35.7 g/dL) than in SH breeds (34.0, 33.4–35.4 g/dL; P <.001, both). Total protein concentrations were significantly lower in Thoroughbreds (67, 59–80 g/L) compared with SH (71, 64–83 g/dL) (P <.05). Conclusions: Warmbloods had decreased WBC and lymphocyte counts compared with Thoroughbreds and SH, and Thoroughbreds had increased red blood cell counts. Thoroughbreds had lower total protein concentrations than SH. Clinicians should consider breed differences when interpreting hematologic values. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The article discusses the prospects for the development of organic horse breeding in Yakutia. The potential of Yakutia in the development of organic animal husbandry is justified by the presence of a huge territory with a favorable environmental situation, the presence of vast areas remote from industrial centers that meet the concept of ecoproducts. It is noted that Yakut traditional animal husbandry, especially herd horse breeding, is suitable for organic animal husbandry, due to the fact that the requirements are ideally met. Organic animal husbandry requires keeping animals in the most environmentally friendly conditions, where there is no environmental pollution. in the natural way of life to which animals are adapted, where the traditional management system adheres, where animals are adapted to local conditions, emphasis should be placed on the use of organic feeds, which should be natural, nutritious and provide animals with normal physiology and metabolism, should not contain harmful substances, purebred animals without crossbreeds are welcome, that is, local breeds with high resistance to adverse maintenance factors. It is noted that the Yakut horse breeding, with a special technology of maintenance and feeding, provides environmentally friendly dietary, delicatessen products (foal, internal fat, blood, etc.), which has the prospect of being an export product. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of the study was to study the dynamics of the main selected traits in horses of the New Altai breed and the genetic characteristics of the breed. In this paper, the indicators of the main measurements of the body and live weight of horses, depending on gender and region of birth, are analyzed. The main genetic and population parameters of the breed were calculated based on microsatellite DNA loci: the total number of alleles at 17 loci (Na), the average number of alleles per locus (Nv), the level of polymorphism (Ae), observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity, coefficients of intrapopulation inbreeding (Fis), genetic similarity (RXY) and genetic distances (DXY). It has been established that the horses of the New Altai breed are characterized by a relatively high level of polymorphism and genetic diversity, both in the breed as a whole and in the context of breeding regions. The high genetic similarity of the New Altai breed with the Russian Heavy Draft and Altai breeds has been revealed. The study of the genetic structure of the breed, the levels of its intra- and inter-population diversity in combination with classical zootechnical assessment methods showed the consistency of the chosen cultivation strategy of the New Altai breed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: A 6-year-old female Friesian horse was admitted with pyrexia, dullness, weight loss, watery faeces and mild bilateral mucoid nasal discharge. Radiographic and ultrasonographic examination of the thorax indicated a large mid-thoracic soft tissue mass, and the horse was euthanased because of a poor prognosis. At postmortem examination, it was found that the lung tissue was partly replaced by multiple to coalescing soft tissue lesions with a yellow gelatinous aspect, varying in size up to 15 × 15 × 20 cm. Histologically, the mass showed mild pyogranulomatous inflammation associated with large numbers of globular encapsulated 10–20 μm yeasts with or without narrow-based budding, consistent with multiple coalescing cryptococcomas. Quantitative PCR testing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue led to the identification of Cryptococcus gattii species complex. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case reported in the Netherlands of pulmonary cryptococcomas due to C. gattii sensu lato in a horse that had never travelled abroad. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Inguinal hernias (IHs) and ruptures are a relatively common condition in horses, occurring in foals (congenital) and adult (acquired) animals. A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on 40 cases that underwent laparoscopic surgery to close the VRs using barbed sutures alone or combined with other techniques. Signalment, clinical presentation, surgery, and follow-up data were obtained. In total, fifty-nine VRs were closed using barbed sutures (alone or in combination with other methods), with six cases performed prophylactically and forty-four due to acquired IH. Of the forty-four cases with IH, four were non-strangulated hernias, while thirty presented with strangulated small intestines (twenty-eight acquired and two congenital). The results obtained in this study suggest that laparoscopic hernioplasty with barbed sutures is an effective and safe surgical procedure that could be recommended as a standard practice for managing inguinal hernias in horses, particularly when sparing testicles or preserving reproductive capabilities is a priority. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The vascularization pattern of the equine stifle joint is insufficiently described in the literature, even though there is a growing need for knowledge of the exact blood supply, as (i) arthroscopy and endoscopic surgery techniques are increasingly performed in horses and (ii) ex vivo models of menisci need nutrient supply that mimic the in vivo situation. The aim of this study was to describe the vessels involved in the stifle joint supply and the exact branching pattern of the popliteal artery. Colored latex was injected into the arteries of nine pelvic limbs of equine cadavers (n = 6) to evaluate the occurrences, variations and approximate diameters of vessels that supplied the stifle joints. Next to a branch of the saphenous and descending genicular arteries, eleven branches of the popliteal artery could be described in horses that feed the vascular network of the stifle joint. With a focus on the blood supply of the menisci, a vascularization map was created to show the main influx to these intra-articular structures in detail. These findings are potentially of great importance to both clinicians in preparation of best-suited incisions for arthroscopy and researchers designing new approaches for meniscal studies and choosing suitable animal models. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A 13-year-old mare was referred to the Equine Hospital of the University of Liege for colic, 1 week after foaling and was submitted to emergency laparotomy. During anaesthesia, the horse developed ventricular bigeminy that did not compromise haemodynamic stability. Lidocaine (two intravenous [iv] boluses of 1 mg/kg, followed by iv infusion of 1–2 mg/kg/h) effectively terminated the arrhythmia and the animal recovered uneventfully. Although cardiac arrhythmias associated with gastrointestinal disorders are mostly attributed to endotoxaemia, cardiac workup performed postoperatively should not be overlooked. The mare was discharged 23 days after surgery. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: A 2-year-old racing Thoroughbred gelding in training was presented with moderate (6/10) right hindlimb lameness unresponsive to regional anaesthesia of the right hindlimb. Gamma scintigraphic examination revealed severe, focal, increased radio-pharmaceutical uptake over the dorsal aspect of the right 18th rib, which had an abnormal contour. Ultrasonographic examination of this area confirmed the presence of a complete, displaced fracture of the proximal aspect of the right 18th rib. Local infiltration with anaesthetic solution around the right 18th right rib (10 mL cranial and 10 mL caudal to the fracture site) abolished the right hindlimb lameness. A diagnosis of rib fracture causing moderate ipsilateral hindlimb lameness was made. The horse returned to walking exercise after 12 weeks of rest and was reported to be sound on the same limb 12 months after presentation. Caudal rib fractures should be considered as a possible cause of hindlimb lameness. Local diagnostic anaesthesia around the fracture site can aid localisation of the origin of lameness. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Preserving genetic diversity is pivotal for enhancing genetic improvement and facilitating adaptive responses to selection. This study focuses on identifying key genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion/deletion polymorphisms (INDELs), and copy number variants (CNVs), while exploring the genomic evolutionary connectedness among seven Iranian horses representing five indigenous breeds: Caspian, Turkemen, DareShuri, Kurdish, and Asil. Using whole-genome resequencing, we generated 2.7 Gb of sequence data, with raw reads ranging from 1.2 Gb for Caspian horses to 0.38 Gb for Turkoman horses. Post-filtering, approximately 1.9 Gb of reads remained, with ~ 1.5 Gb successfully mapped to the horse reference genome (EquCab3.0), achieving mapping rates between 76.4% (Caspian) and 98.35% (Turkoman). We identified 2,909,816 SNPs in Caspian horses, constituting around 0.1% of the genome. Notably, 71% of these SNPs were situated in intergenic regions, while 8.5 and 6.8% were located upstream and downstream, respectively. A comparative analysis of SNPs between Iranian and non-Iranian horse breeds showed that Caspian horses had the lowest number of shared SNPs with Turkoman horses. Instead, they showed a closer genetic relationship with DareShuri, Quarter, Arabian, Standardbred, and Asil breeds. Hierarchical clustering highlighted Caspian horses as a distinct cluster, underscoring their distinctive genomic signature. Caspian horses exhibit a unique genetic profile marked by an enrichment of private mutations in neurological genes, influencing sensory perception and awareness. This distinct genetic makeup shapes mating preferences and signifies a separate evolutionary trajectory. Additionally, significant non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in reproductive genes offer intervention opportunities for managing Caspian horses. These findings reveal the population genetic structure of Iranian horse breeds, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in areas such as conservation, performance traits, climate adaptation, reproduction, and resistance to diseases in equine science. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024. corrected publication 2024.

ABSTRACT: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a worrying example of antimicrobial resistance, and it is essential to acquire new information to monitor the spread and limit it further diffusion. This study aimed to characterise 22 MRSA isolates from horses, dogs, cats, and their human handlers focusing on spa typing. In the analysis of the sequences obtained, the spa type is “unknown” (unidentified) and all the sequences except one had repeats previously not known in all databases potentially indicating new spa-repeats. This could possibly indicate either permanent import of novel spa types or in-house microevolution of spa repeats. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Sacroiliac dysfunction (SID) is a condition seen in horses associated with poor performance that affects hind limb gait and impulsion. The condition comprises pain and dysfunction but there lacks clarity around the aetiopathogenesis and whether SID encompasses abnormal joint pathology, abnormal joint movement, abnormal regional biomechanical function, joint laxity and pain, or various combinations of these that may vary over time. Clinical assessment remains challenging for equine clinicians due to the deep location of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) and surrounding structures which limits access for palpation, diagnostic imaging and joint-specific injection. There is no recognised single reference standard diagnostic test for SID. Clinical diagnosis has been based on ruling out other causes of hind limb lameness, along with combinations of ultrasonography, scintigraphy and periarticular anaesthesia of the SIJ. Recent studies have highlighted the lack of specificity of injections targeting the SIJ, with significant dispersal of injectate into surrounding structures including around the lumbosacral joint (LSJ). Advanced imaging modalities such as computed tomography offers promise for assessment of the structure and pathology of the SIJ and surrounding bony structures. However, there is a need to improve the understanding of the significance of anatomic variation of the sacroiliac region structures, with recent studies reporting detailed anatomic variation in groups of horses with and without SID. There are also limitations around functional assessment of the joint which is still largely reliant on a thorough clinical examination. This review aims to present an update on clinical approaches to the diagnosis of horses with SID, and to consider the challenges and limitations. © 2024

ABSTRACT: This article shows that the German philosopher Hermann Schmitz’s new phenomenology can make a valuable contribution to human–animal studies. The three concepts suitable for this purpose are, first, Schmitz’s concept of embodied communication, which can be applied to trans-species encounters; second, his understanding of atmospheres, which are always co-communicated in trans-species encounters; and, third, his conception of situation, which can help with analyzing the relationship of society to animals. My contribution applies these three basic elements of new phenomenology—embodied communication, atmosphere, and situation—to the analysis of the encounters between humans and horses. This paper demonstrates that embodied communication in particular is not only a worthwhile object of research but can also serve as a mode of producing scientific insight. © 2024 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Postural adaptation is a prominent feature in horses affected by laminitis. Laminitis induces intense pain, especially in the forelimbs, prompting affected horses to assume a caudally displaced trunk posture, resulting in the hyperflexion of the thoracolumbar spine. This study assessed the nature and prevalence of thoracolumbar injuries in horses with chronic laminitis compared to horses without it. Sixty horses were used (thirty laminitic and thirty non-laminitic) of different athletic purposes and ages (2–20 years). The experimental protocol entailed a single assessment of horses’ thoracolumbar spines, utilizing physical examination by MACCTORE, a scoring system developed specifically for this study. Additional evaluations included the Grimace Equine Pain Scale (HGS) and ultrasound exams. Statistical tests were used to compare values (Mann–Whitney or t-test) and lesions prevalences (Fisher) between groups (p < 0.05). The results showed a higher pain manifestation (HGS and heart rate, p < 0.0001) and thoracolumbar-spine-injury levels in chronic laminitis horses, both in MACCTORE clinical examinations (11.7 ± 4.8 vs. 4.2 ± 3.3, p < 0.0001) and general ultrasonographic indices (39.6 ± 12.0 vs. 20.7 ± 7.1, p < 0.0001), including specific examination approaches for various spinal elements. Horses with laminitis presented with a 14-fold higher prevalence of ultrasound-relevant lesions in the thoracolumbar spine (CI: 4.4 to 50.6, p < 0.0001) compared to controls. These findings constitute new evidence of an association between chronic laminitis and the presence of thoracolumbar spine injuries in horses, which may be confirmed by more sophisticated study designs. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding gastrointestinal parasite distribution is crucial for effective control programs in horses. This study reports the prevalence of helminth infections in horses and selected risk factors (i.e., breed, age, climate, season) by analyzing 19,276 fecal samples from the Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Parasitology, in Curitiba, Southern Brazil. The analyses were carried out from 2008 to 2019, coming from 153 stud farms located in 60 municipalities of nine Brazilian states. The parasite prevalence was 73.3%, with 72.1% present in the adult population and 80.6% in young horses. Strongyles were present in 100% horse farms. Strongyles had a prevalence of 72.1% with a mean FEC of 453.53 (+/− 717.6). Parascaris spp. had a prevalence of 5.8% and a FEC of 17.11 (+/− 149.2). The tropical wet/monsoon climate (Am) showed the lowest FEC for strongyles and Parascaris spp. when compared to the other climates. In the logistic regression analysis, young horses exhibited 4.6 times higher odds ratio (OR) (3.9–5.5) of Parascaris spp. and 1.2 (1.1–1.4) times higher OR of strongyles egg shedding when compared to adults (P < 0.001). Summer presented a higher risk for Parascaris spp. and Strongyles eggs when compared to the other seasons (P < 0.001). Mangalarga Marchador, Criollo, and Crossbred breeds were identified with higher OR of Parascaris spp. egg shedding than Thoroughbred. The extensive prevalence of strongyles across ages, seasons, breeds, and climates alerts for the risk of clinical manifestations in equines raised on pastures designing optimal health management and parasite control strategies worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Aortic regurgitation (AR) is an important condition in equine medicine. It is considered a clinically relevant cardiac disease in horses, and the prevalence of the disease changes according to the study population, type of sport, and breed. Aortic regurgitation can be acute or chronic, and the diastolic reversal of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle can be longstanding enough to develop congestive heart failure, exercise intolerance, poor athletic performance, dyspnea, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The diagnostic methods used in clinical practice are noninvasive pulse pressure measurement, two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography, and most prominently, color flow, pulse wave, and continuous- wave Doppler echocardiography. Recently, tissue Doppler imaging and two-dimensional speckle tracking have been reported as diagnostic methods for horses with aortic regurgitation. The influence of this disease on athletic performance needs further investigation, mainly because it can have an economic impact on owners of athlete horses, and accurate diagnosis and classification are the cornerstones to understanding the effects of the disease. The diagnosis of aortic regurgitation must be made using a multi-parameter approach, especially if an association between aortic regurgitation and poor athletic performance is suspected. Therefore, this review aimed to integrate and create a compilation of current diagnostic methods for diagnosing and classifying aortic regurgitation in horses. © 2024 Istanbul University.

ABSTRACT: Insufficient research on the material basis and functional product development of horse bones has led to the waste of resources. This paper, as the by-product of horse meat bone marrow was the object, aimed to discover the flavor and antioxidant activity of novel collagen peptides. Two peptides, HBMP-1-1 and HBMP-2-1, were isolated and purified from horse bone marrow collagen protein (HBMP) hydrolysates. The combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods including SDS-PAGE, UV, FT-IR, CD, and SEM identified the structures of the peptides. The amino acid composition, flavor characteristics, and antioxidant activity were also evaluated. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the molecular weight of the two peptides was concentrated under 4.1 kDa. The total amino acid contents of the HBMP-1-1 was up to 570.779 mg/g. Leucine, alanine, and glutamicacid were the predominant amino acids in HBMP-1-1 with high nutritional value, and it contained 10.07% β-folding, 46.39% β-turn, and 43.54% random coil structure. The peptide sequences IDDPTDSKPE, LNGKLTGM, ELDEGYVPK, AFQEDPDKF, and FVGKVVDPTQK with molecular weights of 1116.51, 833.45, 1049.51, 1096.49, and 1217.69 Da were detected using LC-MS/MS. The results of the antioxidant activity test showed that separation and purification significantly improved the bioactivity of the protein. The half-inhibition rate of HBMP-1-1 against DPPH, ABTS, and hydroxyl radicals were 0.054, 0.050, and 0.137 mg/mL, respectively. This article provides a scientific basis for clarifying the material basis of horse bone marrow collagen peptides. Also, it provides new approaches and ideas for exploring efficient and safe bone-derived lead compounds and products. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Chinese horse bean-chili-paste (CHCP) is a traditional and famous high-salt fermented condiment in southwest China, and salt reduction strategy in this industry is imperative. In this study, we investigated the effect of inoculation with two endogenous strains (Tetragenococcus halophilus and Wickerhamiella versatilis) on the products quality at different salinity. The results showed that salt reduction combined with microbial inoculation showed prominent impact on the volatile profile. A total of 15 compounds was identified as key flavors, and bioturbation fermentation could significantly promote the concentrations of many pleasant aroma volatiles. Quantitative microbial profile analysis identified 29 key genera that might benefit microbial stability. In addition, bioturbation fermentation stimulated more microbial communities to contribute to the formation of key flavors. Moreover, the metabolic pathways of key flavor compounds were further investigated and preliminary results suggest that bioturbation under low-salt conditions promotes high expression of enzymes involved in the formation of these compounds, thereby increasing the abundance of key flavor compounds. These results revealed the variations of microbial communities in low-salt CHCP after biofortification fermentation and their influences on flavor metabolism, which could provide references for the manufacture of low-salt fermented foods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to compare the sedative and cardiovascular effects of the combination of xylazine-acepromazine versus xylazine-pregabalin - in horses. Four healthy crossbred horses were included in the study and assigned to two treatments. In treatment I (T1), the animals received xylazine hydrochloride (1.00 mg kg-1) in combination with acepromazine maleate (0.05 mg kg-1) intravenously. In treatment II (T2), the animals received intragastric administration of pregabalin (4.00 mg kg-1) followed by xylazine hydrochloride (1.00 mg kg-1) intravenously after 60 min. Head height above ground (HHAG) and echocardiographic indices were evaluated. In T1, recordings were made 5 minubefore and 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 minu after drug administration. In T2, recordings were made 5 min before pregabalin, 55 minu after pregabalin administration, and then 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after xylazine hydrochloride acepromazine injection. Analyses of the data showed there were no significant differences regarding HHAG and echocardiographic indices between the two treatments. Intragastric administration of pregabalin prior to xylazine could be considered as an alternative premedication regimen when acepromazine administration is contraindicated or undesirable. © 2024 Urmia University.

ABSTRACT: Anthelmintic performance against equine cyathostomins can be evaluated by two different non-terminal measures; the Fecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) and the Egg Reappearance Period (ERP). Most available FECRT and ERP data have been determined in populations of young horses, and very little information is available from mature and senior horses. Furthermore, it is unknown how commonly occurring equine endocrine disorders such as Insulin dysregulation (ID) and Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) may interfere with these measurements, but it has been suggested that horses with these conditions could be more susceptible to parasitic infections. A research population of senior horses and horses with or without PPID, ID, or both were enrolled in this study. All strongylid egg count positive horses were included in an ivermectin (200 μg/kg) efficacy study. These were distributed among the following groups: ID: six, PPID: three, PPID and ID: seven, and healthy controls: three. Strongylid fecal egg counts were determined on the day of ivermectin administration, at two weeks post deworming, and on weekly intervals until eight weeks post treatment. Determination of FECRT and ERP were carried out following World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology guidelines. Results revealed high ivermectin efficacy with mean egg count reduction at 99.7% or above in all groups at two weeks post treatment. Egg reappearance was documented at six and seven weeks in the ID and PPID/ID groups, respectively, whereas the PPID and healthy control groups both had ERP at 8 weeks. Statistical analysis found no significant differences in egg count levels between groups during the study. The expected ERP for ivermectin is 8–10 weeks, meaning that two of the groups displayed shortened ERPs. However, due to the small group sizes, these data should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, results do indicate a need for further investigation of the possible influence of endocrine disorders on anthelmintic performance in horses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: During the late Miocene and early Pliocene (latest Hemphillian, Hh4 interval, 5.7 to 4.75 Ma) a distinctive suite of four species of extinct horses (Family Equidae) were widespread in North America. This includes Nannippus aztecus, Neohipparion eurystyle, Astrohippus stocki, and Dinohippus mexicanus. In Florida, two additional equid species, Pseudhipparion simpsoni and Cormohipparion emsliei, are also typically found at Hh4 localities. Here we compare horses from four Hh4 Florida fossil sites, including three from the Bone Valley mines and a fourth from the recently discovered Montbrook site. Two of these sites have all six expected species, one has five species, and one has only four species present. To explain these differences, we used species counts from research databases and rarefaction simulation to clarify the relative abundances, species richness, and occurrences of these horses from these four sites. The Palmetto Mine (Agrico) site, with five equid species, appears to lack the sixth species owing to ecological reasons. This is different from Montbrook, the site with only four of the six species. Results indicate that Montbrook is likely lacking two missing equid species for a couple of reasons: sampling bias and biological/ecological causes. Our results demonstrate that sampling biases can account for observed equid species richness when the overall abundance of certain equid species is low. Nevertheless, other factors, including ecology and with sufficient resolution, perhaps also time, may also explain the distribution and occurrences of individual species at these and other fossil sites. In a broader perspective, analyses such as this example provide an opportunity to address a persistent challenge in paleontology, that is, how do we explain absences of extinct taxa from the fossil record? © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The present paper deals with the archaeozoological investigation carried out on a horse skeleton discovered in a Late Iron Age La Tène tomb (coded CX 143) in Alba Iulia, Romania. The paper presents all the results of the investigation, with a description of finds, adding a detailed assessment of the dentition with some interesting conclusions on the usage of a horse bit and the possible consequences of this use. The morphological features of the horse indicate a 7–8-year-old male individual, with a recalculated height of 1200–1300 mm. What is also stressed in the investigated sample is the lack of the characteristic pathological lesions typical for horseback riding but showing distinctive elements of bit wear. A comparative perspective over the few findings from the same period is provided to ensure the framing of the identified individual into the much larger historical context. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: Vasovagal tonus index (VVTI) serves as a straightforward assessment tool for autonomic function during both physiological and pathological conditions, including pregnancy, in horses. Obtaining VVTI through a modified base apex lead system could be a practical and comfortable solution. In this study, we assessed VVTI in horses with respect to training status and electrocardiographic measurements utilizing a novel modified base apex lead technique. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 Thai native crossbred horses and 12 Arabian horses, all free of cardiac abnormalities, were enrolled in the study. Animals underwent electrocardiogram (ECG) and VVTI using both the base-apex lead method and its modified version. 25 mm/s and 10 mm/mV ECG recordings provided standard bipolar limb leads. The amplitudes and durations of P waves, QRS complexes, PR interval, QT interval, and T duration were assessed. The T wave’s shape was examined. Each recording’s R-R interval was utilized to assess heart rate. Twenty consecutive beats were used to compute the variability of heart rate (VVTI). Results: The P wave amplitude was the only significant difference (p < 0.05) between the base apex lead method and the modified base apex lead method, with no variations in heart rate, P duration, PR interval, T duration, and QRS duration and amplitude. Both methods showed mainly biphasic T wave patterns. The VVTI values of all horses did not differ significantly between the base apex and modified base apex methods. There was no significant difference in VVTI between Thai crossbred horses and Arabian horses in either method. Conclusion: This study provided the first evidence that VVTI can be evaluated using the modified base apex lead system and may be useful for cardiovascular function monitoring in horses.

ABSTRACT: The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was developed to facilitate the identification of musculoskeletal pain. The aim of the current study was to collate behavioural data using the RHpE from horses at competitions assumed by their owners and/or riders to be fit for competition. The objectives were to quantify the frequency of occurrence of behaviours in pain-free horses and those with lameness or abnormalities of canter and to determine any differences between disciplines and levels of competition. The RHpE was applied to 1358 horses competing in Grand Prix (GP) dressage (n = 211), 5* three-day events (TDE) (n = 137), or low-level one-day events (ODE) (n = 1010). The median RHpE score for all horses was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 2, 5; range 0, 12) and the median lameness grade was 0 (IQR 0, 1; range 0, 4). The Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s test for pairwise comparisons, found a difference in median RHpE scores between low-level ODE and GP dressage (p = 0.001), but not between 5* TDE and low-level ODE (p = 0.09) or between GP dressage and 5* TDE (p = 1.00). The median RHpE score was highest for low-level ODE. The Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test identified a significant difference in prevalence of most of the 24 behaviours of the RHpE in non-lame compared with lame horses. Recognition of the behaviours of non-lame horses may improve equine welfare and performance, and rider comfort, confidence, and safety. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To assess the repeatability of infrared thermometer temperature readings and evaluate the correlation between digital rectal temperature and infrared thermometer temperatures taken at different locations in healthy afebrile horses. ANIMALS 101 afebrile horses ≥ 1 year old. METHODS Digital rectal temperatures and infrared temperatures from the eye, gingiva, neck, axilla, and perineum were obtained in a climate-controlled environment and at 2 outdoor ambient temperatures (study period, November 1, 2021, to April 30, 2023). RESULTS Infrared temperature measurements were well tolerated by horses, including those resistant to rectal temperature. There was significant correlation between rectal temperature and infrared temperature taken at the perineum (R = 0.57; P < .001) and eye (R = 0.37; P < .001). Infrared temperature measurements were highly repeatable, allowing for calculation of reference ranges for the perineum (36.0 to 37.8°C) and eye (35.7 to 37.1°C) in climate-controlled conditions. There was increased variance in outside temperatures compared to climate-controlled conditions for the eye (P = .002), gingiva (P = .047), and perineum (P = .005). CLINICAL RELEVANCE While infrared thermometer temperatures were not numerically the same as rectal temperature using a digital thermometer, measurements at the perineum and eye were correlated with rectal temperature readings. Further, the repeatability of infrared readings allows for computation of reference ranges that make the infrared thermometer a viable alternative for the practicing veterinarian when obtaining a temperature in uncooperative horses. The infrared thermometer was reliable outdoors for the eye, but not the perineum. Additional validation of infrared temperature reference ranges in febrile horses and warmer ambient temperatures is warranted. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The present research aimed to characterize the genetic diversity and relationships among extant Arabian horse sire lines in Bulgaria, using 15 equine microsatellite markers. The evaluation included 537 Arabian horses representing nine sire lines (SAKLAWI I, LATIF, SEANDERICH, IBRAHIM, SHABAB, DJEBEL MOUSA, KUHAILAN AFAS, BAIRACTAR, and SARHAN). The obtained results indicated that within these lines, the mean number of alleles ranged from 4.15 in SARHAN to 5.54 in SAKLAWI I and LATIF. The mean expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.54 in the SEANDERICH line to 0.67 in SAKLAWI I. The inbreeding coefficient for the entire Arabian populations was rather low: FIS = −0.109, fluctuating from −0.204 in SHABAB to −0.041 in SAKLAWI I. The mean genetic differentiation, FST, was 0.096, demonstrating that nearly 90% of the total genetic variation was due to genetic differentiation within each population. STRUCTURE analysis indicated a genetic similarity between SHABAB and LATIF, between IBRAHIM and KUHAILAN AFAS, as well as between SAKLAWI I, SEANDERICH, and BAIRACTAR. This study of the genetic diversity of Arabian sire lines in Bulgaria can assist in developing a national strategy for the exclusion of non-purebred animals from breeding programs in order to preserve the genetic profile of the original Arabian lines. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent one of the most commonly used classes of drugs in both human and veterinary medicine. However, many clinical side effects have been observed, especially when treatment has been prolonged. While the anti-inflammatory efficacy and safety of repeated administration of firocoxib (Previcox®), which is a selective NSAID COX-2 inhibitor, has been evaluated for short-term use (one to fourteen days), its clinical relevance for longer-term use is not known. As a preliminary study, healthy, adult male and female horses (n = 7) were treated with firocoxib for 40 days concomitant with the collection of blood samples encompassing treatment to assess hematological and biochemical endpoints. Daily oral administration of firocoxib was performed with one 57 mg tablet/animal (0.11–0.14 mg/kg), which was crushed and mixed with feed. Blood samples were collected one day before treatment (D0 or basal sample), during (D10, D20, D30, and D40), and after treatment (D55 and D70). Results indicated some hematological and biochemical effects were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) towards the end of treatment on D40 relative to pre-treatment or baseline values on D0. Post-treatment, all values returned to pre-treatment values within 30 days without any apparent clinical adversities. In conclusion, while these preliminary results are favorable for prolonged use of firocoxib in horses, future studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of prolonged use accompanied with other clinically relevant endpoints in healthy as well as injured or diseased animals. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Several tooth extraction techniques are described in equine literature, and oral extraction techniques in standing sedated horses are popular among equine practitioners. The objectives of this study were to develop the corkscrew technique for cheek tooth extraction (CSET) in equine cadaver heads and evaluate this technique in clinical cases. We hypothesized that the CSET could be performed safely to extract cheek teeth in standing sedated horses. First, the CSET was attempted and developed in eight equine cadaver heads. Second, the CSET was performed in clinical cases between 2016 and 2020, and the following information was recorded: diagnosis, affected tooth, procedure duration, intraoperative difficulties, tooth size, postoperative complications, medication, hospitalization time, and 1-year follow-up. Sixteen CSET procedures were performed in eight equine skulls with a 75% success rate. In 24 clinical cases, 25 CSET procedures were attempted to extract 22 superior and 3 inferior cheek teeth. CSET was successful in 76% of procedures. Fractures of the tooth and stripping of screw threads were the major complications that led to the failure of CSET. CSET is a viable and safe technique to extract cheek teeth in standing sedated horses. Longitudinal drilling is a must for this technique to be successful. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is the most common endocrine disorder of older horses. Immune dysfunction in horses with PPID could increase susceptibility to infectious diseases, including strongyle infections; however, few data are available. The aim of this study was to determine if horses with PPID had increased strongyle faecal egg counts (FEC) compared with control horses, over a fourteen-week period in Victoria, Australia. Clinical signs and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were used to categorise horses into PPID (n=14) or control (n=31) groups. Faecal samples were collected for FEC determination prior to anthelmintic treatment, and fortnightly post-treatment for each horse. Generalised linear mixed modelling, using a gamma distribution, was used to compare differences between groups in the repeated measures study. The confounding variable of age was controlled for as a fixed effect. Following anthelmintic treatment, mean FEC was greater for the PPID group compared to the control group on day 56 (405 ± 756 eggs per gram [EPG] vs 40 ± 85 EPG, p=0.05) and day 70 (753 ±1598 EPG vs 82 ±141 EPG, p=0.04). There were no differences in mean FEC between groups on days 84 and 98. Cumulative FEC (day 14 to day 98) was significantly greater for the PPID horses than control horses (2118 ± 4016 EPG vs 798 ± 768 EPG, p<0.0001). Group egg reappearance period was shorter for PPID horses (day 56 post-anthelmintic treatment) compared to control horses (day 70) and 30% of the PPID horses reached a FEC threshold of >200 EPG on day 42, compared to 0% of control horses (p=0.02). These results suggest that the rate of a re-established patent infection between groups could be different due to a comprised immune response in PPID horses or differences in the host-parasite relationship regarding encysted stage larvae. However, despite differences between groups, some horses with PPID consistently had no detectable or low FEC (<200 EPG) during the study period. These findings highlight the importance of individual FEC monitoring to determine if anthelmintic treatment is required, in line with sustainable parasite management practices. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Client satisfaction depends on the balance between expectations and service experience. Previous research identified seven aspects of equine veterinary professional conduct that are important for client satisfaction: quality of care, quality of service, horsemanship, transfer of knowledge, financial aspects, interpersonal skills and professionalism. Methods: By employing a cross-sectional study design through a survey-based investigation, horse owners' initial contact preferences and their perceptions of the importance of various aspects of veterinary care in different scenarios were explored. Categories included professional versus amateur and competitive versus non-competitive horse owners. Quantitative data analysis was performed. Results: Data from 1153 participants revealed that horse owners promptly contacted veterinarians for colic (92.7%) but delayed for lameness (51.8%) and pre-purchase examinations (63.0%). Overall, quality of care emerged as the most important aspect of veterinary care for horse owners, with financial aspects considered least important. Competitive and professional horse owners prioritised financial aspects and professionalism, whereas non-professional and non-competitive horse owners prioritised quality of care and interpersonal skills (p < 0.005). Limitations: Survey distribution relied on a snowball effect, internet access was necessary and the study exclusively represents the Western equine community. Potential bias should be acknowledged. Conclusion: The perceived importance of various aspects of veterinary care varies depending on the nature of the consultation and the horse owner type. Tailoring veterinary services can improve client satisfaction by aligning with diverse expectations. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the effect of a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone on the risk of postoperative reflux (POR) in horses undergoing small intestinal surgery and to investigate its association with incisional complications and short-term survival. Design: Retrospective cohort study over an 11-year period (2008–2019). Setting: UK-based private referral center. Animals: Two hundred and forty client-owned horses >6 months of age undergoing exploratory laparotomy for treatment of a small intestinal lesion. Interventions: Ninety-seven horses received a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg, IV). Measurements and Main Results: Of 97 horses that received dexamethasone, 52 (53.6%) required small intestinal resection. Of 143 horses that did not receive dexamethasone, small intestinal resection was performed in 78 (54.5%). A total of 70 horses (29%) developed POR. There was no difference in the risk of POR between horses that received dexamethasone (25/97; 26%) and those that did not (45/143; 31%, P = 0.34). Risk factors associated with the development of POR included small intestinal resection (odds ratio [OR]: 4.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.27–9.11, P < 0.001), a PCV >40% 24 hours postoperatively (OR: 4.11, 95% CI: 2–8.45, P < 0.001), and a WBC count >10 × 109/L on admission (OR: 3.29, 95% CI: 1.47–7.41, P = 0.004). Dexamethasone was not associated with the odds of POR. Horses undergoing repeat laparotomy had a higher risk of incisional infection (OR: 8.07, 95% CI: 1.98–32.81, P = 0.004). Dexamethasone administration was not associated with incisional infection. The development of POR was negatively associated with short-term survival (OR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03–0.17, P ≤ 0.001). Dexamethasone administration was not retained in the final multivariable model for survival. Conclusions: Intraoperative dexamethasone was not associated with the development of POR in this study population, nor did it have an effect on postoperative survival or incisional infection in horses undergoing surgical management of small intestinal disease. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Registered (equine) veterinary nurses (R(E)VNs) typically provide few client-facing services. Better utilising R(E)VN skills could help address workforce shortages, improve morale and benefit patient health. The aim of this study was to explore horse owner perceptions of R(E)VN roles. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey of horse owners gathered data on their understanding of R(E)VN roles, their experiences of R(E)VNs their openness to further R(E)VN services and perceived facilitators of and barriers to such services. Participants were recruited via practices, social media and snowball sampling. Descriptive analysis of the quantitative data and manifest content analysis of the qualitative data were conducted. Results: Three hundred and forty-seven useable responses were received. Eighty-one percent (282/347) had heard the term R(E)VN. Most talked positively about their experiences with R(E)VNs. Eighty-seven percent (285/326) were open to an R(E)VN visiting their horse under the direction of a veterinary surgeon, with more than 90% being extremely or somewhat comfortable with R(E)VN visits for bandaging and suture removal. Limitations: It is unclear how closely respondents' perceptions reflect those of the wider UK horse owner population. Conclusions: Horse owners appear to be open to further nursing services, with key procedures such as bandaging being a potential starting point. Understanding the career goals of the individual nurses and the needs of the practice will be key to the successful implementation of these services. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The welfare of unwanted horses presents a significant concern for the equine industry. However, there is a lack of research on how unwanted horses are affected by major crises. The drastic changes that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic presented ample opportunity to investigate how unwanted horses are impacted by challenging circumstances. Study objectives were to evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the unwanted horse population and determine the current perceptions of horses in-transition. A 23-question online survey designed using QualtricsTM was administered electronically to adults living in the United States. Questions pertained to effects on equine ownership, equine management, event participation, and perceptions of unwanted horses. Frequency analysis combined with Chi-squared analyses and analyses of variance identified the impacts of COVID-19 on horse owners, non-horse owners, and equine professionals. From survey results, equine ownership, management practices, and time spent with horses proved to be unaffected (P < 0.001) by the coronavirus pandemic. A decreased ability to participate in equine events was evident across all groups (P ≤ 0.03). Financial hardship, unmanageable behavior, and injury were cited as leading causes for horses becoming "in-transition." Euthanasia was the transitioning method perceived as most accessible, while donation to an equine program was least accessible. Based on results, the COVID-19 pandemic had negligible impact on the number of unwanted horses in the United States. Long-term effects of COVID-19 on equine ownership and management decisions should be considered to provide a deeper base of knowledge for how major crises affect the horse in-transition population. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Cyathostomins are globally important equine parasites, responsible for both chronic and acute pathogenic effects. The occurrence of mixed infections with numerous cyathostomin species hinders our understanding of parasite epidemiology, host-parasite dynamics, and species pathogenicity. There have been few studies of cyathostomin species occurring in horses in Ireland, where temperate climatic conditions with year-round rainfall provide suitable conditions for infection of grazing animals with bursate nematodes. Here, we amplified and sequenced the ITS-2 region of adult worms harvested at post-mortem from eleven adult horses between August 2018 and June 2020, and recorded species prevalence and abundance of worms recovered from the caecum, right ventral colon and left dorsal colon, using both BLAST and IDTAXA for taxonomic attribution. Phylogenetic relationships and community composition were also recorded and compared with other relevant studies, including a global meta-analysis. Overall, our results agree with previous studies that there does not seem to be a major difference in cyathostomin species occurrence in equids in different geographical regions. We confirmed the results of other workers in relation to the difficulties in discriminating between Cylicostephanus calicatus and Coronocyclus coronatus on the basis of ITS-2 sequences. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG) currently advocates for a transition towards single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers as a potential alternative for equine parentage verification. To ascertain the efficacy of this transition, it is imperative to evaluate the performance of parentage testing using SNPs in juxtaposition with short tandem repeats (STRs). As per ISAG's recommendation, we used an equine genotyping-by-sequencing panel with 144 SNPs for this purpose. Equine parentage is currently realized using 16 microsatellites (STRs) excluding the LEX3 marker. In this study, 1074 horses were genotyped using the 144 SNPs panel, including 432 foals, 414 mares, and 228 stallions, from five different breeds: 293 Arabians, 167 Barbs, 189 Thoroughbreds, 73 Anglo-Arabians, and 352 Arabian-Barbs. As a result, two SNPs markers were eliminated from the panel system due to inconsistent amplification across all examined individuals leaving 142 SNPs markers for analysis. A comparative analysis between SNPs and STRs markers revealed that the mean expected heterozygosity was 0.457 for SNPs and 0.76 for STRs, while the mean observed heterozygosity stood at 0.472 for SNPs and 0.72 for STRs. Furthermore, the probability of identity was calculated to be 5.722 × 10−57 for SNPs and 1.25 × 10−15 for STRs markers. In alignment with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in polyploids test, 110 out of the total SNPs were consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in polyploids test (p > 0.05). Employing both SNPs and STRs markers, the mean polymorphic information content was discerned to be 0.351 for SNPs and 0.72 for STRs. The cumulative exclusion probabilities for SNP markers exceeded 99.99%, indicating that the 142 SNPs panel might be adequate for parentage testing. In contrast, when utilizing STRs markers, the combined average exclusion probabilities for one and both parents were determined to be 99.8% and 99.9%, respectively. Our comprehensive study underscores the potential of SNPs in equine parentage verification, especially when compared to STRs in terms of exclusion probabilities. As a corollary, the application of SNPs for parentage verification and identification can significantly contribute to the conservation initiative for the five Moroccan horse breeds. Nonetheless, further research is required to address and replace the deficient SNPs within the panel. © 2024 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.

ABSTRACT: (1) The main goals of general anesthesia include pain management and a safe anesthetic protocol for smooth recovery. In this retrospective study, we compared two anesthetic protocols for general anesthesia with isoflurane during emergency laparotomy: sedation with xylazine and the intraoperative infusion of lidocaine (X group) versus medetomidine as a preoperative sedation and intraoperative infusion (M group). (2) The medical records of horses who underwent emergency laparotomies between 2016 and 2023 were reviewed. According to the anesthetic protocol, patients were allocated to the X or M groups. Data about the horse, signalment, history, and anesthetic variables were analyzed. (3) Group X had a significantly higher heart rate (HR), lower respiratory rate (RR) and mean and diastolic arterial pressure (MAP/DAP). A progressive increase in HR and RR was observed in both groups. Group X underwent a decrease in RR and an increase in DAP. In Group M, a decrease in MAP and DAP was observed. Group M exhibited a longer recovery time with similar recovery scores. Both protocols provided safe anesthesia for emergency laparotomy, with minor cardiovascular and respiratory depression. Minor respiratory depression was detected when xylazine was used, while recovery was longer with medetomidine. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Athletic horses are usually retired from equestrian competition at an advanced age. Aged horses may then continue to have regular exercise or are sedentary. The comparison of autonomic regulation between sedentary aged horses (SAH) and trained aged horses (TAH) after retirement remains unpublished. This study compared daily heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability between 11 SAH and 11 TAH over 22 h (07.00 h to 05.00 h on an alternate day) and during the day and night. An increase in mean beat-to-beat (RR) intervals (p < 0.01-0.0001) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) index (p < 0.05-0.0001), corresponding to the decreased HR and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) index (p < 0.01-0.0001), was observed at night. Compared to SAH, lowered mean HR and SNS index, corresponding to elevated mean RR intervals and very-low-frequency bands, were marked in TAH during the day (p < 0.05 for all variables). Whereas the standard deviation of the RR intervals index was higher in TAH than in SAH during the day and night (p < 0.05 for both periods). It was suggested that aged horses with different physical activities revealed distinct autonomic responses. TAH demonstrated higher HRV than SAH during the day. A decreased HR in TAH is prone to result from a reduced SNS role, leading to a shift toward more PNS activity during the day. More research is warranted to determine to what extent the autonomic regulation is modulated by accompanying higher exercise volume or programmed exercise in aged horses. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Negative affect appears to mediate animals’ attention to competing emotional stimuli (e.g., threatening vs. non-threatening conspecific face images), similarly to anxiety-related enhanced attention to social threat reported in humans. To investigate this ‘attention bias’ (AB, i.e., the differential attention allocation to certain types of information over others) in horses, we developed a visual AB test assessing horses’ attention towards image pairs showing unfamiliar conspecifics’ facial expressions indicating, a) negative (social threat), b) more neutral (at rest), and c) positive (food anticipation) situations. We predicted that horses exhibit greater attention to negative compared to neutral or positive face images (as a normal adaptive response), and that horses in negative affective states (inferred from validated welfare indices comprising direct (health, behaviour) and indirect (housing, management) measures summarised as individual welfare scores and subscores reflecting health, social and environmental aspects) show greater AB to negative face stimuli and all images overall. Comparing AB to positive versus neutral social stimuli is rarely considered in AB studies, we therefore explored horses’ AB responses without a priori predictions. Over six trials, 44 horses from three facilities were shown stimulus pairs (negative/neutral, negative/positive, positive/neutral) presented simultaneously on two projector screens. Attention was assessed as absolute attention duration to each image, the proportion of time the negative/positive stimulus was attended to relative to the other stimulus, and overall attention (i.e., duration of head turns towards both stimuli combined). AB to stimulus type, side, effects of facility and individual characteristics (welfare and subscores, age) was analysed using linear and generalised mixed-effect models. Against our predictions, horses attended to the images within the three stimulus pairs for similar lengths of time (negative-neutral: W=1870.5, p=0.2572; negative-positive: W=2542.5, p=0.9296; positive-neutral: W=1762.5, p=0.1019). Due to Covid-19 interruptions, our sample size was lower than our estimated required number (N=113). Still, lower welfare (X2=4.71, p=0.03) and health scores (X2=4.13, p=0.04) significantly predicted shorter attention to the negative face stimuli, possibly reflecting threat avoidance previously reported in other animals. We found significant facility effects on overall attention to the stimuli (X2=77.42, p<0.001), likely due to varying yard-specific conditions (e.g., lighting, noise). This highlights that external influences on visual attention require consideration when conducting cognitive tests at different testing sites. Further methodological investigation (e.g., test cue suitability, perceptual processing of computer-generated images; test stimuli familiarity; individual differences) is needed to evaluate the potential of AB as an indicator of affective valence in horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: Colic is the primary problem affecting equestrian care worldwide. The primary cause of colic is digestive diseases; however, they can also affect organs from different systems in the abdominal region. In addition to a prior history of the disease and its treatment, risk factors may be assessed to determine the etiology of the disease in horses without or with a history of colic. This study aimed to present a summary of the incidence, risk factors, and medical procedures for colic in horses. Materials and Methods: Based on owner reports, 223 horses in Tuban, Indonesia, suspected of having colic were investigated. During the investigation of clinical parameters, investigators went door-to-door with interested horse owners to gather information about potential risk factors related to equine colic. Information on horses diagnosed with colic was obtained from the medical records of treatment. A Chi-square test was used to investigate the potential association between the risk factors, medical protocol, and the outcome of colic in horses. Results: Of the 187 cases, spasmodic colic was the most common (48.13%), but 17 (9.09%) had no definitive diagnosis. Poor body condition scores (χ2 = 58.73; p < 0.001), wheat bran feeding (χ2 = 26.79; p < 0.001), concentrate (χ2 = 10.66; p < 0.01), less access to water (χ2 = 128.24; p < 0.001), recurrence of colic (χ2 = 85.64; p < 0.001), no deworming program (χ2 = 54.76; p < 0.001), the presence of gastrointestinal parasites (χ2 = 56.79; p < 0.001), stressed physical activity (χ2 = 28.53; p < 0.001), and summer season (χ2 = 7.83; p < 0.01) were the risk factors for colic. We further reported that 185 (98.93%) patients who received the following medical interventions recovered: injection of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was necessary, Vitamin B complex (χ2 = 39.98; p < 0.001), fluid therapy (χ2 = 92.99; p < 0.001), and gastric intubation (χ2 = 4.09; p < 0.05). Conclusion: The importance of colic was demonstrated in 187 (83.86%) of the 223 horses investigated in Tuban, Indonesia, documented. In this study, recommendations for medical procedures when colic risk factors have been determined are presented. © 2024 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Testicular development and spermatogenesis are tightly regulated by both coding and non-coding genes, with mRNA and lncRNA playing crucial roles in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. However, there are significant differences in regulatory mechanisms before and after sexual maturity. Nevertheless, the mRNAs and lncRNAs in the testes of Mongolian horses have not been systematically identified. In this study, we first identified the testicular tissues of sexually immature and sexually mature Mongolian horses at the tissue and protein levels, and comprehensively analyzed the expression profiles of mRNA and lncRNA in the testes of 1-year-old (12 months, n = 3) and 10-year-old (n = 3) Mongolian horses using RNA sequencing technology. Through gene expression analysis, we identified 16,582 mRNAs and 2128 unknown lncRNAs that are commonly expressed in both sexually immature and sexually mature Mongolian horses. Meanwhile, 9217 mRNAs (p < 0.05) and 2191 unknown lncRNAs (p < 0.05) were identified as differentially expressed between the two stages, which were further validated by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The analysis results showed that genes in the sexually immature stage were mainly enriched in terms related to cellular infrastructure, while genes in the sexually mature stage were enriched in terms associated with hormones, metabolism, and spermatogenesis. In summary, the findings of this study provide valuable resources for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying testicular development and spermatogenesis in Mongolian horses and offer new perspectives for future related research. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The reconstruction of past life based on archaeozoology is a challenging domain that offers a range of valuable details concerning former human and animal populations. Additionally, the ancient era is a source of information for human and veterinary medicine, as well as for other biological sciences. This report highlights a pathological lesion identified during the investigation of a horse skeleton from a pit dated La Tène in Alba County (Romania). The left scapula with lesions was collected from the skeleton of a buried 7–8-year-old male horse. The aforementioned bone underwent gross, radiological, and computerized tomography evaluation. Macroscopically, a collar of supraarticular cancellous hyperostosis was detected, most likely as a consequence of an invasive chronic phlegmonous periarthritis and/or bursitis of the infraspinate muscle following probably a penetrating cutaneous wound in the shoulder region. A suppurative periarthritis\bursitis of the infraspinate muscle situated nearby caused, apparently, supraglenoidian periosteitis responsible for osteophytes and exostoses formation in the neck region of the scapula. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horse gram yellow mosaic disease (HgYMD) is one of the major limiting factor for legumes production in India as it can cause economic loss up to 100%. Till date, horse gram yellow mosaic virus was rare to infect french bean, but now-a-days, it has become the major causal agent for yellow mosaic epidemics in the southern part of India. Few bush type varieties, resistant to yellow mosaic disease are released but not specifically resistant to HgYMD. So, systemic breeding work has been initiated to identify the resistant source for HgYMD in french bean. Methods: Seventyone genotypes of french bean were screened in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications under natural epiphytotic as well as artificial condition during Summer, 2018 at ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru, India. Result: The genotypes varied for percent disease index (PDI), area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the apparent rate of infection per unit time period (r). Two varieties i.e., Jade-5058 and Arka Arjun were showing less PDI of 13.33 and 14.44, least average rate of infection of 0.64 and 0.65 and lowest AUDPC value of 350.54 and 359.16 respectively, compared to other genotypes. Average PDI of Arka Arjun and Jade-5058 were 13.33 and 12.22 under artificial screening, which were much lesser than susceptible check Arka Komal (PDI 92.22) and Arka Anoop (PDI 90.00). Resistant genotypes identified from this experiment can be used for breeding HgYMD resistant french bean lines. © 2024, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is limited evidence on factors affecting critical decision making for horses with colic. This study's aim was to describe the assessment and decision making involved in horses referred for management of colic. Methods: An in-depth case analysis was used to document case presentation, decision making and outcomes for horses referred for colic to two UK equine veterinary practices over a 12-month period. The data recorded included previous history, presenting signs, response to treatment, case outcome and factors affecting decisions for further treatment or euthanasia. Results: Data were available for 60 cases: 55 were hospitalised for medical or surgical treatment and five horses were euthanased following initial assessment. The main factors affecting treatment decisions were severity of clinical signs (80%, 47/59), financial concerns (10%, 6/59) and ongoing health issues or previous history of colic (5%, 3/59). Factors associated with euthanasia decisions were postoperative complications (5/18), poor prognosis (4/18), deteriorating clinical signs (3/18) and financial concerns (3/18). Limitation: The limited study population may affect the extent to which the findings can be generalised. Conclusion: The severity of clinical signs was the key factor in treatment decision making. The main factors affecting euthanasia decisions were clinical deterioration, poor prognosis and financial constraints. These findings should be incorporated into clinical case recording to capture the multifactorial nature of decision making. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This literature review analyzes the historical development of polo, its organizational structure, the course of the game, as well as the breeding, rearing, and training practices of polo horses. Frequently occurring ailments, such as musculoskeletal injuries, respiratory diseases, and internal illnesses, are highlighted. Lameness is a major problem, with injuries to the superficial digital flexor tendon being the most common cause. Other notable diseases include exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), myositis, rhabdomyolysis, and equine infectious anemia (EIA). To ensure the welfare of polo horses, effective prevention and management strategies are crucial. These include proper training, the adaptation of the ground surface, appropriate shoeing, and compliance with animal welfare guidelines and association rules. Collaboration between associations, players, organizers, and veterinarians is crucial. Promoting responsible management practices and raising awareness among stakeholders can help ensure that polo continues to thrive while maintaining high animal welfare standards. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The equine industry is an essential source of job and income worldwide. The use of artificial insemination (AI) with frozen semen is an opportunity to continue disseminating the Colombian Criollo horse. Seminal cryopreservation studies in Colombian Criollo horses are limited, and there is no previous knowledge in deleterious changes induced by the cryopreservation process on the chromatin integrity of the spermatic cells. The present study aimed to verify the effect of the modified-INRA 82 and Botucrio® extenders on sperm kinematics, chromatin integrity, and morphology of cryopreserved Colombian Criollo sperm. Five ejaculates of five stallions were obtained, split into two samples, and frozen with two different extenders (modified-INRA 82 and Botucrio) and cooling curves. After freezing, samples were analysed with the CASA system. Sperm morphology, chromatin integrity, hypoosmotic, and thermoresistance tests were performed. Data were analysed by MANOVA (parametrical variables) and Kruskal Wallis (non-parametrical variables) with SAS Studio ® software. Statistically significant differences (P≤0.05) were found for the progressive motility (14 ± 5 and 27 ± 13), and chromatin integrity (64 ± 3 and 69 ± 5) for modified-INRA 82 and Botucrio, respectively. Botucrio samples presented higher total motility at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min and progressive motility at 60, 90, 120 min in thermoresistance test than modified-INRA 82. Botucrio and modifiedINRA 82, are capable to conserve effectively equine semen from Colombian Criollo horses. However, Botucrio permitted an improved kinematics and higher chromatin integrity than modified-INRA 82. © 2024, Trakia University. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Overriding spinous processes, also known as ‘kissing spines’, are one of the most common causes of back pain in horses. The aim of this study was to investigate which options for diagnosis and treatment are preferred by equine orthopaedic specialists and assess which techniques are used for local injection. Methods: An online survey was distributed among members of the European/American College of Veterinary Surgeons, the European/American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, the International Society of Equine Locomotor Pathology and nationally recognised advanced equine orthopaedic practitioners. Results: The survey was completed by 353 respondents. The injection techniques most commonly used involve placing two needles abaxial to the interspinous space (42%) under ultrasonographic guidance (32%) or one needle in the midline (35%) between two spinous processes. The most popular combination for overriding dorsal spinous process therapy was local injection (26.7%) combined with controlled exercise (25.5%). Manual therapy was considered by 42% of European and 25% of American specialists (p = 0.01). Surgical intervention as a first-line treatment was recommended mainly by specialists working in the United States, the UK or Ireland (p = 0.001). Overall, most equine orthopaedic veterinarians (71%; n = 201) preferred conservative management and recommended surgery only for horses that did not respond to conservative therapy. Limitations: Respondents’ personal bias may have skewed the findings. Conclusions: Despite a growing body of evidence, the therapeutic approach to ‘kissing spines’ in horses is influenced by professional specialisation and regional preferences. Variations in injection techniques and differing criteria for surgical intervention warrant further investigation. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to determine whether heat acclimation could induce adaptations in exercise performance, thermoregulation, and the expression of proteins associated with heat stress in the skeletal muscles of Thoroughbreds. Thirteen trained Thoroughbreds performed 3 weeks of training protocols, consisting of cantering at 90% maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for 2 min 2 days/week and cantering at 7 m/s for 3 min 1 day/week, followed by a 20-min walk in either a control group (CON; Wet Bulb Globe Temperature [WBGT] 12–13°C; n = 6) or a heat acclimation group (HA; WBGT 29–30°C; n = 7). Before and after heat acclimation, standardized exercise tests (SET) were conducted, cantering at 7 m/s for 90 s and at 115% VO2max until fatigue in hot conditions. Increases in run time (p = 0.0301), peak cardiac output (p = 0.0248), and peak stroke volume (p = 0.0113) were greater in HA than in CON. Pulmonary artery temperature at 7 m/s was lower in HA than in CON (p = 0.0332). The expression of heat shock protein 70 (p = 0.0201) and 90 (p = 0.0167) increased in HA, but not in CON. These results suggest that heat acclimation elicits improvements in exercise performance and thermoregulation under hot conditions, with a protective adaptation to heat stress in equine skeletal muscles. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Pollution of water resources has recently increased as a result of expanded industrial activity. Recycling waste biomass into bio-adsorbent material offers a cheap, easy, and eco-friendly solution. In this study, magnetic carbon nanofibers (MCNF) with a highly porous structure were developed from magnetite-preloaded horse manure by hydrothermal treatment followed by carbonization using different ratios of iron (III) nitrate and iron oxide as magnetic precursors. The produced MCNF had a very porous structure with specific surface area of 435.31 m2/g and high carbon content. The magnetic characteristics of MCNF promoted by the presence of iron oxide species. The saturated magnetization of MCNF obtained from a 5:5 ratio of the magnetic precursors (iron (III) nitrate: iron oxide) was 2.48 emu/g. Synthesized MCNF was applied as a bio-adsorbent for methylene blue (MB) removal from aqueous solution, with results showing excellent dye adsorption of 92–99 %. MB adsorption was facilitated by pore filling, electrostatic contact, hydrogen bonding, and ion complexation. Experimental results indicated that the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models concurred with the observed MB adsorption data, suggesting that the adsorption mechanism involved multilayered micropore interactions between magnetite and MB chemisorption. The resulting magnetic adsorbent was successfully removed from the aqueous solution by physical separation. Findings indicated that horse manure-derived MCNF could be used as an efficient bio-adsorbent to remove organic contaminants in wastewater. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: This study evaluates the change in an MRI of the proximal metacarpal region in a group of sport horses that returned to work. This retrospective analysis evaluated 18 limbs represented by 17 horses. Results: The hyperintense signal within the dorsal collagenous part of the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL) on T1W/T2*W GRE sequences decreased or stayed the same in the majority of cases. The hyperintense STIR signal within the dorsal collagenous part of the PSL resolved in the majority of the patients, and the third metacarpal bone (McIII) hyperintense STIR signal resolved in all patients. The dorsal margin irregularity of the PSL stayed the same, and McIII sclerosis and resorption of the palmar margin of McIII stayed the same in the majority of cases. McIII hyperintense STIR signal resolution carries a broad time range, with a mean of 94 days and a range of 47–202 days. Conclusions: Complete normalization of the dorsal collagenous part of the PSL does not appear necessary for a return to soundness, but a resolution of the McIII hyperintense STIR signal is expected for horses returning to soundness. A rescan period of 120 days for the proximal metacarpal region is suggested. In addition, there was no significant change in the size of the PSL between the initial and final MRI. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Point-of-care (POC) glucometry is commonly used in horses; however, measurement error with this method when analysing hypoglycaemic samples (<4 mmol/L) is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the precision and accuracy of glucometry in hypoglycaemic horses in comparison to a laboratory method of glucose measurement (LAB). Repeatability coefficients were 0.47 mmol/L for POC and 0.09 mmol/L for LAB, and coefficients of variation were 10 % and 2.11 %, for the POC and LAB methods, respectively. Systemic bias with the POC method was present, with a mean bias of −0.26 mmol/L (95 % limits of agreement: −0.88 – 0.37) in comparison to LAB, and <70% of measurements were within 20 % of paired LAB results. Prior to use of glucometers, assessment of the diagnostic performance of the equipment is necessary, including determination of acceptable criteria and reference ranges for hypoglycaemic samples. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The diverse origins of biomass wastes provide a constraint on the practical application of pyrolysis, as it leads to uncertain chemical reactions, feedstock conversion, and energy consumption. Various model-fit methods are available to identify the decomposition kinetics, however, limited studies have compared the reliability and accuracy of those kinetic models. This work compared five different kinetic models, two based on model-fit methods (Coats–Redfern (CR), Kennedy-Clark (KC) and three based on the application forms of Criado Master Plots (CMP I, CMP II and CMP III). The mass loss data from the pyrolysis of horse manure (HM) through a thermogravimetric analyser was used as a biomass sample for evaluation. Results demonstrated that all five model-fit methods report different kinetics data. Although the model-fit methods (CR and KC) allow a direct determination of kinetic triplets, the accuracy of data is lower. The CMP-II and CMP-III methods (incorporating model-free data in the model-fit methods) showcase multi-step chemical kinetics and better describe the decomposition behavior of HM due to its multi-compositional properties. To obtain kinetic triplets with enhanced accuracy, it is recommended to incorporate model-free data into the model-fit method. Improved precision of the kinetics data is essential for developing experimental parameters and optimizing the process. Future research should include the selection criteria of model-fit methods shown in this study to improve the accuracy of kinetic data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The color of horse meat may depend on several factors, including storage conditions, animal type and age, as well as meat processing methods. Studies aimed at comparing the color of dry aging and wet aging of horse meat have not been the subject of much scientific research. The purpose of the study is to study the effect of dry and wet aging of horse meat on color. The object of research is a boneless dorsal cut of horse meat. Meat samples were isolated 24 hours after slaughter and stored (2 ± 5 °C) in a dark place. Eight samples of horse meat were cut from a boneless dorsal cut, and then randomly distributed according to the periods and aging method. Two control samples - 1 day, three samples of dry aging – 14, 21, 28 days. Wet aging of horse meat was carried out in vacuum packed form in a refrigerated product storage chamber at a temperature of 2±1 °C and relative humidity of no more than 90% for 28 days. Instrumental color measurements were carried out on the L*, a* and b* scales using a Minolta colorimeter (Minolta CR-400, Osaka, Japan) installed with a D65 illuminator, viewing angle 2°. The differences in the indicator of Lightness L* in meat of dry and wet aging for 14 days were 1,785, at 21 days - 3,784 and 28 days - 10,754, in terms of Redness, a* 11,626 - at 14 days, 13.0841 and 15.1253 were 21 and 28 days, respectively. The difference in Blue, b* was 8.6054, 13.3676, 12.3517 for 14.21 and 28 days. The obtained color differences, ΔE* 17,1346, 21,192, 26,64 indicate that the method of aging of horse meat has a significant effect on its color. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Auscultation of heart sounds is an important veterinary skill requiring an understanding of anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and pattern recognition. This cross-sectional study was developed to evaluate a targeted, audio-visual training resource for veterinary students to improve their understanding and auscultation of common heart conditions in horses. Fourth- and fifth-year 2021 and 2022 Bachelor of Veterinary Science students at the University of Queensland (UQ) were provided the learning resource and surveyed via online pre- and post-intervention surveys. Results were quantitatively analyzed using descriptive statistics and Mann–Whitney U tests. Open-ended survey questions were qualitatively analyzed by thematic analysis and Leximancer™ Version 4 program software analysis. Over the two-year period, 231 fourth-year and 222 fifth-year veterinary students had access to the resource; 89 completed the pre-intervention survey and 57 completed the post-intervention survey. Quantitative results showed the resource helped students prepare for practicals and their perception of competency and confidence when auscultating equine cardiac sounds improved (p < 0.05). Compared to fifth-year students, fourth-year students felt less competent at identifying murmurs and arrythmias prior to accessing the learning resource (p < 0.05). Fourth-year and fifth-year students’ familiarity with detection of murmurs improved after completing the learning resource (p < 0.001). Qualitative analysis demonstrated a limited number of opportunities to practice equine cardiac auscultation throughout the veterinary degree, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that integrated audio-visual resources are an effective means of teaching auscultation. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study, conducted with meticulous scientific rigor, evaluated linear measurements, body proportions, and body indices in Arabian horses better to understand their morphology, aptitude, and biomechanics. The sample comprised 168 adult purebred Arabians (76 males and 92 females) housed in a horse farm in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. Twenty-six linear measurements were made using a measuring tape, from which morphometric indices were calculated. The data was meticulously analyzed using variance analysis and Tukey’s test, with the level of significance set at 5%. The findings of this study, backed by robust statistical analysis, revealed that Arabian horses are geometric, slightly long-limbed (ectomorph), light-working horses and can bear loads equivalent to 25% of their body weight. Longer dorsolumbar, croup, and thigh length than front limb linear measurements suggest body disproportion. Similar findings have been reported in other athletic horse breeds, such as Quarter Horse and Brazilian Sport Horse, as physical exercise requires more propulsion than pleasure riding. Dactylo-thoracic and ability indices place Arabian horses in the light-working horse category, supporting this hypothesis. Some measurements and indices differed between genders, with males exceeding females in most cases, except for body length. Linear measurements proved to be essential tools for movement and conformation assessment. Arabian horses in this sample did not meet riding comfort standards but were thought to have good athletic potential based on linear measurements and proportions. © 2024, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

ABSTRACT: The generation of off-flavor during boiling significantly hampers the acceptability and popularity of the greenfin horse-faced filefish (BFF). Adding perilla to Chinese fish dishes can enhance the flavor of fish. A total of 72 volatile compounds were quantified in BFF with different addition of Perilla polyphenol extract (PPE) (i.e., 0, 0.1 %, 0.3 %, 0.5 %, w: w) by headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). Based on the gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), odor activity value (OAV) and recombination omission testing, (Z)-4-heptenal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, decanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-octenal, (E)-2-nonenal were identified as volatiles contributing to the off-flavor, while linalool and β-ionone exhibited a mitigating effect. Moreover, the antioxidant capacities of PPE assessed through 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) assays, exhibited a positive correlation with perilla polyphenols contents. Orthogonal partial least square discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) results indicated a significant relationship between the off-flavor of BFF and lipid oxidation, adding 0.3% PPE resulted in a marked improvement in flavor profile, with a reduction in off-flavors associated with fishy, oily/fatty and marine, while simultaneously enhancing the freshness, herbal flavors, and overall acceptability of the product. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Context: Racing structure and focus for racehorses differs across jurisdictions and is poorly described. In New Zealand and Australia, jumps racing accounts for a small proportion of total Thoroughbred races each year, as opposed to the larger jumps-racing (National Hunt) industry with purpose-bred horses found in the UK and Ireland. Aims: This study aimed to describe the career profile and pattern of racing for Thoroughbred jumps-racing horses in New Zealand. Methods: Metrics from every horse with a full jumps-racing career (n = 1276, 89% geldings) between the 2005/06 and 2021/22 racing seasons (n = 40,302 starts) were examined. Descriptive statistics, box plots and heat maps were used to describe the data, by using horse age as a proxy for career progression. Key results: Jumps-racing horses had a median of 17 flat starts (IQR 9-30) before their first jumps-racing start. The median career of a jumps-racing horse was 3.7 years (IQR 2.3-5.2) and 29 starts (IQR 16-44). Older horses had a decreasing number of flat-racing starts and an increasing proportion of steeplechase-racing starts. However, the majority of horses still had at least one flat-race start per calendar year, often prior to the first jumps race. Most horses had one spell each season (length 194 days, IQR 124-259), and a condensed preparation length over the winter months, with a median of 14 days (IQR 10-21) between starts. Conclusion: The career pattern for jumps-racing horses in New Zealand reflects the industry retention of horses with a prior career in flat racing into a secondary jumps-racing career. Successful horses have increased focus on preparation for the winter jumps-racing season. Implications: Jumps racing provides a secondary racing career for some flat-racing horses, particularly geldings. This strategy reduces wastage of horses from the industry.  © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Published by CSIRO Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Palmar/plantar annular desmotomy (PAD) is a surgical procedure to mitigate pain, lameness, and other clinical manifestations of annular ligament syndrome. This study aimed to describe a minimally invasive technique for PAD and evaluate potential damage to adjacent structures in 15 cadaveric limbs from sound horses (forelimb = 6 and hindlimb = 9). A 6 USP polyglycolic acid thread was positioned around the palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) on both sides of the limbs through two incisions (proximal and distal to PAL) through the digital sheath and subcutaneous tissue. Kelly forceps, Gerlach or Obwegeser needles were used to thread placement. A back-and-forth motion allowed the thread to cut the ligament until it exited through the proximal skin incision, and the time was registered. The degree of PAL section and tissue injuries were evaluated. The section of the ligament was complete in all limbs. However, 30% (10/30) of the procedures produced iatrogenic injuries on adjacent structures regardless of the instrument used (p > 0.1). There was a higher frequency of lesions in the neurovascular bundle (NVB) on the medial side regardless of the limb (p = 0.068). The odds of injury in the NVB were correlated to side (lateral or medial (p = 0.042) and limb (hind or forelimb) (p = 0.065) by logistic regression. The Gerlach needle had a shorter execution time than the Kelly forceps (p = 0.003). The percutaneous approach to PAD in specimens was practical, quick, and easy to perform. However, this posed a potential chance of iatrogenic trauma to the surrounding tissue. Although they are all reasonable options, the Obwegeser needle was more efficient for applying the thread than the others. © 2024, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

ABSTRACT: Background: Post-anaesthetic fever is a known complication of general anaesthesia, however, its incidence in horses undergoing elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unknown. Objective: To determine the incidence of post-anaesthetic fever in horses undergoing elective orthopaedic MRI and determine whether prophylactic antimicrobial therapy would be associated with a reduction in the incidence of post-anaesthetic fever. We hypothesised that prophylactic antimicrobials would be associated with a reduction in the incidence of post-anaesthetic fever. Study design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: This retrospective study included 791 elective orthopaedic MRIs in systemically healthy horses between June 2006 and March 2020 that recovered from general anaesthesia and did not undergo surgery or intensive medical therapy soon after recovery. Potential factors associated with post-anaesthetic fever were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Case signalment, travel time, preanaesthetic haematology and fibrinogen abnormalities, use of prophylactic antimicrobials, peri-anaesthetic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, anaesthesia time and recovery time were all evaluated for association with post-anaesthetic fever. Results: Of 791 MRI cases, 44 (5.6%) developed a post-anaesthetic fever. Horses that received prophylactic antimicrobials were [odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98–7.46; p ≤ 0.001] more likely to develop a post-anaesthetic fever than those that did not receive antimicrobials. Young horses (1–4 years of age) were (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.26–6.17; p = 0.01) more likely to develop fever compared with adult horses (≥5 years of age). Main limitations: Limitations of this study pertain to retrospective analysis including nonrandomised case selection and incomplete data records. Conclusions: While fever may indicate infection, the majority of early post-anaesthetic fevers resolved before discharge from the hospital with no identified cause. The use of prophylactic antimicrobials to reduce the risk of post-anaesthetic fever for elective MRI is not supported by this study. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report the development of transient Horner's syndrome in horses following local anesthesia of the cervical plexus. Animals: A total of 37 horses. Study design: Observational retrospective short case series. Methods: Medical records of cases undergoing ultrasound-guided cervical plexus anesthesia for standing prosthetic laryngoplasty at a single referral institution were evaluated (2019–2020). Results: Five of 37 horses (14%) developed transient signs of Horner's syndrome postoperatively. Obvious clinical signs began 2 to 5 h following local anesthesia and persisted for two to 4 h. Profuse unilateral sweating of the head and upper neck was the most apparent clinical sign. Conclusion: Transient clinical signs of Horner's syndrome were seen following unilateral local anesthesia of the cervical plexus. Long-term adverse sequelae were not observed. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Information on the management and health of US senior horses (≥15 years of age) is currently limited. Objectives: Provide information on (1) primary use of US senior horses, (2) reasons and risk factors for horse retirement, (3) exercise management, (4) prevalence of low muscle mass and (5) risk factors for, and owner-perceived consequences of, low muscle mass. Study design: Online survey. Methods: Survey responses from 2717 owners of U.S.-resident senior horses (≥15 years of age) were analysed descriptively and inferentially, using ordered and binomial logistic regression, ANOVA and the Kruskal–Wallis test. Results: The most frequently reported primary uses were pleasure riding/driving (38.5%) and full retirement (39.8%). Most horses (61.5%) were retired between 15 and 24 years of age, with health problems being the main reason. Age, female sex, Thoroughbred breed and various medical conditions were identified as risk factors for retirement. In working horses (i.e., those not retired or semi-retired), exercise intensity was negatively associated with age. The owner-reported prevalence of low muscle mass in all horses was 17.2% (95%CI = 15.7–18.7). In those affected by low muscle mass, the ability to work and welfare-related aspects were commonly perceived to be impaired. Increasing age, sex (gelding), pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, osteoarthritis, laminitis and primary use (retired and semi-retired vs. use for competition) were identified as risk factors for owner-reported low muscle mass. Main limitations: Potential response, recall and sampling bias. Causal relationships cannot be established. Conclusions: Although structured exercise into old age may provide health benefits (as seen in elderly people), a large proportion of horses were fully retired in the current study. Senior horses were mainly retired for health problems and characterising these problems may aid in extending their work/active life. Low muscle mass was perceived to affect horses' welfare and ability to work, and identification of prevention and treatment strategies is therefore warranted. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Tabanidae (Diptera), popularly known as horse flies, is an important vector group. This is the first study to ascertain the abundance and diversity of horse flies in horses at the cerrado biome of the state of Tocantins, Brazil. Collecting took place in typical Cerrado, and sampling occurred in the dry and rainy seasons. The horseflies were collected from horses using an entomological net. A total of 249 individuals were collected and spread over 25 species. The prevalent species were Stypommisa aripuana (25.8%) and Catachlorops rufescens (6.4%), in the dry period, and Fidena lissorhina (22.5%), Tabanus occidentalis var. dorsovittatus (10%) and Poeciloderas quadripunctatus (6.4%), in the rainy season. The results suggest that tabanids attack horses throughout the dry and rainy seasons, posing a constant threat to their health in the Cerrado of Tocantins. © 2024, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

ABSTRACT: We present sequential oxygen isotope records (δ18Ophosphate vs. VSMOW) of horse tooth enamel phosphate of six individuals from two adjacent Palaeolithic sites in Lower Austria. Three molars from the site Krems-Wachtberg date to 33–31k cal a bp, and three molars from Kammern-Grubgraben to 24–20k cal a bp. All teeth show seasonal isotope variations, which are used to reconstruct the annual oxygen isotope composition of drinking water (δ18Odw) and palaeotemperatures. Measured δ18Ophosphate values ranged from 8.6 to 13.0‰ and from 10.8 to 13.9‰ at Krems-Wachtberg and Kammern-Grubgraben, respectively. An inverse modelling approach was used to reconstruct summer and winter temperatures after a correction for glacial oceanic source water δ18O. Reconstructed annual δ18Odw was −16.4 ± 1.5‰ at Krems-Wachtberg and −15.3 ± 1.4‰ at Kammern-Grubgraben, resulting in annual temperatures of −5.7 ± 3.1 and −3.5 ± 2.9°C, respectively. Summer and winter temperatures reconstructed from individual teeth exhibit high seasonal variations with moderate summer temperatures and extremely low winter temperatures typical for a polar tundra climate. Isotopic differences between individuals are attributed to interannual climate variability or to different drinking water sources. Our reconstructed temperatures are, overall, consistent with previously reported values from European horse teeth, when taking regional differences into account. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Knowing the behavioural responses of horses while planning the training processes is crucial in constituting the appropriate training program. The purpose of the study was to examine some behavioural and physiological responses of Arabian horses participating in flat races against the reactivity to human and fear tests. Within the scope of this study, 15 female Arabian horses aged between 2 and 8 years were subjected to reactivity to passive human test, reactivity to active human test, and handling tests from reactivity to human tests and the novel surface test, the static novel object test, and the startling novel object tests from fear tests. Significant relationships (P <.05) were detected between the agonistic behaviours of horses and maximum heart rate values in the passive human test, active human test, static novel object test, and startling novel object test. Active human test, it was determined that as the agonistic behaviours of horses increased, the distance to approach humans increased (P <.05). The novel surface test observed that as the horses' agonistic behaviours increased, the number of attempts to cross the surface successfully also increased (P <.01). In the handling test, increased agonistic behaviours caused the test time to prolong (P <.01). As a result, it was determined that various processes in training were prolonged in horses with high agonistic behaviours during the tests. It has also been determined that the trainability of horses may differ within the same breed and sex. For this reason, it is recommended to determine behavioural responses and to plan horse training individually. By understanding the trainability of horses, it is possible to achieve maximum efficiency for their benefit. © 2024, Ataturk Universitesi. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of a single dose of the NSAIDs phenylbutazone, firocoxib, flunixin meglumine, and ketoprofen on concentrations of growth factors and cytokines in autologous protein solution (APS) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). ANIMALS 6 adult university-owned horses. METHODS For the first phase, 6 horses were randomized to receive ketoprofen (1,000 mg) or flunixin meglumine (500 mg) IV. Blood was obtained and processed for APS (Pro-Stride) and PRP (Restigen) before and 6 hours after administration of NSAIDs. Horses underwent a 2-week washout period, after which the protocol was repeated using a crossover design. For the second phase, following at least a 2-week washout period, the study protocol was repeated with phenylbutazone (1 g) or firocoxib (57 mg) administered orally. Plasma was collected 6 hours after administration for evaluation of drug concentrations, and APS and PRP were analyzed for concentrations of drug, platelets, leukocytes, and several growth factors and cytokines (PDGF, fibroblast growth factor, TGF-β1, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α) before and 6 hours after administration of NSAIDs using immunoassays. RESULTS There were no significant differences in concentrations of cytokines or growth factors before or after administration of any NSAID. There were significant differences in concentrations of leukocytes and platelets based on both product and time. NSAID concentrations in plasma were not significantly different from concentrations in APS and PRP. CLINICAL RELEVANCE These results help guide clinicians on the appropriate use of these NSAIDs in conjunction with the processing of APS and PRP, which is unlikely to significantly alter the final product after single-dose administration. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, confocal microscopic, histologic, and virologic features of horses with macrodendritic ulcerative keratitis and conjunctival lymphoid hyperplasia associated with equine herpesvirus-2 and equine herpesvirus-5 infection. Animal Studied: Four foals with bilateral ocular disease. Procedures: Complete ophthalmic examination was performed for each horse, and corneal samples were collected for cytology and microbiologic evaluation, including virus isolation and molecular diagnostics for the equine herpesviruses. In vivo confocal microscopy examination of the cornea was performed in two horses. Conjunctival biopsies for histopathology were collected from two horses with nodular conjunctival thickening. Results: Each horse had bilateral, large, superficial dendritic corneal ulcerations that covered extensive regions of the corneal surface. Corneal in vivo confocal microscopy examination in two horses detected inflammatory cells and populations of morphologically abnormal corneal epithelial cells adjacent to the ulcerations. The abnormal epithelial cells included round, relatively small, hyperreflective cells intermixed with elongated, enlarged, hyperreflective cells. Equine herpesvirus-2 was isolated from corneal samples of 2 horses and detected by PCR assay in the other two horses. Equine herpesvirus-5 was also detected by PCR assay in three of the horses. Conjunctival histopathology identified predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates. The macrodendrites and conjunctival masses resolved with topical antiviral therapy (cidofovir or idoxuridine) in all horses and did not recur. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: The equine gammaherpesviruses may be associated with the development of macrodendritic ulcerative keratitis and conjunctival lymphocytic masses in foals. In vivo confocal microscopy of horses with macrodendrites revealed similar findings to other host species with herpetic dendritic keratitis. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Animal welfare is a result of accumulated negative and positive emotions. Therefore, it is important to limit the former and promote the latter. Doing so requires a precise identification of these emotions. The aim of this study was to characterize the behaviours, facial expressions and locomotor parameters of 21 horses in two conditions with opposite valence, presumed to induce positive anticipation and frustration. In the positive anticipation situation, the horse was led to a bucket of food, knowing that they would be allowed to eat it. In the frustration situation, experimenters indicated to the horse that food was available without allowing them to eat it. In the positive anticipation situation, horses exhibited a lower neck position with the ears forward and upper lip advanced and went faster by increasing their stride frequency accompanied by increased global locomotor activity. In the frustration situation, horses exhibited a higher neck position with the ears backward or to the side, accompanied by ear movements and eye blinks, and interacted more with the experimenters. This study describes new possible indicators of positive anticipations and frustration in horses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma is an intracellular parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis in humans and animals. In this disease, parasitic cysts of Toxoplasma gondii can remain present in various tissues such as the brain throughout the host's life. The potential role of toxoplasmosis should be considered in many neurological diseases with unknown mechanisms. In horses, behavioral disorders like crib-biting have multifactorial causes and may be due to neurophysiological dysfunction. This research aimed to determine the role of toxoplasmosis in the manifestation of crib-biting behavior in horses. A case-control study was conducted in horse riding clubs in Fars province, Iran, near the city of Shiraz. Ten horses with crib-biting behavior and 10 clinically healthy horses matched for sex, age, and breed were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were collected from cribbers and healthy horses, along with a thorough history-taking. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed on sera to detect T. gondii-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). The results of this study revealed that all horses were free of toxoplasmosis. It is concluded that this relation was not detected in the horse farms of Shiraz suburbs. Further research is required to explore more aspects of crib-biting behavior and its relationship with causative factors. © 2024, Published by the University of Tabriz.

ABSTRACT: The domestic horse (Equus ferus caballus) makes dung deposits to form “stud-piles” and compulsively examines dung droppings, suggesting that dung contains species-relevant information. The present study investigates horses’ use of location (place), odor (object) and memory for dung sniff encounters. Horses were video recorded in 2 indoor and 4 outdoor riding arenas as they were taken at different time intervals to experimenter-determined objects or dung deposits that they could sniff. Frame-by-frame video analysis measured approaches, sniff duration, nostril use, ear position and blinking associated with dung investigation. Horses approached and sniffed dung-deposits for longer duration than non-dung objects in all test locations. They made head movements across the extent of dung-deposits when sniffing, showed no nostril or ear preference directed to the target, and blinked as they disengage from sniffing. Reduced approach probability and sniff duration showed that they displayed good place/object memory for dung previously visited at similar and different locations on the same day but poor memory for dung visited on a previous day. Adaptive forgetting of object/place memory for dung after a previous day's dung visit may optimizes risk assessment, including the possibility of premature interruption of foraging by conspecifics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cataracts resulting from equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) or other forms of uveitis are usually associated with rapid progression. ERU is the most common ocular disease cause of blindness and cause of cataracts in horses. The necessity for the posterior capsulorhexis (PC) during phacoemulsification (PE) is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate vision and complications after PE combined with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in horses with uveitis-associated cataracts and compare the PE technique with and without posterior capsulorhexis. Methods: Thirty-two eyes of 28 horses with uveitis-associated cataracts aged 14 months to 19.6 years were treated with PE-PPV under identical conditions. Twenty-three eyes of 21 horses were affected by an ERU-associated (ERU group), and nine eyes of 7 horses were affected by cataracts related to uveitis with pathogenesis different to ERU (non-ERU group). PE-PPV was performed in 12 eyes of 10 horses (PC group) and 20 eyes of 18 horses without posterior capsulorhexis (NPC group). Follow-up examination was performed at a mean of 1.7 ± 1.8 years postoperatively (range: 1 month–6.4 years). Results: In the period up to 1 month postoperatively, 17/20 (85%) NPC-eyes and 8/12 (67%) PC-eyes (total: 25/32 [78%]) were visual. From 1–6 months postoperatively, 16/20 (80%) NPC-eyes and 7/12 (58.3%) PC-eyes (total: 23/32 [72%]), and from 6–12 months, 7/11 (63.6%) NPC-eyes and 3/8 (37.5%) PC-eyes (total: 10/19 [52.6%]) were visual. From 12–18 months postoperatively, 3/7 (42.9%) NPC-eyes and 2/9 (22.2%) PC-eyes (total: 5/16 [31.3%]), and from 18–24 months, 3/8 (37.5%) NPC-eyes and 1/8 (12.5%) PC-eyes (total: 4/16 [25%]) were visual. After 24 months postoperatively, 2/7 (28.6%) NPC-eyes and 1/8 (12.5%) PC-eyes (total: 3/15 [20%]) were visual. Despite the higher number of visual eyes in the NPC group at each time point, differences were not significant. No obvious differences regarding postsurgical vision were observed between the ERU- and non-ERU groups at each time point. In the overall population, a significant decrease in the number of eyes with postoperative active uveitis was observed during the follow-up examinations (p < 0.001). A significant increase in the number of eyes that were blind due to retinal detachment was observed in the overall patient population as the examination period progressed (p < 0.001). Retinal detachment was the sole long-term cause of blindness. Conclusions: In horses diagnosed with uveitis-associated cataracts and treated with PE-PPV, no persistent active uveitis was observed in the present study during follow-up examinations. However, the proportion of eyes that were blind due to retinal detachment increased. Whilst PE-PPV may prevent postsurgical persistent active uveitis and remove lens opacity, the prognosis for a visual outcome is guarded. A superior outcome in postsurgical vision was observed in the NPC group. However, caution is required when interpreting these results due to several factors that affect the independent comparison of the surgical groups. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Hay nets are a commonly used management practice to increase intake time and reduce hay waste but may impact horse health. The objectives were to compare hay usage, dental wear, and dental conditions between horses fed with (NET) or without (CON) hay nets during a 2-year cross-over study. In September 2021, 13 mature adult horses were blocked by bodyweight (BW) and randomly assigned to the NET or CON treatments for one year. After one year (September 2022), horses switched treatments and the trial concluded in September 2023. Horses were housed in adjacent dry lots with shelter, ad libitum water, and free choice access to round bales with or without hay nets (4.45 cm openings). Blinded dental work, including incisor length measurements and recording of dental abnormalities and conditions, and recording of horse BW and body condition score (BCS) were completed in September 2021, 2022, and 2023. Digital images were taken monthly to determine rostral oral cavity scores (ROCS). Round bales were weighed prior to being placed in the dry lot and the date fed was recorded to calculate hay usage. Significance was set at P≤0.05. Horse BW, BCS, and hay usage were greater in horses consuming hay without hay nets (P<0.05). No differences were observed in incisor length, presence of incisor bevels, ROCS, or dental abnormalities and conditions (P>0.05). These data suggest that hay nets do not result in negative impacts on dental health but can reduce hay usage and help to control horse BW and BCS. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The natural behaviour of horses is to spend the majority of their time on feed intake The feeding of stabled horses is, however, often far from that, as their feed intake is limited to their nutritional requirements. In order to approach their natural foraging time, it is important to extend the feed intake time of stabled horses. The aim of this study was to estimate if the feed intake time differs when feeding haylage in a haynet, hayball, metal corner manger, or from the box floor. The experimental design consisted of a Latin square, occurred across four days with four adult Icelandic horses and four treatments. Horses were stabled in individual boxes and fed 7 kg of high-energy haylage in two even meals while the intake time was recorded. The feed intake time per kg DM was shorter from the manger or the box floor than from a haynet or hayball (81 or 85 min versus 94 or 96 min; p < 0.05). It can be concluded that feeding haylage in a hayball or in a haynet can increase the feed intake time by 13% per day (12 min/kg DM/day) when compared to the more traditional methods. Thus, with simple alternatives, it is possible to extend the feed intake time of stabled horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: With a history tracing back to at least the 18th century and a substantial global influence on various breeds, Polish Arabian horse population is of paramount importance for both breeders and conservationists. However, its genetic makeup and the population dynamics are still not well understood. This study presents an analysis of the modern Polish Arabian horse population using pedigree data, focusing on the breed's genetic diversity and population structure. Our analysis encompassed 1 498 individuals defined as the reference population (RP) and their 11 065 ancestors, which resulted in the dataset of 12 254 individuals (total population). We traced their genealogy to assess inbreeding coefficients (F), founder effects, and genetic variability measures such as the effective number of founders (fe), ancestors (fa), or founder genome equivalents (fge). The results indicated a good pedigree quality with an average of 28.1 maximum traced generations, revealing high pedigree completeness for initial generations with a decline beyond the seventh generation. The genetic diversity parameters showed a considerable bottleneck effect, with an effective number of founders at 73, which reflects a substantial loss of genetic diversity over time. Despite the vast total number of founders (852), only a few have had a lasting impact on the current population, signaling the need for revised breeding strategies to maintain diversity. The study identified a slight but consistent rise in inbreeding over the last century, with a marginal recent decline, and a significant difference in the contribution of various founders. The average F was 5.8%, with 99.6% of the reference population being inbred. The analysis of effective population size (Ne) highlighted potential risks for genetic diversity, urging for revision of breeding goals to consider a wider array of founder lineages. The study indicated that stallions belonging to RP can be attributed to 15 distinct sirelines, whereas mares to 45 unique damlines, more than considered in the current breeding program (8 and 15, respectively). Conclusively, the study underlines the need for ongoing monitoring and strategic breeding to maintain and enhance the genetic diversity of Polish Arabians, considering the breed's historical significance and contemporary genetic challenges. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Prognostic indicators for equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF), an interstitial fibrosing lung disease, are poorly described. Hypothesis/Objectives: Describe diagnostic findings and outcome predictors for EMPF. Animals: Forty-six adult horses with EMPF. Methods: Retrospective multicenter case series from 2009 to 2019. Radiographic (n = 27) and ultrasonographic studies (n = 19) from EMPF horses and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology from 6 EMPF and 13 asthma cases were independently reviewed and blinded to diagnosis and outcome. Associations between predictor variables and survival were assessed by predictor screening followed by Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: Primary clinical findings were weight loss (36/46, 78%), increased respiratory effort (33/46, 72%), tachypnea (32/46, 70%), and fever (18/46, 39%). Macrophage atypia was seen in more EMPF than asthmatic horse BALF (67% vs. 8%; P =.02). Equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) was detected in 24 of 30 (80%) and hyperfibrinogenemia in 25 of 28 (89%) cases. Twenty-seven of 46 horses (59%) and 11 of 45 (24%) survived to discharge and to 3 months, respectively. Three-month survival was associated with lower median (range) respiratory rates (30 [24-36] vs. 41 [30-60] breaths per minute; P =.04), and higher BALF lymphocyte:neutrophil ratios (4.7 [1.4-22] vs. 0.47 [0.11-1.9]; P =.01) and blood lymphocyte counts (1.25 [0.93-2.55] vs. 0.90 [0.70-1.24] × 109/L; P =.03). Imaging findings, EHV-5 detection, and corticosteroid treatment were not associated with survival. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Fever is not a sensitive clinical sign of EMPF. Diagnostic testing should be pursued for horses with increased respiratory rate and effort and weight loss. The prognosis for EMPF horses is poor. Corticosteroid treatment does not improve 3-month survival. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) infection is associated with upper respiratory disease, EHM, abortions, and neonatal death. Research Questions: Are nasal secretions a more sensitive biological sample compared to blood for the detection of EHV-1 infection? How long is EHV-1 detectable after primary infection by PCR?. Methods: MedLine and Web of Science searches identified original peer-reviewed reports evaluating nasal shedding and viremia using virus isolation methods or PCR published in English before October 9, 2023. Results: Sixty experimental and 20 observational studies met inclusion criteria. EHV-1 detection frequency by qPCR in nasal secretions and blood from naturally-infected horses with fever and respiratory signs were 15% and 9%, respectively; qPCR detection rates in nasal secretions and blood from horses with suspected EHM were 94% and 70%, respectively. In experimental studies the sensitivity of qPCR matched or exceeded that seen for virus isolation from either nasal secretions or blood. Detection of nasal shedding typically occurred within 2 days after EHV-1 inoculation with a detection period of 3 to 7 days. Viremia lasted 2 to 7 days and was usually detected ≥1 days after positive identification of EHV-1 in nasal secretions. Nasal shedding and viremia decreased over time and remained detectable in some horses for several weeks after inoculation. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Under experimental conditions, blood and nasal secretions have similar sensitivity for the detection of EHV-1 when horses are sampled on multiple consecutive days. In contrast, in observational studies detection of EHV-1 in nasal secretions was consistently more successful. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV-1) infection in horses is associated with respiratory and neurologic disease, abortion, and neonatal death. Hypothesis: Vaccines decrease the occurrence of clinical disease in EHV-1-infected horses. Methods: A systematic review was performed searching multiple databases to identify relevant studies. Selection criteria were original peer-reviewed research reports that investigated the in vivo use of vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by EHV-1 in domesticated horses. Main outcomes of interest included pyrexia, abortion, neurologic disease, viremia, and nasal shedding. We evaluated risk of bias, conducted exploratory meta-analyses of incidence data for the main outcomes, and performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for each vaccine subtype. Results: A total of 1018 unique studies were identified, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria. Experimental studies accounted for 31/35 studies, with the remainder being observational studies. Eight vaccine subclasses were identified including commercial (modified-live, inactivated, mixed) and experimental (modified-live, inactivated, deletion mutant, DNA, recombinant). Risk of bias was generally moderate, often because of underreporting of research methods, and sample sizes were small leading to imprecision in the estimate of the effect size. Several studies reported either no benefit or minimal vaccine efficacy for the primary outcomes of interest. Meta-analyses revealed significant heterogeneity was present, and our confidence in the quality of evidence for most outcomes was low to moderate. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Our review indicates that commercial and experimental vaccines minimally reduce the incidence of clinical disease associated with EHV-1 infection. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To highlight the use of procainamide as a potential alternative treatment modality in cases of ventricular tachycardia that are refractory to lidocaine and magnesium sulfate. ANIMAL 1 adult horse weighing 380 kg. CLINICAL PRESENTATION, PROGRESSION, AND PROCEDURES A 25-year-old Arabian gelding presented with severe colic signs. Due to persistent pain, it was elected to carry out an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure a diagnosis of severe, unstable ventricular tachycardia was made based on the ECG findings, with an initial heart rate of 195 beats per minute and severe hypotension. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Initial treatment consisted of discontinuing dobutamine and the administration of a 2 mg/kg IV lidocaine bolus followed by a continuous rate infusion at 50 mg/kg/min. Twenty grams magnesium sulfate (5 mg/kg) was administered IV in 1 L of lactated Ringer solution as a slow bolus over 30 minutes. Ventricular tachycardia persisted with poor peripheral pulses, a severely dampened arterial waveform, and a MAP of 30 to 45 mm Hg. Two milligrams/kg IV procainamide was administered over 3 minutes, 3 separate times, at 5-minute intervals. Immediately following the third dose sinus rhythm was detected on the ECG, the arterial waveform improved, and MAP increased to 85 mm Hg. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Ventricular tachycardia is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication in horses undergoing general anesthesia. The potential of this arrhythmia to progress to ventricular fibrillation is of grave concern, as the option to attempt to externally defibrillate horses back to normal sinus rhythm does not exist. This case highlights procainamide as a potential option for cases of ventricular tachycardia that are refractory to more standard treatment modalities. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: A 1-year-old Belgian Warmblood with a previously known history of successfully repaired temporal and parietal bone fractures sustained at 14 days of age was presented for investigation of a recent, acute and progressive quadrilateral ataxia. The owner reported a lack of coordination and difficulty getting up, with progressing paresis 2 weeks prior to the presentation. Neurological examination revealed pronounced hypermetria/dysmetria in the walk and trot in all four limbs. No evidence of cranial nerve deficits was observed. The horse was in good general condition with unremarkable clinical parameters. Survey lateral radiographs of the cervical spine revealed significant signs of cervical vertebral malformation, including hypertrophy of the articular process joints, indicating narrowing of the spinal canal with suspected cervical stenotic myelopathy. Cervical computed tomographic (CT) myelography revealed the presence of multiple dorsal subarachnoid diverticula causing significant spinal cord compression at multiple locations, with osteoarthrosis of the cervical articular process joints. Due to a poor prognosis and guarded surgical outcome, the owner declined further treatment, and the horse was discharged with conservative corticosteroid treatment. The patient was euthanised shortly after the initial presentation due to progressive worsening signs. To the authors' knowledge, CT myelography findings in a yearling with cervical subarachnoid multiple diverticula have not been previously published. This case illustrates the usefulness of advanced imaging techniques, such as CT myelography, in combination with static and dynamic radiography to provide a better and more accurate diagnosis. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Induced mutagenesis was employed in horse gram cv. CRIDA 1-18R with an objective of evolving mutants with increased yield potential. Methods: Based on preliminary study, the variety has been irradiated with desirable doses of gamma rays (200 Gy and 300 Gy), electron beam (100 Gy and 200 Gy) and its combination (100 Gy) and the material were forwarded to M2 generation following parent-progeny row basis. The genotypes exhibiting superior yield than control were further forwarded to M3 generation. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine the induction of micro-mutants for 11 quantitative traits. Result: The reduction in mean value over control was observed for most of the yield component traits at M2 generation. Among the mutagenic treatments, combination of gamma rays with electron beam registered high mean values for pod length (5.05 cm), number of pods per plant (54.42) and single plant yield (25.68 g) at M3 generation. Non-significant skewness and / or kurtosis at M3 population denoted the absence of epistatic interactions for plant yield. An increase in variability pattern, H2 and GAM at M3 generation indicated the scope for trait (plant height, number of seeds per pod, number of clusters per plant, number of pods per plant, biological yield and single plant yield) improvement through selection. © 2024, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) has severe impact on the sport horse population. Objective: Study the influence of EHM on the likelihood of affected horses to return to their previous performance and investigate the association of clinical variables with prognosis. Animals: Twenty-six horses positive for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) were admitted to a veterinary teaching hospital (VTH) during a natural EHM outbreak at an international jumping event. Methods: Data collected from the VTH, the International Equestrian Federation, and surveys completed by the riders and horse owners were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Horses affected by EHM had 68% chance of returning to exercise, and 52.9% were able to achieve their preoutbreak performance level. Horses with an ataxia grade at admission ≥4/5 had an increased fatality rate (P <.05) and 10% chance of reaching their preoutbreak performance level. None of the horses with both vascular and urinary complications returned to their previous performance level. Finally, horses vaccinated against EHV-1 and those with urinary complications had a 71.4% and 43.7% fatality rate, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Horses affected by EHM were able to return to their previous performance levels, but certain clinical variables were negatively associated with postoutbreak performance. Ataxia grade upon admission and the development of systemic signs of vasculitis and urinary complications were potential poor prognostic indicators in sport horses. Variables linked to fatality included prior vaccination against EHV-1, ataxia grade upon admission, and the development of urinary complications. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Salt (NaCl) is an essential nutrient for horses because their diet is low in sodium and they lose salt in sweat. Given the many types of salt block available, 342 horse owners were surveyed to see what type they offered their horses. The owners most often offered plain(30%) mineralized (29%) or Himalayan salt blocks. Next, adult mares were given two choice preference tests between plain (white) and mineralized (red) salt blocks, between mineralized and selenium (green) blocks, between plain and selenium, between Himalayan (pink) and plain and between Himalayan and selenium salt blocks. The horses preferred plain salt to Himalayan salt, but showed no preference between the other combinations. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background and objective: Lameness assessment in the gaited Icelandic horse is complex. We aimed to describe their kinematic and temporal adaptation strategies in response to forelimb lameness at walk, trot and tölt. Study design: In vivo experiment. Methods: Ten clinically non-lame Icelandic horses were measured before and after reversible forelimb lameness induction. Upper body and limb kinematics were measured using 11 inertial measurement units mounted on the poll, withers, pelvis (tubera sacrale) and all four limbs and hoofs (Equimoves®, 500 Hz). Horses were measured on a straight line at walk and trot in-hand and at walk, trot and tölt while ridden. Linear mixed models were used to compare baseline and lame conditions (random factor = ‘horse’), and results are presented as the difference in estimated marginal means or percentage of change. Results: Lameness induction significantly (p < 0.05) increased head vertical movement asymmetry at walk (HDmin/HDmaxHAND: 18.8/5.7 mm, HDmin/HDmaxRIDDEN: 9.8/0.3 mm) and trot (HDmin/HDmaxHAND: 18.1/7.8 mm, HDmin/HDmaxRIDDEN: 24.0/9.3 mm). At the tölt, however, HDmin did not change significantly (1.1 mm), but HDmax increased by 11.2 mm (p < 0.05). Furthermore, pelvis vertical movement asymmetry (PDmax) increased by 4.9 mm, sound side dissociation decreased (−8.3%), and sound diagonal dissociation increased (6.5%). Other temporal stride variables were also affected, such as increased stance duration of both forelimbs at walk, tölt and in-hand trot. Main limitations: Only one degree of lameness (mild) was induced with an acute lameness model. Conclusions: Classical forelimb lameness metrics, such as vertical head and withers movement asymmetry, were less valuable at tölt compared to walk and trot, except for HDmax. Therefore, it is advised to primarily use the walk and trot to detect and quantify forelimb lameness in the Icelandic horse. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP) manages a herd of feral horses (Equus caballus) which was present on the landscape prior to the establishment of the park. The population presents a unique scenario in that it has experienced fairly intensive and well-documented management since the park's establishment, including herd size reductions, intentional introduction of diversity, and subsequent attempts to remove introduced lineages. This provides an interesting case study on the genetic effects of diverse evolutionary forces on an isolated feral population. To explore the effects of these forces and clarify the relationship of this feral herd with other horses, we used genome-wide markers to examine the population structure of a combined dataset containing common established breeds. Using the Illumina Equine 70k BeadChip, we sampled SNPs across the genome for 118 TRNP horses and evaluated the inbreeding coefficient f and runs of homozygosity (RoH). To identify breed relationships, we compared 23 representative TRNP samples with 792 horses from 35 different breeds using genomic population structure analyses. Mean f of TRNP horses was 0.180, while the mean f for all other breeds in the dataset was 0.116 (SD 0.079). RoH analysis indicates that the TRNP population has experienced recent inbreeding in a timeframe consistent with their management. With Bayesian clustering, PCA, and maximum likelihood phylogeny, TRNP horses show genetic differentiation from other breeds, likely due to isolation, historical population bottlenecks, and genetic drift. However, maximum likelihood phylogeny places them with moderate confidence (76.8%) among draft breeds, which is consistent with the known history of breeds used on early North Dakota ranches and stallions subsequently introduced to the park herd. These findings will help resolve speculation about the origins of the herd and inform management decisions for the TRNP herd. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In racehorses, the risk of musculoskeletal injury is linked to a decrease in speed and stride length (SL) over consecutive races prior to injury. Surface characteristics influence stride parameters. We hypothesized that large changes in stride parameters are found during galloping in response to dirt racetrack preparation. Harrowing of the back stretch of a half-mile dirt racetrack was altered in three individual lanes with decreasing depth from the inside to the outside. Track underlay compaction and water content were changed between days. Twelve horses (six on day 2) were sequentially galloped at a target speed of 16 ms−1 across the three lanes. Speed, stride frequency (SF), and SL were quantified with a GPS/GNSS logger. Mixed linear models with speed as covariate analyzed SF and SL, with track hardness and moisture content as fixed factors (p < 0.05). At the average speed of 16.48 ms−1, hardness (both p < 0.001) and moisture content (both p < 0.001) had significant effects on SF and SL. The largest difference in SL of 0.186 m between hardness and moisture conditions exceeded the 0.10 m longitudinal decrease over consecutive race starts previously identified as injury predictor. This suggests that detailed measurements of track conditions might be useful for refining injury prediction models. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a tincture from the dried fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (omicha tincture), when used as a sensory additive in feed for horses, cats, dogs, and in feed and in water for drinking for poultry. The product is a water/ethanol (55:45 v/v) solution, with a dry matter content of not more than 4% (w/w) and a content of 0.01%–0.15% (w/w) for the sum of schisandrin and deoxyschisandrin. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) concluded that omicha tincture is safe at the following concentrations in complete feed: 16 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 12 mg/kg for chickens for fattening and other poultry for fattening or reared for laying/reproduction, 18 mg/kg for laying hens and other laying/reproductive birds, 56 mg/kg for dogs and 47 mg/kg for horses and cats. The additive is considered safe for consumers when used up to the highest safe level in feed for poultry species and horses. Omicha tincture should be considered as irritants to skin and eyes, and as dermal and respiratory sensitisers. The use of omicha tincture as a flavour in feed for poultry species and horses was not considered to be a risk to the environment. Since it was recognised that the fruit of S. chinensis can influence sensory properties of feedingstuffs, no further demonstration of efficacy was considered necessary for the tincture under assessment. © 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

ABSTRACT: A 1.5-year-old American quarter horse gelding (case 1) and an 11-month-old American quarter horse filly (case 2) were presented for acute onset pelvic lameness and lethargy. Case 1 had nasal discharge, while case 2 developed rapid muscle atrophy. Both horses had elevated serum creatine kinase activity. The horses showed similar polyphasic histiocytic and lymphoplasmacytic myositis with necrosis, mineralization, and regeneration. Additionally, case 1 had Streptococcus equi subsp. equi-induced suppurative retropharyngeal lymphadenitis with renal purpura hemorrhagica and myoglobinuric nephropathy. A focal pulmonary abscess caused by Actinobacillus equuli was found in case 2. Genetic testing revealed case 1 as heterozygous and case 2 as homozygous for the E321G MYH1 variant, supporting the diagnosis of myosin heavy-chain myopathy, with concomitant bacterial disease as potential triggers. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis are two of the most common parasitic zoonoses. Leishmaniasis is endemic to 98 countries around the world, whereas toxoplasmosis is widely distributed throughout the world, causing significant health expenditure. Horses can play a relevant role in the transmission of the disease, being a silent reservoir, as clinical signs are not common. Serum samples from 166 horses living in eastern Spain (Mediterranean basin) were analysed to determine the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. and T. gondii by ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay.) The risk factors evaluated were the geographical area and the relative humidity and average temperature, and epidemiological factors such as sex, reproductive status, age, breed, morphotype, living with other domestic animals, use and access to the outdoors. Seroprevalence of Leishmania spp. and T. gondii infection was found 28.92%, and 16.27% respectively, whereas co-infection of the two parasites was found only in two males. Leishmania seroprevalence was high in castrated males and several mesodolichomorphic equine breeds used for teaching, as well as in outdoor animals. The most elevated seroprevalence was found in winter with higher levels of rainfall, whereas high seroprevalence of T. gondii was found in crossbreeding animals and those used for breeding. High seroprevalence of Leishmania spp. and T. gondii was found in horses of the Mediterranean basin. These data suggest that horses can act as a silent reservoir and that this species has high potential for transmission to humans, outdoor animals and in geographical areas with high average rainfall. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Evaporation is a basic element in the hydrological cycle that plays a vital role in a region’s water balance. In this paper, the Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) algorithm was used to optimize long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector regression (SVR) to estimate daily pan evaporation (Ep). Primary meteorological variables including minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), sunshine hours (SSH), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (WS) were collected from two synoptic meteorological stations with different climates which are situated in Fars province, Iran. One of the stations is located in Larestan city with a hot desert climate and the other is in Abadeh city with a cold dry climate. The partial mutual information (PMI) algorithm was utilized to identify the efficient input variables (EIVs) on Ep. The results of the PMI algorithm proved that the Tmax, Tmin, and RH for Larestan station and also the Tmax, Tmin, and SSH for Abadeh station are the EIVs on Ep. The results showed the LSTM–WHO hybrid model for both stations can ameliorate the daily Ep estimation and it can also reduce the estimation error. Therefore, the LSTM–WHO hybrid model was proposed as a powerful model compared to standalone models in estimating daily Ep © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to investigate Babesia caballi in horses at three main gatherings of racehorses located in the Baghdad Governorate through clinical examinations, microscopy, and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The 18S rRNA gene of B. caballi was PCR amplified, sequenced, and phylogenetically examined between January and December of 2021. One hundred sixty blood samples were taken from horses of different ages, breeds, and sexes. Prevalence and risk variables for babesiosis were analyzed using chi-square tests and odds ratios. 3 ml of blood was taken from the jugular vein in test tubes containing anticoagulant to detect Babesia caballi in blood smears and molecular technology. The outcomes showed that the clinical manifestations of babesiosis comprised pale to icterus, mucus membranes, emaciation, anorexia, and leg swelling, a slight increase in body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Microscopic observation revealed the presence of Babesia caballi in 49 out of 160 (30.625%) horse blood smears. These smears exhibited various morphological stages of B. caballi within the red blood cells. The confirmation process of 160 blood samples by PCR to detect 18Sr RNA demonstrated that 91 samples (56.87%) yielded positive findings for the desired product size of 540 base pairs (bp). There was no significant variation in the percentage of infection with B. caballi between stallions and mares. Additionally, it is worth noting that no age group exhibited a significant prevalence of infection. However, it is essential to highlight that Arabian horse breeds showed a greater susceptibility to infection at a rate of 63.34%; however, this difference was not statistically significant when compared to Thoroughbred and crossbred horses. This study identified a new genotype of Babesia caballi based on phylogenetic analysis of our samples and comparison with data from the International Gene Bank. This genotype, called Clade C, is characterized by a high infection rate and low illness severity. © Authors, 2024, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Mosul.

ABSTRACT: Physical activity, especially high-intensity training (HIT), leads to physiological and behavioural changes. The objectives of this randomized cross-over study were to investigate i) the effects of physical exercise on weight, behaviours, and head and ear positions on the days after low-intensity training (LIT) or high-intensity training; and ii) to explore if behaviours, and/or physiological parameters (sweat, salivation and blood lactate levels) during training can predict post-training behaviours. A total of nineteen French trotter horses housed in four different training centres were studied the day before (Dpre) and after LIT or HIT (afternoon after training (Dtraining) and 2 days after training (D1Post and D2Post)). The results showed that horses exhibited i) longer durations of resting and head below the withers (HBW) on Dtraining and D1Post than on Dpre and ii) shorter eating durations on D1Post and D2Post than on Dpre after HIT. This was associated with significant weight loss on D2Post. Several behaviours associated with discomfort (e.g., head conflict behaviours, nose behind the vertical, and open mouth), as well as amount of sweat, seemed to predict the durations of resting, HBW and eating on D1Post. Thus, behaviours are impacted by training, and a combination of behaviours and visible physiological parameters exhibited during training have the potential to predict physical tiredness in harness racing horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Neutrophilic inflammation is associated with the degree of airway obstruction in severe equine asthma (SEA), but the contribution of these leukocytes to bronchial remodeling remains ill defined. Neutrophils could cause structural alterations of the airways by the release of exosomes, a type of cell-derived nanoparticles that can modify the biology of local and distant cells. Neutrophil-derived exosomes have been shown to increase airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell proliferation in humans and horses. Therefore, this study aimed to identify neutrophil exosomal microRNAs (miRs) implicated in the regulation of ASM biology in SEA. ANIMALS 6 horses with SEA and 6 healthy controls. METHODS The expression of selected miRs in exosomes from peripheral neutrophils was studied by quantitative PCR. The effects of miR-21 transfection in ASM cells were evaluated by gene expression analysis and proliferation studies. RESULTS The miR-21 was downregulated in neutrophil exosomes from SEA horses, and it attenuated the proliferation of ASM cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The lower level of miR-21 in neutrophil-derived exosomes could contribute to ASM hyperproliferation, which could, in turn, promote the thickening of the bronchial wall in SEA. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: Recent studies have shown that in Arabian horse muscle, long-term exercise-induced expression of genes related to fatty acid degradation and the downregulation of genes belonging to the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and insulin signalling pathways. Long-lasting physical exertion may trigger the metabolism to switch the main energy source from carbohydrates to lipids due to higher caloric content. Objectives: To describe the metabolism adaptation at the whole transcriptome of blood to endurance effort in Arabian horses. Study design: In vivo experiment. Methods: Venous blood samples from 10 Arabian horses were taken before and after a 120 km long endurance ride to isolate the RNA and perform the high-throughput NGS transcriptome sequencing. Results: The results, including KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) analyses, allowed us to describe the most significantly upregulated—ARV1, DGAT2, LIPE, APOA2, MOGAT1, MOGAT2, GYS1, GYS2 and downregulated—ACACA, ACACB, FADS1, FADS2 genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Also, the increased expression of RAF1, KRAS and NRAS genes involved in the Insulin pathway and PI3K–Akt was shown. Main limitations: Limited sample size, Arabians used for endurance racing were not compared to Arabians from other equestrian disciplines. Conclusions: This general insight into the processes described supports the thesis of the lipid-carbohydrates metabolism switch in endurance Arabian horses and provides the basis for further research. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: In horses with trigeminal-mediated headshaking (TMHS), clinical signs are likely to be expression of neuropathic facial pain. Currently, subjective assessment of disease severity is used as measure of compromise of animal's welfare. Objectives: To develop and validate a precise scoring system for TMHS: History, Rest and Exercise Score (HRE-S). The HRE-S consists of three subscores: history score (H-S), resting score (R-S) and exercise score (E-S). Study design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: Seven masked observers with different experience used HRE-S to score 40 video recordings taken during rest and lungeing including five duplicates. Video recordings were taken from nine horses with TMHS and three controls. Inter- and intraobserver reliability and practicability of HRE-S were assessed. For every video recording severity of clinical signs was graded by every observer using an intuitive global-type-scale and interobserver reliability was calculated. Convergent validity was evaluated comparing HRE-S to groups created by an existing score (grade 0–3). Discriminant validity was analysed comparing HRE-S to groups created by intuitive global-type-scale. Results: Reliability for HRE-S was excellent, irrespective of observers experience: Spearman's Rho = 0.946, p < 0.001 (intraobserver reliability) and intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.98, p < 0.001 (interobserver reliability). Interobserver reliability for intuitive global-type-scale was fair to substantial: Fleiss' κappa = 0.48 (R-S) −0.63 (E-S). Groups created by intuitive global-type-scale had significantly different R-S and E-S (p < 0.05), demonstrating discriminant validity. Convergent validity was proven as horses with grade 3/3 had significantly higher average E-S and total scores compared with an existing score than those with grade 0/3 or 1/3 (p < 0.001). Main limitations: Retrospective nature, video recordings, sample size. Conclusions: HRE-S is a valid and reliable score evaluating disease severity in TMHS, independent of observers' experience. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A seven-month pregnant 15-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented with acute abdominal pain to Jeju National University Equine Hospital. At presentation, a nasogastric intubation revealed 10 L of gastric reflux; rectal palpation and ultrasound revealed dilated loops and thickening of the walls of the small intestine. An exploratory laparotomy revealed strangulation of the small intestine due to a large abdominal mass. The mass was double-ligated and resected blindly due to the short pedicle. An enterectomy was not performed as intestinal motility was detected following the mass removal. Histopathological examination confirmed that the mass was a lipoma, measuring 24 cm × 16 cm × 16 cm in size. On day 8 post-surgery, the mare was discharged without complications. This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of strangulation of the small intestine by a pedunculated lipoma, thus providing useful information on lipoma in horses. © The Korean Society of Veterinary Clinics.

ABSTRACT: Kazakh mares have attracted widespread attention with their outstanding lactation traits. Lactation is a complex dynamic process regulated by multiple factors. The extensive application of transcriptome sequencing technology enables researchers to further explore this biological issue. This study selected three pregnant and three non-pregnant Kazakh mares as the research subject. Their mammary glands were taken for transcriptome sequencing. The results show that there are 9 lncRNAs and 122 mRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups. GO enrichment analysis shows that there are 175 molecular functions, 59 cellular components, and 555 biological processes, including cellular hormone metabolic process, hormone catabolic process, and I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling. KEGG enrichment analysis exhibits that these differential genes are mainly enriched in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, steroid hormone biosynthesis, breast cancer, ECM-receptor interaction, and MAPK signaling pathway. WNT4, DPP4, and NFKBIA are key nodes regulating breast activation. Conclusions: Through the comparative analysis of the transcriptome data of mammary tissues of pregnant and non-pregnant mares, relevant differentially expressed genes are screened and analyzed. This study provides valuable fundamental data for investigating candidate genes related to the lactation regulation and mammogenesis of Kazakh horses. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: The aim of this study was to examine variations in stress, metabolic, and physiological parameters of horses used in the traditional equestrian team sport of Kök-Börü in relation to winning and losing outcomes. Material and methods: To accomplish this, blood samples were taken from horses on four different teams who participated in two separate games, both before and after game. These samples were used to measure levels of cortisol, ACTH, beta-endorphin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) via species-specific commercial ELISA kits. The autoanalyzer tested biochemical and hematological parameters. The gathered data were then analyzed statistically based on the teams' winning or losing status. Results: The results suggested that winning teams had lower MID, red blood cell, HGB, RDW-SD, HCT, platelet distribution width, and creatine kinase values post-game in comparison to their pre-game state. Conversely, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and CREA values increased in the winning teams' post-game. Additionally, horses in the winning teams showed a decrease in cortisol, beta-endorphin, and ACTH levels post-game but increased levels of adrenaline and T3. Considering the pre-game values, it was found that GRA and Cl levels were lower in the winning teams. Before the game, adrenaline and T3 levels were higher in the winning teams. No significant difference was observed in post-game hematological parameters between the teams. However, post-game K, adrenaline, and noradrenaline levels were higher among the winning teams' horses, while cortisol and beta-endorphin levels were heightened in horses from the losing side. Conclusion: In conclusion, significant differences were not observed in the distribution of hematological and biochemical parameters of horses following the Kök-Börü games, regardless of the outcome. However, decreased post-game cortisol, ACTH, and beta-endorphin levels in winning teams may suggest better stress management abilities among these horses. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Salbutamol and hyoscine butylbromide (HBB) are commonly used bronchodilators in horses with severe asthma (SA). Objective: To compare the bronchodilation potency, duration, and adverse effects of salbutamol and HBB in SA. Animals: Six horses in exacerbation of SA. Methods: The effects of inhaled salbutamol (1000 μg) and HBB (150 mg, IV) were compared in a randomized, blinded, crossover experiment. Lung function, intestinal borborygmi and heart rate were assessed before and sequentially until 180 minutes after drug administration, and analyzed with 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. Results: Both treatments caused a similar improvement in lung function. Pulmonary resistance and reactance returned to baseline values within 30 minutes after HBB administration, whereas salbutamol improved reactance until 180 minutes (mean improvement at 180 minutes of 0.040 Kpa/L/s, 95% CI = 0.004 to 0.076; P =.02 for salbutamol and of 0.009 Kpa/L/s, 95% CI = −0.028 to 0.045; P =.98 for HBB for the resistance at 3 Hz and of 0.040 Kpa/L/s, 95% CI = 0.007 to 0.074; P =.01 for salbutamol and of 0.009 Kpa/L/s, 95% CI = −0.024 to 0.042; P =.97 for HBB for the reactance at 7 Hz). From 5 to 30 minutes after HBB administration, the heart rate accelerated (mean increase of 3.3 beats per minute, 95% CI = −6.6 to 13.1; P =.92 for salbutamol, and of 13.0 beats per minute, 95% CI = 3.6 to 22.4; P =.002 for HBB at 30 minutes) and the gut sounds decreased (mean reduction of 1.3, 95% CI = −0.1 to 2.8; P =.09 for salbutamol and of 2.8 for the gastrointestinal auscultation score, 95% CI = 1.4 to 4.3; P <.0001 for HBB at 30 minutes). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Both drugs have a similar bronchodilator potency but with a longer duration for salbutamol. Gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects were noted only with HBB, suggesting the preferential use of salbutamol to relieve bronchoconstriction in horses with asthma. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements obtained from first, second, and third probe-cornea touch (PCT) and compare them with the average of six PCTs using two rebound tonometers in horses. This study enrolled a total of thirty-eight stallions, comprising of 24 Arabian horses and 14 cross-breeds (with an average age of 8 ± 3 years). The IOP measurements of first, second, and third, as well as the average of six PCTs were obtained using either Tonovet (TV) or Tonovet Plus (TV+) rebound tonometers. The mean differences (95% limits of agreement) between the average of six PCTs and the first, second, and third PCTs were 0.1 (-4.8 to 5), 0.2 (-4.8 to 4.5), and 0.2 (-3.6 to 4.0) mmHg with TV, respectively. With TV+, the differences were 0.3 (-6.6 to 7.2), 1.1 (-8.6 to 10.8), and -0.2 (-3.6 to 4.0) mmHg, respectively. Compared to the average of six PCTs, only 89.5%, 92.1%, and 97.4% of IOP measurements obtained from TV and 78.9%, 73.3%, and 65.8% of IOP measurements obtained from TV+ were within 4 mmHg of the average of six PCTs for first, second, and third PCTs, respectively. In conclusion, the measurement of IOP in the first PCT achieved best agreement with the IOP measurement of six average PCTs. Therefore, the first PCT could be considered as an alternative option for measuring IOP in horses when obtaining an average of six PCTs is not feasible. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Phenylbutazone (PBZ) is the most commonly used drug to treat symptoms of lameness in horses; however, it is associated with adverse effects such as gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS). Interestingly, many practitioners prescribe omeprazole (OME) concurrently with PBZ to prevent the development of EGUS. However, the efficacy and safety of this practice in Mongolian horses with chronic lameness remain unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effects of a combination of PBZ and OME on chronic lameness in Mongolian horses. Study design: Randomised block experimental design. Methods: Eighteen Mongolian horses with lameness score was ≥3 points, were divided into three treatment groups, with six horses in each group: placebo (CON), PBZ (4.4 mg/kg PO q. 24 h), or PBZ plus OME (4 mg/kg PO q. 24 h; PBZ + OME) in a randomised block design based on the initial lameness score. The horses were treated for 15 days. During this period, weekly gastroscopy, and physiological and biochemical tests were performed. Results: Both PBZ (median 1.0, interquartile range [IQR]: 0.8–1.3; p = 0.01) and PBZ + OME (median 1.0, IQR: 1.0–1.0; p = 0.01) significantly decreased the lameness score compared with before administration. In addition, PBZ significantly increased the equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) score (3.0 ± 0.6, p < 0.001), GT-17 content (293.4 ± 21.8 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and pepsinogen-1 (PG1) content (295.3 ± 38.3 ng/mL, p < 0.001) compared with CON or PBZ + OME. However, it significantly reduced the total protein (53.6 ± 1.5 g/L, p < 0.05) and albumin (25.5 ± 1.8 g/L, p < 0.05) contents. Nevertheless, compared with PBZ, PBZ + OME significantly decreased the EGGD score (0.3 ± 0.5, p < 0.001) and significantly increased the gastric fluid pH (7.3 ± 0.5, p < 0.001), total protein content (62.5 ± 4.6 g/L, p = 0.009), and albumin content (29.4 ± 1.1 g/L, p = 0.004). Meanwhile, they significantly diminished the gastrin 17 (GT-17) (162.0 ± 21.0 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and PG1 (182.4 ± 22.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001) contents. Main limitations: Individual differences in horses were larger, but the sample size was small. There was larger interval between observations for each index. Conclusions: Compared with PBZ alone, PBZ + OME had no therapeutic effect on chronic lameness; however, it reduced the occurrence of EGGD in Mongolian horses. Horses may be protected against chronic lameness and PBZ-induced EGGD by increasing the pH value, decreasing serum PG1 and GT-17 content, and preventing the reduction of myeloperoxidase content. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chronic progressive lymphedema (CPL) is a prevalent and progressive disease in Rhenish German draught horses. The objective of our follow-up study was to evaluate the heritability of this disease in Rhenish German draught horses using pedigree-based and genomic relationship matrices. We employed linear and threshold animal models. Models included the random animal effect and effects of breeding association, coat colour, sex, and age within sex, and farm-related factors, on CPL scores. In addition, we estimated heritabilities in models assuming censoring for data when horses were below an age of 1–15 years. The heritabilities of CPL scores across all ages were 0.595 ± 0.131 and 0.482 ± 0.105 in the threshold and linear animal model with pedigree-based relationship matrices, respectively. The restriction of data to horses with a minimum age at examination or accounting for censored data in younger animals showed an increase in heritabilities of CPL scores up to 0.788 ± 0.168 (threshold model) and 0.752 ± 0.153 (linear model) at an age of 7–8 years. Analyses including genomic relationship matrices yielded very similar estimates, but with smaller standard errors than pedigree-based analyses. Heritabilities in threshold models for CPL prevalence (CPL-bin-score) and the number of affected limbs (CPL-bin-sum) were 0.176–0.189 ± 0.061–0.064 and 0.375–0.433 ± 0.164–0.170, respectively. We were able to show moderately to highly positive genetic correlations between the CPL score and cannon bone circumference (0.529–0.825), height at withers (0.338–0.555), and skinfold thickness (0.241–0.517). Using the dichotomous trait for the CPL score and the genomic relationship matrix resulted in corresponding estimates of 0.868, 0.793, and 0.784, respectively. This study showed the great importance of additive genetic variation influencing the expression of chronic progressive lymphedema in Rhenish German draught horses. Therefore, further research is warranted to implement breeding programmes in a small breeding population that exploit the potential of additive genetic differences among animals for reducing the prevalence and severity of lesions of this incurable disease. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Peritoneal fluid lactate concentration is an important diagnostic tool in horses with abdominal pain. Information on peritoneal lactate concentrations is lacking following parturition in the mare. Objectives: To compare blood and peritoneal lactate concentrations in a population of mares within 36 h post-partum, report a normal reference range and identify any impact of retained foetal membranes (RFMs). Methods: This is a retrospective study evaluating healthy mares from which blood and peritoneal samples had been obtained within 36 h of parturition. Exclusion criteria included signs of abdominal pain within this period. Data was interrogated for normality using a Shapiro–Wilk test. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Bland–Altman analysis were used to compare blood and peritoneal lactate concentrations. Linear regression was used to compare age and breed data with peritoneal lactate concentrations. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results: Forty mares met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 12.6 ± 4.1 years, and most mares were multiparous (65%). Peritoneal lactate ((1.2 (IQR = 0.9–1.6) mmol/L) was increased compared to blood lactate concentration (0.7 (IQR = 0–1.1)mmol/L; p < 0.001). Plasma total protein (TP) concentrations were 68 (IQR = 64–74) g/L and peritoneal protein concentrations 8 (IQR = 4–9.7) g/L. Six mares developed RFM. The median fold-increase in peritoneal lactate concentration compared to blood lactate concentration was 0.9 (IQR: 0.01–1.7; range: 0–2.5). The reference range for peritoneal fluid lactate concentration was 0–2.5 mmol/L. Conclusion: Peritoneal lactate concentrations in healthy post-partum mares remained within the normal reference range and were not influenced by RFM or parturition. Increased peritoneal lactate in this group warrants further investigation. © 2024 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms combined with the ever-draining antibiotic pipeline poses a disturbing and immensely growing public health challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach and the application of novel therapies aimed at unconventional targets and/or applying innovative drug formulations. Hence, bacterial iron acquisition systems and bacterial Fe2+/3+-containing enzymes have been identified as a plausible target of great potential. The intriguing “Trojan horse” approach deprives microorganisms from the essential iron. Recently, gallium’s potential in medicine as an iron mimicry species has attracted vast attention. Different Ga3+ formulations exhibit diverse effects upon entering the cell and thus supposedly have multiple targets. The aim of the current study is to specifically distinguish characteristics of great significance in regard to the initial gallium-based complex, allowing the alien cation to effectively compete with the native ferric ion for binding the siderophores pyochelin and pyoverdine secreted by the bacterium P. aeruginosa. Therefore, three gallium-based formulations were taken into consideration: the first-generation gallium nitrate, Ga(NO3)3, metabolized to Ga3+-hydrated forms, the second-generation gallium maltolate (tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyronato)gallium), and the experimentally proven Ga carrier in the bloodstream—the protein transferrin. We employed a reliable in silico approach based on DFT computations in order to understand the underlying biochemical processes that govern the Ga3+/Fe3+ rivalry for binding the two bacterial siderophores. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Gastric ulceration is frequent in adult horses, bringing significant economic and welfare implications to these animals. Treatment may employ several drugs, but adsorbents, such as activated charcoal, are not mentioned. Activated charcoal may be a valuable therapeutic option mainly because of its few adverse effects, fecal elimination, and low cost. This study aimed to evaluate the use of activated charcoal in experimentally induced gastric ulceration in horses and perform the microscopic characterization of charcoal particles in the injured epithelium. Five adult, undefined breed horses underwent a gastric ulcer induction protocol based on alternating fasting and free food access periods. Next, we performed a gastroscopic examination and applied activated charcoal diluted in water at the ulcers through a probe passed through the working channel of the gastroscope. The gastric mucosa was washed with water after a contact period of 5 min until the complete lack of macroscopic product visualization. Then, we performed a biopsy of the aglandular mucosa in erosive to ulcerative injury sites and a microscopic assessment of the fragments. Macroscopically, all animals presented ulcerative lesions in the greater or lesser gastric curvature along the margo plicatus and hyperkeratosis in the aglandular portion. Microscopically, all animals had hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, epithelial erosion, desquamated epithelial cells, inflammatory cells, and variable amounts of charcoal particles, either free or adhered to the epithelium. We concluded that activated charcoal remains adhered to aglandular gastric lesions in horses even after lavage with water and histological processing, allowing its microscopic visualization. Therefore, activated charcoal’s effectiveness as a therapy for equine gastric lesions warrants evaluation. © 2024, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia.

ABSTRACT: Background: Fatigue and related injuries to the musculoskeletal system are among the most frequent reasons for the withdrawal of high-level eventing horses from the sport. The safety of both horse and rider is very important, and early detection of fatigue is crucial. Objectives: To investigate elite eventing horses in competitive events focusing on biomechanical, cardiovascular and metabolic variables across the cross-country test and to identify their potential associations with fatigue. Study design: Prospective observational exploratory field study. Methods: Observations on 54 cross-country tests of 33 horses at five competitive, high-level events were evaluated using sternal accelerometric analysis of stride parameters between and at the jumps. Blood lactate concentration and heart rate were determined 10 min after finishing. The differences in kinematic parameters between the course start and end were analysed with mixed models for repeated measures. Associations between blood lactate and heart rate recovery with the kinematic variables were quantified with Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: We observed numerous stride characteristics between the jumps and the jumps changing over time during the courses. Blood lactate concentrations were positively correlated with the mean maximal strike power at the jumps in the last minute of the course (r = 0.41; p < 0.001), and the latter was negatively correlated with the mean stride height over the jumps (r = −0.41; p = 0.003). Main limitations: The sample contained horses of varying breeds, sexes and ages, and different horses participated in different events. Conclusions: We identified several kinematic changes during a cross-country test depending on event, speed and fatigue. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: There are two FDA-approved bisphosphonate products, clodronate (Osphos®) and tiludronate (Tildren®), for use in horses. It is hypothesized that bisphosphonates can produce analgesic effects and prevent proper healing of microcracks in bone. Therefore, bisphosphonate use is banned in racehorses. However, bisphosphonates have a short detection window in the blood before sequestration in the skeleton, making the reliability of current drug tests questionable. Seven exercising Thoroughbred horses were administered clodronate (1.8 mg/kg i.m.), and four were administered saline. RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected immediately before a single dose of clodronate or saline and then on Days 1, 6, 28, 56 and 182 post-dose. mRNA was sequenced and analysed for differentially expressed transcripts. While no single transcripts were differentially expressed, pathway analysis revealed that p38 MAPK (p =.04) and Ras (p =.04) pathways were upregulated, and cadherin signalling (p =.02) was downregulated on Day 1. Previously investigated biomarkers, cathepsin K (CTSK) and type 5 acid phosphatase (ACP5), were analysed with RT-qPCR in a targeted gene approach, with no significant difference observed. A significant effect of time on gene expression for ACP5 (p =.03) and CTSK (p <.0001) was observed. Thus, these genes warrant further investigation for detecting clodronate use over time. © 2024 The Authors. Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Field triage systems are available to address mass casualty incidents involving humans, but lack for animals caught in disasters. This study aimed to develop, as a proof of principle, an animal field triage protocol for livestock, horses and wildlife based on an existing human triage system. A literature review was completed, resulting in choosing the human SALT triage algorithm as a starting point, followed by an expert consultation using a two-round Delphi study to evaluate and create the final version of the triage protocol. Finally, a group of first responders were familiarized with the protocol and triage injured animals in a simulated disaster environment using a purpose-built training game and provide written feedback. For livestock and horses, consensus was reached on the use of global sorting based on the criteria ‘autonomously mobile without obvious major injuries’, and on five of six appropriate physiological criteria applied for individual health state assessment. Triaged animals were placed in one of four categories developed for applicable veterinary care, being beyond saving (black), immediate/urgent (red), delayed (yellow) and minor (green). The expert panel agreed that the veterinary triage model is probably workable for livestock and horses but not for wildlife, and has added value in natural disasters and mass casualty incidents involving animals. Validation of the protocol with first responders on the usability of the triage protocol as a proof of principle warrants a careful introduction for practical use and further evaluation during disasters affecting livestock and horses in the field. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Equine parvovirus-hepatitis (EqPV-H) is the causative agent of Theiler’s disease, or severe acute hepatic necrosis, in horses. However, it is poorly understood whether EqPV-H is associated with other histologic findings in horses with clinical liver disease. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and severity of EqPV-H infections in diagnostic liver samples. Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver samples (n = 98) from Cornell University and University of California, Davis, collected between 2007 and 2022 were evaluated for 15 individual histologic features and by EqPV-H in situ hybridization. EqPV-H was detected in 48% (n = 47) of samples. The most common histologic features of EqPV-H-positive samples included individual hepatocyte death (n = 40, 85%), lobular infiltrates (n = 38, 80%), portal infiltrates (n = 35, 74%), and ductular reaction (n = 33, 70%). Centrilobular necrosis, portal infiltrate, and individual hepatocyte death were positively associated with high viral load. Neutrophil infiltrates, bridging fibrosis, and portal edema were negatively associated with a high viral load. Only 4 of 49 tested samples were positive for equine hepacivirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the PCR assay was unreliable for FFPE tissues. In summary, this study demonstrates that EqPV-H is common in a variety of liver pathologies and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of hepatitis other than Theiler’s disease. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Objective: Chronic foot pain, a common cause of forelimb lameness, can be treated by palmar digital neurectomy (PDN). Complications include neuroma formation and lameness recurrence. In humans, neuroanastomoses are performed to prevent neuroma formation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of horses undergoing dorsal-to-palmar branch neuroanastomosis following PDN. Study design: Retrospective case series. Animals: Eighty-five horses with PDN and dorsal-to-palmar branch neuroanastomosis. Methods: Medical records for horses undergoing this procedure at two hospitals between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed. Palmar and dorsal nerve branches of the PDN were transected and end-to-end neuroanastomosis was performed by apposition of the perineurium. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone interviews. Success was defined as resolution of lameness for at least one year. Results: Lameness resolved following surgery in 81/85 (95%) horses with 57/84 (68%) sound at one year. Postoperative complications occurred in 19/85 (22%) cases. The main limitations of the study were an incomplete data set, inaccurate owner recall, and variations in procedure. Conclusion: Compared to previous studies, this technique resulted in similar numbers of horses sound immediately after surgery, a comparable rate of postoperative neuroma formation but a higher recurrence of lameness rate at 1 year postoperatively. Clinical significance: End-to-end neuroanastomosis of the dorsal and palmar branches of the PDN does not reduce the rate of neuroma formation in horses. Long-term outcome was less favorable compared to previously reported PDN techniques. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Background: Lymph nodes are routinely assessed ultrasonographically in humans and small animals. The ultrasonographic assessment of equine lymph nodes has only been sporadically reported. Objectives: The aims of this study were to establish anatomical landmarks, ultrasonographic technique and normal ultrasonographic appearance of clinically relevant equine lymph nodes difficult to assess by palpation and to provide a useful reference for equine practitioners. Study design: This was prospective observational study. Methods: Medial retropharyngeal, cranial and caudal deep cervical, and caecal lymph nodes were visualised using transcutaneous ultrasonography in 19 clinically healthy horses, and lymph nodes of the iliosacral lymphocentre were visualised using transrectal ultrasonography in nine horses with no metabolic or infectious disorders. Anatomical landmarks, size and echogenicity were recorded. Results: A total of 268 lymph nodes were visualised and measured in 25 horses. Lymph nodes were ovoid with regular contour and homogeneous parenchyma, hypoechoic to isoechoic to the surrounding tissue. The visualised lymph nodes of the sacroiliac lymphocentre were the smallest (mean ± standard deviation: 2.4 ± 0.9 × 5.9 ± 1.8 mm), and the largest were the caudal deep cervical lymph nodes (mean ± standard deviation: 5.1 ± 1.9 × 10.9 ± 5.6 mm). The short-to-long-axis ratio varied from 0.44 to 0.60 among the lymph nodes examined. Main limitations: Normality of lymph nodes was not confirmed by histopathology. Conclusions: This study describes the ultrasonographic technique, anatomical landmarks and appearance of presumptively normal medial retropharyngeal, cranial and caudal deep cervical, caecal lymph nodes and caudal lymph nodes of the iliosacral lymphocentre. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine neuroaxonal dystrophy/degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects young, genetically predisposed horses that are deficient in vitamin E. Equine NAD/EDM has not previously been documented in Gypsy Vanner horses (GVs). Objectives: To evaluate: (1) the clinical phenotype, blood vitamin E concentrations before and after supplementation and pedigree in a cohort of GV horses with a high prevalence of neurologic disease suspicious for eNAD/EDM and (2) to confirm eNAD/EDM in GVs through postmortem evaluation. Animals: Twenty-six GVs from 1 farm in California and 2 cases from the Midwestern U.S. Methods: Prospective observational study on Californian horses; all 26 GVs underwent neurologic examination. Pre-supplementation blood vitamin E concentration was assessed in 17- GVs. Twenty-three were supplemented orally with 10 IU/kg of liquid RRR-alpha-tocopherol once daily for 28 days. Vitamin E concentration was measured in 23 GVs after supplementation, of which 15 (65%) had pre-supplementation measurements. Two clinically affected GVs from California and the 2 Midwestern cases had necropsy confirmation of eNAD/EDM. Results: Pre-supplementation blood vitamin E concentration was ≤2.0 μg/mL in 16/17 (94%) of GVs from California. Post-supplementation concentration varied, with a median of 3.39 μg/mL (range, 1.23-13.87 μg/mL), but only 12/23 (52%) were normal (≥3.0 μg/mL). Normalization of vitamin E was significantly associated with increasing age (P =.02). Euthanized horses (n = 4) had eNAD/EDM confirmed at necropsy. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: GVs could have a genetic predisposition to eNAD/EDM. Vitamin E supplementation should be considered and monitored in young GVs. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a feed additive obtained from the dried leaves of Ginkgo biloba L. (ginkgo extract) when used as a sensory additive in feed for horses, dogs, cats, rabbits and guinea pigs. Ginkgo extract contains ≥ 24% total flavonoids, ≥ 6% total terpene lactones and ≤ 1 mg/kg ginkgolic acids. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) concluded that ginkgo extract is safe for the target species at the following concentrations in complete feed: 2.8 mg/kg for horses and cats, 1.1 mg/kg for rabbits and guinea pigs, and 3.3 mg/kg for dogs. No safety concern would arise for the consumers from the use of ginkgo extract up to the highest level in feed which is considered safe for food-producing species (horses and rabbits). The additive should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes, and as a dermal and respiratory sensitiser. The use of the additive at the proposed level in feed for the target species is not considered to be a risk to the environment. While the available data indicate that Ginkgo preparations have a distinctive flavour profile, there is no evidence that the ginkgo extract would impart flavour to a food or feed matrix. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the efficacy of the additive. © 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV-1) infection in horses is associated with upper respiratory disease, neurological disease, abortions, and neonatal death. Objective: To determine if there is an association between the level and duration of EHV-1 viremia and either abortion or equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in domesticated horses?. Methods: A systematic review was performed searching numerous databases to identify peer reviewed reports that evaluated viremia and EHM, or viremia and abortion published before January 19, 2021. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies were assessed for risk of bias or publication quality. Results: A total of 189 unique studies were identified, of which 34 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty studies evaluated viremia and neurologic outcomes including 4 observational studies. Eight experimental studies examined viremia and abortion, which used the Ab4 and OH03 virus strains or recombinant Ab4 derivatives. Incidence rates for both EHM and abortion in experimental studies varied among the studies as did the level of evidence. Viremia was generally detectable before the onset of either EHM or abortion. Risk of bias was generally low to moderate, sample sizes were small, and multiple studies reported negative outcome data. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The results of this study support that viremia is regularly present before EHM or abortion occurs. However, no inferences could be made about the relationship between the occurrence of either neurological signs or abortion and the magnitude or duration of viremia. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Horse welfare assessment (HWA) does not account for individual or herd parasite infection. This study investigated the connection between HWA and individual parasite fecal egg count (FEC) in 90 Thoroughbred horses. All horses were naturally infected with gastrointestinal parasites and were evaluated for individual welfare indicators and FEC monthly, for 12 months. Horses were divided into three groups of 30 mares, 30 foals aged between 13 and 16 months (G2013), and 30 foals aged between two months and one year (G2014). A horse welfare protocol was developed and 1024 assessments were carried out by five trained assessors. FEC ranged from 0 to 5,760 with 98.8 % showing small strongyle eggs. Body condition scores were ideal in 94.4 % of the evaluations (n = 967), and 95.8 % of all horses had good clinical and behavioral indicators. Despite the variation in FEC, the data found no significant association between FEC and the behavioral indicators. The study suggests that FEC alone should not be used as a determinant of welfare when animals are managed with good nutritional and health management practices. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Horses are sensitive to feed hygiene change. Commercial products are expected to be clean and safe but substandard storage conditions could compromise the nutritional and hygienic quality. We assessed changes in the nutritional and hygienic properties of common cereals (oat, maize and barley) in native (whole) and processed (flaked) forms in response to storage conditions. Commercially bagged cereals for horses were subjected to 3 storage conditions: freshly opened (control), open-bag storage and sealed-bag storage for 42 d kept in a feed storage room of a privately owned horse farm. The temperature and relative humidity of the storage room ranged from 17 to 21 °C and 58–74%, respectively. Two samples were taken from the top and bottom positions of each bag (total n = 36) for analyses. Microscopic evaluations showed that oat samples contained 3–5 times higher numbers of impurities than maize and barley. Maize samples were highest in the number of flawed grains, while barley showed the greatest number of pest components. High counts of impurities, flawed grains and pest components were already found in the control samples, and the storage conditions did not promote more damage and contaminants or alter the chemical composition of samples. Sensory evaluation did not detect differences among samples. Processing enlarged the particle size of all grain sorts and promoted physical damage to maize in particular. Five samples analyzed for mycotoxins and other contaminants revealed the prevalence of secondary metabolites of Fusarium and Alternaria spp. (each group showing 80% frequency and >500 μg/kg). Ergot alkaloids were absent. Fumonisin B1 and B2 were exclusively detected in maize samples (max concentration = 267 and 36 μg/kg, respectively) and pesticide residues in barley samples. Our data indicate specific impurities, damages and contaminants associated with certain grain sort and processing with little impact of the test storage conditions. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Dental-related sinusitis is a common condition in horses and often involves polymicrobial infection. Tooth extraction followed by sinus lavage and debridement are the recommended treatment. However, infection may persist or recur due to incomplete removal of infected material or, in rare cases, potential antimicrobial resistance. Although the use of antibiotics may be considered, evidence supporting their indication is scarce. This systematic literature review sets out to examine existing evidence supporting the use of antimicrobial therapy in dental-related sinusitis in horses. Five articles (retrospective studies, prospective studies and case series) were included. Doxycycline, sulphadiazine-trimethoprim, metronidazole and procaine benzylpenicillin combined with neomycin were the most commonly used antimicrobials. Oxytetracycline, gentamicin and cephazolin were used to a lesser extent. Two or more active pharmaceutical substances were often combined. In all studies, antimicrobial therapy was used as an ancillary strategy and criteria for drug selection were not reported. This review highlighted the scarcity of evidence supporting the use of antimicrobials in horses with dental-related sinusitis. In cases with positive clinical outcomes, it was not possible to determine whether clinical improvement was due to antibiotics or other therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the actual contribution of antimicrobials could not be established. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Analyzing social networks is a powerful tool for understanding the ecology of social species. While most studies focus on the role of each group member, few compare groups with different characteristics. The current population of Przewalski's horses Equus ferus przewalskii at the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area (Mongolia) includes groups of wild-born and captive-bred individuals with different experiences with the area (acclimatizing, long-term reintroduced, and wild-born), therefore serving as an ideal natural behavioral lab. We filmed 11 groups for 141.5 hours in summer 2018 (July), late spring 2019 (May, June), and autumn 2019 (September, October). Affiliative and agonistic interactions were recorded, and social networks were created. We tested the influence of origin, experience, season, sex, age, relative time belonging to the group, relatedness, and dominance rank on different network indices at the individual and group levels. We found that groups with greater experience in the area are generally better connected than members of the newly formed groups. However, these strong networks were created by wild-born individuals with very low interaction rates. On the contrary, inexperienced groups composed of captive-bred individuals displayed many interactions but created weak social networks. The results show a trend of behavioral transition from acclimatizing through long-term reintroduced to wild-born groups, supporting that the newly formed groups of released Przewalski's horses need time to display the typical social behavior patterns of wild-born individuals. Long-term monitoring of released Przewalski's horses is recommended to promote the success of this reintroduction program.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Evaluate a prototype dynamic laryngoplasty system (DLPS) in horses; a feasibility study. ANIMALS 7 healthy Standardbred adult horses. METHODS This was an in vivo experimental study. Horses had a standing surgical procedure to induce complete laryngeal hemiplegia, which was subsequently treated using the dynamic laryngoplasty system (DLPS). Activation of the DLPS was achieved using an injection port exiting through the skin (n = 2) or a subcutaneous injection port (n = 5). For each horse, endoscopic examinations of the upper respiratory tract were performed preoperatively, intraoperatively, and 7 days postoperatively. Left-to-right quotient ratios calculated during inactivated and activated states were obtained from still images of the rima glottidis acquired during day 7. In 3 horses, the device was intentionally overinflated to evaluate for device failure, and postmortem examinations were performed on day 7. For the remaining 4 horses, upper respiratory tract endoscopy was repeated at 1 month postoperatively, with no subsequent postmortem exam. RESULTS No perioperative complications occurred, and the DLPS was effectively delivered in all horses under standing sedation. The left-to-right quotient ratio at day 7 postoperatively could be altered from a resting position of 0.76 (± 0.06) to a maximum of 0.97 (± 0.06; P < .05). The degree of arytenoid abduction could not be significantly altered after 1 month of device implantation, suspected to be due to peri-implant fibrosis. No coughing nor tracheal contamination was observed at all time points or during inflation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The ability to alter the degree of abduction at 7 days postoperatively with the DLPS may be beneficial in selective cases. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a tincture from the roots of Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. (ginseng tincture), when used as a sensory additive in feed for horses, dogs and cats. The product is a water/ethanol (40:60 v/v) solution, with a dry matter content of no more than 6% and a content of 0.01%–0.5% (w/w) for the sum of the two triterpene saponins ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rg1. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) concluded that the tincture is safe for horses, dogs and cats at the maximum proposed use level of 48.6, 228.7 and 162 mg/kg complete feed, respectively. The Panel also concluded that the additive is considered safe for consumers when used at the proposed conditions of use in feed for horses. Ginseng tincture should be considered as an irritant to skin and eyes, and as a dermal and respiratory sensitiser. The use of the ginseng tincture as a flavour in feed for horses was not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since the roots of P. ginseng and its preparations were recognised to flavour food and their function in feed would be essentially the same, no demonstration of efficacy was considered necessary. © 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

ABSTRACT: Background: In 2020, a novel neurologic disease was observed in juvenile Quarter Horses (QHs) in North America. It was unknown if this was an aberrant manifestation of another previously described neurological disorder in foals, such as equine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM). Hypothesis/Objectives: To describe the clinical findings, outcomes, and postmortem changes with Equine Juvenile Spinocerebellar Ataxia (EJSCA), differentiate the disease from other similar neurological disorders, and determine a mode of inheritance. Animals: Twelve neurologically affected QH foals and the dams. Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated and pedigrees were manually constructed. Results: All foals (n = 12/12) had a history of acute onset of neurological deficits with no history of trauma. Neurological deficits were characterized by asymmetrical spinal ataxia, with pelvic limbs more severely affected than thoracic limbs. Clinicopathological abnormalities included high serum activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase and hyperglycemia. All foals became recumbent (median, 3 days: [0–18 days]), which necessitated humane euthanasia (n = 11/12, 92%; the remaining case was found dead). Histological evaluation at postmortem revealed dilated myelin sheaths and digestion chambers within the spinal cord, most prominently in the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts. Pedigree analysis revealed a likely autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: EJSCA is a uniformly fatal, rapidly progressive, likely autosomal recessive neurological disease of QHs <1 month of age in North America that is etiologically distinct from other clinically similar neurological disorders. Once the causative variant for EJSCA is validated, carriers can be identified through genetic testing to inform breeding decisions. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: After submaximal exercise, blood values of eventing horses show physiological reactions. Objectives: This prospective longitudinal study investigated blood parameters in 20 elite eventing horses before and after two–four-star cross-country rides. Methods: Using a mixed model adjusting for plasma volume shift, we assessed exercise-dependent parameters and compared blood values with reference ranges for healthy horses at rest. Results: Following exercise, cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) showed short-term increases, and superoxide-dismutase showed a small short-term increase. Hepatic values showed short-term (haemoglobin [HGB], globulins) or sustained increases (bilirubin, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase). Digestion-related parameters showed small short-term increases (α-amylase, triglycerides) or decreases (cholesterol, DGGR-lipase), apparent through plasma shift adjustment. Zinc decreased in the short term, and iron showed a delayed decrease. White blood cell count increased persistently after training, whereas serum amyloid A remained unchanged. Conclusions: Exercised eventing horses had consistently elevated HGB and cortisol levels 10 and 30 min after submaximal exercise, exceeding the reference ranges for healthy horses at rest. Exercise activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical and hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axes. Antioxidant activity was observed. Increased energy requirements led to the mobilization of energy reserves, and a sustained increase in liver enzymes indicated hepatocellular injury. Mild haemolysis suggested increased muscle metabolism, whereas signs of inflammation were subtle. Further research is needed to identify which horses deviate from mean values. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV-1) infection in horses is associated with upper respiratory disease, neurological disease, abortions, and neonatal death. Review Question: Does pharmacological therapy decrease either the incidence or severity of disease or infection caused by EHV-1 in domesticated horses?. Methods: A systematic review was preformed searching AGRICOLA, CAB Abstracts, Cochrane, PubMed, Web of Science, and WHO Global Health Index Medicus Regional Databases to identify articles published before February 15, 2021. Selection criteria were original research reports published in peer reviewed journals, and studies investigating in vivo use of therapeutic agents for prevention or treatment of EHV-1 in horses. Outcomes assessed included measures related to clinical outcomes that reflect symptomatic EHV-1 infection or virus infection. We evaluated risk of bias and performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. Results: A total of 7009 unique studies were identified, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Two studies evaluated valacyclovir or small interfering RNAs, and single studies evaluated the use of a Parapoxvirus ovis-based immunomodulator, human alpha interferon, an herbal supplement, a cytosine analog, and heparin. The level of evidence ranged between randomized controlled studies and observational trials. The risk of bias was moderate to high and sample sizes were small. Most studies reported either no benefit or minimal efficacy of the intervention tested. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Our review indicates minimal or limited benefit either as a prophylactic or post-exposure treatment for any of the studied interventions in the mitigation of EHV-1-associated disease outcome. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Sinoscopy consists of direct visualisation of the paranasal sinuses and was first conceived for diagnostic purposes using a rigid endoscope through a skull trephination. Since then, the use and approaches to perform it have evolved thanks to current advancements in knowledge (sinus anatomy and pathology) and technology. The aim of this article is to review the techniques reported to perform traditional and minimally invasive sinoscopy and to review the current use of sinoscopy to treat paranasal sinus disease. The history of sinoscopy, as we know it today, is relatively recent, but its use among clinicians is not necessarily widespread despite the invasiveness of the traditional technique when compared to imaging techniques. This limitation could be bypassed using the newer intranasal or extranasal minimally invasive sinoscopic approaches. These techniques allowed sinoscopic visualisation through natural orifices or minimally invasively created openings. Despite the potential of these techniques, case selection is still crucial as visualisation can be limited in selected disorders (i.e. sinus cyst), some sinuses (i.e. rostral maxillary with intranasal approaches) and if haemorrhage or severe exudate accumulation is found. Nevertheless, sinoscopy offers a diagnostic rate superior to traditional imaging and it is an alternative diagnostic tool when advanced imaging techniques, such as CT, are not available. In recent years, sinoscopic treatment has been progressively replacing the use of sinusotomies to treat most sinus disorders. Sinoscopic treatment yields a high-resolution rate while complications are kept low. Familiarisation with sinoscopic techniques and in-depth anatomic sinus knowledge will likely make sinoscopy the gold standard technique to treat sinus disease in the near future. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is an ocular disorder characterized by nyctalopia. An autosomal recessive missense mutation in glutamate metabotropic receptor 6 (GRM6 c.533C>T, p.(Thr178Met)), called CSNB2, was previously identified in one Tennessee Walking Horse and predicted to reduce binding affinity of the neurotransmitter glutamate, impacting the retinal rod ON-bipolar cell signaling pathway. Thus, the first aim was to identify the allele frequency (AF) of CSNB2 in breeds with reported cases of CSNB and breeds closely related to the Tennessee Walking Horse. The second aim was to perform ocular examinations in multiple breeds to confirm the link between genotype and CSNB phenotype. In evaluating 3518 horses from 14 breeds, the CSNB2 allele was identified in nine previously unreported breeds. The estimated AF was highest in pacing Standardbreds (0.17) and lowest in American Quarter Horses (0.0010). Complete ophthalmic examinations and electroretinograms (ERG) were performed on 19 horses from three breeds, including one CSNB2 homozygote from each breed. All three CSNB2/CSNB2 horses had an electronegative ERG waveform under scotopic light conditions consistent with CSNB. The remaining 16 horses (seven CSNB2/N and nine N/N) had normal scotopic ERG results. All horses had normal photopic ERGs. This study provides additional evidence that GRM6 c.533C>T homozygosity is likely causal to CSNB in Tennessee Walking Horses, Standardbreds, and Missouri Fox Trotting Horses. Genetic testing is recommended for breeds with the CSNB2 allele to limit the production of affected horses. This study represents the largest across-breed identification of CSNB in the horse and suggests that this disorder is likely underdiagnosed. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Incisional complications following ventral midline celiotomy represent a challenge for equine surgeons. Preventative measures to minimise risks of incisional complications are continuously being investigated. This includes the search for an ideal surgical closure method. Objective: To compare the incidence of incisional complications after skin closure with nylon sutures versus stainless-steel skin staples (SSS) following ventral midline celiotomy for colic surgery in horses and to assess additional risk factors for incisional complications. Study design: Prospective blinded randomised study (2012–2014). Methods: One hundred and twenty-three horses that underwent colic surgery between May 2012 and May 2014 and survived for >2 weeks were included in the study. Horses were allocated randomly to two groups—65 horses were closed with skin staples, and 58 horses were closed with skin sutures (nylon-0). Patient records and a follow-up questionnaire were used to record incisional complications that occurred during hospitalisation and after discharge. Results: Follow-up information was available in 119 of 123 horses. Four horses without follow-up were excluded. With strict inclusion criteria, incisional drainage was recorded in 43% (49/115) of the horses, including 40% (25/63) of the surgical staples skin closure group and 46% (24/52) of the nylon suture skin closure group. Pregnancy and large colon intestinal lesions were risk factors for incisional complications. Surgeon 3 was found to decrease the incidence of incisional infection. No association was detected between incisional complications and hernia development. Main limitations: The non-uniformity of the follow-up examination; reliance on owners or caregiver of the horse for follow-up information, horses lost to follow-up, incomplete data. Another limitation was the single-centre design of the study. Conclusions: Although not significantly superior, the use of staples may serve as a valid alternative for ventral midline abdominal incision skin closure. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Limb-conformation defects significantly influence equine performance and welfare, necessitating thorough investigation for effective management. This study examines the prevalence and genetic parameters of 14 limb-conformation defects in Menorca Purebred horses using data from 1120 records (509 animals with an average age of 101.87 ± 1.74 months) collected between 2015 and 2023. Defects were evaluated using a three-class scale by three appraisers, and a Bayesian approach via Gibbs sampling was employed to estimate genetic parameters including gender, birth period, stud selection criteria, evaluation age and appraiser as fixed effects. Splay-footed forelimb and closed hocks were the most prevalent defects (67.20% and 62.53%, respectively). Horses with any of the defects analyzed have been observed to obtain significantly lower scores for both walk and trot. Heritability estimates range from 0.12 (s.d.: 0.025) for closed hock to 0.30 (s.d.: 0.054) for base narrow, confirming the genetic influences on the expression of limb conformation defects. The divergent defect in hind limbs showed the highest genetic correlations with forelimb defects (camped under, −0.69; s.d: 0.32 and camped out, 0.70; s.d: 0.27). The significant genetic correlations between defects highlight the complexity of the relationships, which requires careful consideration. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This case report describes septic suturitis as a likely cause of periapical dental disease in a 3-year-old Thoroughbred colt. The horse was presented for a unilateral sinusitis initially managed by a frontal osteotomy and sinus lavage and subsequently developed a septic suturitis. Subsequently, a computed tomography (CT) examination identified a periapical infection of cheek tooth 109 with associated sinusitis of the rostral sinus compartments and an extensive suturitis, with the most severe changes located at the right nasomaxillary suture line. There was an associated local fistulous tract rostral to the mesial periapical region of cheek tooth 107 but unassociated with typical periapical or endodontic dental disease changes on CT. The sinusitis did not respond to oral extraction of cheek tooth 109 and sinus lavage. A repeat head CT 2 weeks later, now revealed buccal alveolar bone loss surrounding cheek tooth 107 with obvious periodontal and endodontic dental disease changes. Oral extraction of cheek tooth 107 was performed and local curettage of the fistulous tract was conducted. We conclude that septic suturitis can become extensive and slow to resolve and its rostral extension can cause periapical infection of the closely associated rostral cheek teeth in young horses. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Surgical approaches to the equine rectum and perirectal area are described in the literature. However, surgeries in this region can be challenging. Objective: To describe the surgical anatomy of the presacral space and to evaluate its access using a retroperitoneoscopic approach. Study design: Ex vivo experiment. Methods: Preliminary dissections were performed in two cadavers to define the boundaries of the presacral space and to determine portal locations for the surgical approach. After that, nine cadavers were used for experimental presacral retroperitoneoscopic procedure in a standing position. Following retroperitoneoscopy, cadavers were dissected to confirm the anatomical structures observed during the endoscopic procedures, to control the location of each portal and to record iatrogenic trauma. Results: The presacral space was bordered by the vertebral column from the ventral aspect of lumbosacral promontorium to the first coccygeal vertebra dorsally and by the presacral fascia and peritoneum ventrally. Lateral limits were composed of the sacrosciatic ligament and transversalis fascia. Cranial and caudal borders were composed of the peritoneum and coccygeal and levator ani muscles respectively. Retroperitoneoscopic portals were placed between the external anal sphincter and semimembranosus muscles and between the base of the tail and the external anal sphincter muscle through the anococcygeal fascia to enter the space by its caudal border. The retroperitoneal space was reached in all cases and the dorsal and lateral aspects of the rectum were visualised after creation of a working space. Main limitations: Use of cadaver specimens do not permit to evaluate the tolerance in living animals and the surgical complications such as rectal damage, haemorrhage and infection. Conclusion: This study provides an anatomical description and surgical access of the presacral space with a minimal invasive approach. Retroperitoneoscopy allows access to the rectum and the dorsal aspect of the pelvis. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The aims of the present study were to identify strongyles in the feces of Thoroughbred horses based on larval morphology; to detect Strongylus vulgaris using molecular diagnosis and compare results to those of feces culture; and to determine the association between the presence of S. vulgaris with corresponding animal information (age range, gender, and anthelmintic use). Feces of horses kept in six Training Centers in Rio de Janeiro State, that showed the presence of ≥500 eggs per gram of feces (EPG) were subjected to strongyle identification. Of the 520 fecal samples collected, 35 had an EPG ≥ 500. After fecal culture for L3 larvae identification, DNA was extracted, subjected to PCR to amplify the ITS2 region DNA fragment of S. vulgaris, and sequenced. A total of 3500 larvae were analyzed. Most were classified as small strong (99.7%), with an emphasis on the type A subfamily of Cyathostominae. Forms of S. vulgaris only corresponded to 0.2%. In all, 25 samples showed amplified S. vulgaris DNA products and 11 showed nucleotide sequences with high sequence identity. Fecal culture and PCR results showed poor agreement (kappa = 0.105) for S. vulgaris diagnosis. Age, gender, anthelmintic use, and anthelmintic administration interval were not statistically significant. The present study showed the presence of S. vulgaris in the feces of horses kept in Rio de Janeiro Training Centers, mainly seen via PCR, which has emerged as the most effective tool for diagnosis. This study made it possible to identify strongyles that infect horses in the region, emphasizing upon the necessity for constant monitoring of the animals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Quarter horses (QH), a prominent athletic breed in Brazil, are affected by muscular genetic disorders such as myosin-heavy chain myopathy (MYHM), polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyPP), and malignant hyperthermia (MH). Bull-catching (vaquejada), primarily involving QH, is a significant equestrian sport in Brazil. Since the allele frequencies (AF) of MYHM, PSSM1, HyPP, and MH in vaquejada QH remain unknown, this study evaluated the AF in 129 QH vaquejada athletes, specifically from the Brazilian Northeast. These variants were exclusively observed in heterozygosity. The MYHM exhibited the highest AF (0.04 ±0.01), followed by PSSM1 (0.01 ±0.01) and the HyPP variant (0.004 ±0.01), while the MH variant was not identified in this study. This study represents the first identification of these variants in vaquejada QH, emphasizing the need to implement measures to prevent the transmission of pathogenic alleles and reduce the occurrence of clinical cases of these genetic diseases. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In stabled horses, several behaviours are considered to be important indicators of the state of welfare at the individual level: stereotypies, aggressive behaviours towards humans and the “withdrawn”, alert, sternal, lateral and observation postures. Until now, these behaviours have been extensively studied in relation to different horse management practices. However, little is known about their changes or consistency over time. This study aimed to investigate differences in the expression of these behaviours assessed on 44 stabled horses during an initial 3-month period and then again on the same individuals 2 years later. Out of the six behaviours studied, two showed significant differences between the 2 years with medium effect sizes: the levels of aggressiveness towards humans increased (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V = 65, P = 0.005) and those of recumbent rest during the day decreased (V = 416, P < 0.001) over time. The results also suggested limited evidence of major changes over time in the expression of stereotypies, the “withdrawn”, alert and observation postures. However, the principal component analyses carried out on all the behaviours showed that alert and observation postures may slightly decrease over time for some individuals. Regarding stereotypies and the “withdrawn” posture, the results mainly suggested a change at the individual level in the expression of these behaviours over time. This study provided new insights into the dynamic nature of several behaviours when the horses' living conditions are not fundamentally altered and raised hypotheses about the state of welfare of stabled individuals over a 2-year period. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To compare the quality of recovery in horses emerging from general anesthesia with or without the assistance of a novel device (recovery-enhancing device [RED]) designed to minimize high-energy falls. ANIMALS 20 mixed-breed horses, between July 1, 2023, and January 24, 2024. METHODS A computer-controlled belay system designed to slow the acceleration of a horse during a fall was evaluated in this study. Horses were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: RED (belay, assisted) or FREE (unassisted). An inertia-measuring unit was fitted to all horses and data were live streamed and recorded onto a computer for further analysis. Recoveries were scored using the composite grading scale (CGS; 0 to 100) by 3 independent observers. Two additional unitless recovery scores (RS and RS’), based on accelerometry values (high accelerations, less desirable), were calculated for each recovery. All the recovery scores were compared between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS Composite grading scale scores were 26 ± 10 and 46 ± 13 in the RED and FREE groups, respectively (P = .001). The RS was 120 ± 79 and 198 ± 34 for the RED and FREE treatment groups, respectively (P = .015). The RS’ was 32 (7 to 50) and 46 (28 to 44) for the RED and FREE treatment groups, respectively (P = .038). CLINICAL RELEVANCE The RED improves the recovery scores compared with unassisted recoveries. This device may lead to a potential reduction in the number and severity of injuries in horses and personnel involved during the recovery period. © 2024 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: The prevalence of gastric disorders in high-performance horses, especially gastric ulceration, ranges from 50 to 90%. These pathological conditions have negative impacts on athletic performance and health. This study was designed to evaluate changes in gastric pH during a 24 h period and to compare gastrin concentrations at different time points in horses undergoing general inhalation anesthesia and dorsal recumbency. Twenty-two mixed-breed mares weighing 400 ± 50 kg and aged 8 ± 2 years were used. Of these, eight were fasted for 8 h and submitted to 90 min of general inhalation anesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Gastric juice samples were collected prior to anesthesia (T0), and then at 15 min intervals during anesthesia (T15–T90). After recovery from anesthesia (45 ± 1 min), samples were collected every hour for 24 h (T1 to T24) for gastric juice pH measurement. During this period, mares had free access to Bermuda grass hay and water and were fed a commercial concentrate twice (T4 and T16). In a second group (control), four non-anesthetized mares were submitted to 8 h of fasting followed by nasogastric intubation. Gastric juice samples were then collected at T0, T15, T30, T45, T60, T75, and T90. During this period, mares did not receive food or water. After 45 min, mares had free access to Bermuda grass hay and water, and gastric juice samples were collected every hour for four hours (T1 to T4). In a third group comprising ten non-fasted, non-anesthetized mares with free access to Bermuda grass hay and water, gastric juice samples were collected 30 min after concentrate intake (T0). In anesthetized mares, blood gastrin levels were measured prior to anesthesia (8 h fasting; baseline), during recovery from anesthesia, and 4 months after the anesthetic procedure, 90 min after the morning meal. Mean values of gastric juice pH remained acidic during general anesthesia. Mean pH values were within the physiological range (4.52 ± 1.69) and did not differ significantly between time points (T15–T90; p > 0.05). After recovery from anesthesia, mean gastric pH values increased and remained in the alkaline range throughout the 24 h period of evaluation. Significant differences were observed between T0 (4.88 ± 2.38), T5 (7.08 ± 0.89), T8 (7.43 ± 0.22), T9 (7.28 ± 0.36), T11 (7.26 ± 0.71), T13 (6.74 ± 0.90), and T17 (6.94 ± 1.04) (p < 0.05). The mean gastric juice pH ranged from weakly acidic to neutral or weakly alkaline in all groups, regardless of food and water intake (i.e., in the fasted, non-fasted, and fed states). Mean gastric pH measured in the control group did not differ from values measured during the 24 h post-anesthesia period or in the non-fasted group. Gastrin concentrations increased significantly during the post-anesthetic period compared to baseline (20.15 ± 7.65 pg/mL and 15.15 ± 3.82 pg/mL respectively; p < 0.05). General inhalation anesthesia and dorsal recumbency did not affect gastric juice pH, which remained acidic and within the physiological range. Gastric juice pH was weakly alkaline after recovery from anesthesia and in the fasted and fed states. Serum gastrin levels increased in response to general inhalation anesthesia in dorsal recumbency and were not influenced by fasting. Preventive pharmacological measures are not required in horses submitted to general anesthesia and dorsal recumbency. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine hepacivirus (EqHV, Flaviviridae, hepacivirus) is a small, enveloped RNA virus generally causing sub-clinical hepatitis with occasional fatalities. EqHV is reported in equids worldwide, but for Italy data are limited. To address this, a survey study was set up to estimate prevalence at a national level and among different production categories (equestrian; competition; work and meat; reproduction) and national macro-regions (North, Central, South, and Islands). Data obtained testing 1801 horse serum samples by Real-Time RT PCR were compared within the categories and regions. The NS3 fragment of the PCR-positive samples was sequenced by Sanger protocol for phylogenetic and mutational analysis. The tertiary structure of the NS3 protein was also assessed. The estimated national prevalence was 4.27% [1.97–6.59, 95% CI] and no statistical differences were detected among production categories and macro-regions. The phylogenesis confirmed the distribution in Italy of the three known EqHV subtypes, also suggesting a possible fourth sub-type that, however, requires further confirmation. Mutational profiles that could also affect the NS3 binding affinity to the viral RNA were detected. The present paper demonstrates that EqHV should be included in diagnostic protocols when investigating causes of hepatitis, and in quality control protocols for blood derived products due to its parental transmission. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The risk of P. equorum infection in horses remains critical. Little studies were conducted to investigate prevalence and molecular analysis of P. equorum in Baghdad city, Iraq. In this study traditional detection followed by molecular technique depending on ITS-2 region were used as an attempt to evaluate this nuclear region as a genetic marker to diagnose the parasitic infection. One hundred and thirty-eight fecal samples of horses were collected and examined by direct wet mount smears, floatation method by NaCl. Extraction of genomic material, nested PCR was done followed by phylogenic analysis depending on ITS-2 region performed for the first time in Iraq and genetic substitutions to analyze Iraqi horses. Nested PCR were done after determining the total infection rate 6.52% by conventional technique, including 3.84% in males and 10% in females with significant difference. Highly infection rate 11.42% was recorded in the age group under 2 years and the lower infection rate 4% was found in the age group between 2-4 years with significant difference. The Iraqi isolates were recorded in the Gen Bank under the accession numbers MZ400507.1, MZ400508.1, MZ400509.1, and MZ4005010.1; while, phylogenetic analysis recorded an identity range between 97-100% with China, Australia and USA isolates. P. equorum is more distributed in younger horses than elderly in Baghdad city and ITS-2 region is a certain molecular marker for detection P. equorum isolates in Iraqi horses. © Authors, 2024, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Mosul.

ABSTRACT: Gram-negative metallo-β-lactamase-producing bacteria can be extremely problematic, especially when found to be extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Cefiderocolis a novel antimicrobial that has been shown to overcome most carbapenemases, with very rare resistance reported to date. Within our institution, two multidrug-resistant and one XDR strains were isolated from a patient who recently emigrated from India. Each isolate underwent whole-genome sequencing to resolve plasmids and determine phylogenetics, strain typing, and mechanisms of resistance. The XDR E. coli was ST167, harbored NDM-5, cirA and PBP3 mutations, consistent with cefiderocolresistance. Our study suggests that the NDM region is required in conjunction with cirA and PBP3 mutations. It is not clear why; however, our study did determine a potential novel iron-transport region unique to the cefiderocol-resistantisolate. This is the firstcharacterized cefiderocol-resistantE.coli reported from Canada. Health centers should be on alert for this clone.  © 2024 Barker et al.

ABSTRACT: Difficulty to extubate any patient is not a problem commonly thought of during general anaesthesia. This case report describes some of the factors that lead to this predicament and the successful surgical removal of the endotracheal tube via a tracheostomy. This case report also highlights some of the deficiencies in the clinical practice of veterinary anaesthesia. Further research is required for the selection size criteria of endotracheal tubes in all species and the monitoring of cuff pressures during general anaesthesia. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The ability to perform transvenous temporary cardiac pacing (TV-TP) is critical to stabilize horses with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. Reports of successful TV-TP in horses are limited, and only briefly describe short-term pacing. Objective: To describe temporary, medium-term (24 h) transvenous right ventricular pacing in awake horses using a bipolar torque-directed pacing catheter. Animals: Six healthy adult institutional teaching horses. Methods: Prospective experimental study with 2 immediately successive TV-TP lead placements in each horse with a target location of the RV apex. One placement was performed primarily with echocardiographic guidance and 1 primarily with fluoroscopic guidance. In all placements, corresponding images were obtained with both imaging modalities. Horses were then paced for 24 h, unrestricted in a stall with continuous telemetric ECG monitoring. Echocardiographically determined lead position, episodes of pacing failure in the preceding 6 h, and pacing thresholds were recorded every 6 h. Pacing failure was defined as a period of loss of capture longer than 20 s. Results: Pacing leads were placed with both guidance methods and maintained for 24 h with no complications. Two horses with leads angled caudally in the right ventricular apex had no pacing failure, the remaining 4 horses had varying degrees of loss of capture. Leads located in the right ventricular apex had longer time to pacing failure and lower capture thresholds P < 0.05. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Medium-term TV-TP is feasible and has potential for stabilization of horses with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. Lead position in the right ventricular apex appears optimal. Continuous ECG monitoring is recommended to detect pacing failure. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Early identification of strangulating obstruction (SO) in horses with colic improves outcomes, yet early diagnosis of horses requiring surgery for SO often remains challenging. Objectives: To compare blood and peritoneal fluid l-lactate concentrations, peritoneal:blood l-lactate ratio, peritoneal minus blood (peritoneal-blood) l-lactate concentration and other clinical variables for predicting SO and SO in horses with small intestinal lesions (SO-SI) and then to develop a multivariable model to predict SO and SO-SI. Study design: Retrospective cohort. Methods: A total of 197 equids admitted to a referral institution for colic between 2016 and 2019 that had peritoneal fluid analysis performed at admission were included. Twenty-three admission variables were evaluated individually for the prediction of a SO or SO-SI and then using multivariable logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AUC ROC) were calculated. Results: All variables performed better in the model than individually. The final multivariable model for predicting SO included marked abdominal pain (OR 5.31, CI 1.40–20.18), rectal temperature (OR 0.30, CI 0.14–0.64), serosanguineous peritoneal fluid (OR 35.34, CI 10.10–122.94), peritoneal-blood l-lactate (OR 1.77, CI 1.25–2.51), and peritoneal:blood l-lactate ratio (OR 0.36, CI 0.18–0.72). The AUC ROC was 0.91. The final multivariable model for predicting SO-SI included reflux volume (OR 0.69, CI 0.56–0.86), blood l-lactate concentration (OR 0.43, CI 0.22–0.87), serosanguineous peritoneal fluid (OR 4.99, CI 1.26–19.74), and peritoneal l-lactate concentration (OR 3.77, CI 1.82–7.81). Main limitations: Retrospective, single-hospital study design. Conclusions: Blood and peritoneal fluid l-lactate concentrations should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical variables. The relationship between peritoneal and blood l-lactate concentration for predicting SO or SO-SI was complex when included in a multivariable model. Models to predict SO probably vary based on lesion location. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) card, a cotton-based cellulose membrane impregnated with a chaotropic agent, effectively inactivates infectious microorganisms, lyses cellular material, and fixes nucleic acid. The aim of this study is to assess the stability and detection limit of various RNA viruses, especially the avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and African horse sickness virus (AHSV), on the FTA card, which could significantly impact virus storage and transport practices. To achieve this, each virus dilution was inoculated onto an FTA card and stored at room temperature in plastic bags for durations ranging from 1 week to 6 months. Following storage, the target genome was detected using conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The present study demonstrated that the detection limit of AIV ranged from 1.17 to 6.17 EID50 values over durations ranging from 1 week to 5 months, while for NDV, it ranged from 2.83 to 5.83 ELD50 over the same duration. Additionally, the detection limit of AHSV was determined as 4.01 PFU for both 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. Based on the demonstrated effectiveness, stability, and safety implications observed in the study, FTA cards are recommended for virus storage and transport, thus facilitating the molecular detection and identification of RNA viral pathogens. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We aimed to test the hypothesis that repeated muscle collections would impact mitochondrial function, antioxidant status, and markers of inflammation and muscle damage. Twenty-six horses (8 geldings, 18 mares; mean ± SD 9.5 ± 3.5 y) had gluteus medius muscle biopsy samples collected at: 0 and 24h (n=7); 0 and 6h (n = 6); 0, 6, and 12h (n=7); or 0, 6, 12, and 24h (n=6). Blood was collected from all horses every 6h for 72h, starting 24h prior to the 0h muscle collection. Data were analyzed using mixed linear models. Muscle integrative (per mg tissue) electron transfer capacity of complex II decreased (P=0.004) and intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase (CS) activity) LEAK increased (P<0.03) from 0 to 6h but both returned to 0h levels by 12h. Activity of CS was greater at 0 than 12 and 24h (P≤0.02). Serum creatine kinase (CK) activity was similar from -24 through 0h but increased in all horses at 6h and remained elevated through 48h (P<0.05) though not above reference ranges. Whole blood superoxide dismutase activity fluctuated throughout the 72-h collection period (P=0.03) and serum cortisol concentration displayed a circadian pattern (P<0.0001) but neither were altered by muscle collections. No other variable, including muscle mitochondrial capacities and function, blood and muscle antioxidant status and concentrations of select cytokines, and serum amyloid A, differed by time or muscle collection. Repeated gluteal collections had limited short-term or no effect on physiological markers in unstressed, mature horses except serum CK activity, which should be interpreted with caution during repeated tissue collections. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Trunk injection with imidacloprid is used to reduce the infestation rate of trees by pests. However, further research is needed to determine the insecticide persistence in trees. Here, we present a case study in which we evaluated horse chestnut trees for imidacloprid residues and the invasive leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) infestation 14 years after a single injection (5 mL of pesticide per tree). We detected residues of imidacloprid (on average 0.648 μg/kg in leaves) and its metabolites: imidacloprid-guanidine in leaves and inflorescences and imidacloprid-urea in the leaves of treated trees. In addition, imidacloprid residues in inflorescences were at much lower concentrations (on average 0.07 μg/kg) compared to those found in leaves. Tree infestation by leaf miners was significantly lower in injected trees (0.035 mines/cm2) than in control trees (0.091 mines/cm2). Our research thus indicates for the first time that, once applied, imidacloprid may affect the target and non-target species for a long time owing to its persistence in plant tissues. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology 2024.

ABSTRACT: Equine Gastric Ulcers Syndrome (EGUS) is a worldwide disease present in equids of different breeds, activity levels, and age groups. It is divided into two different illnesses: Equine Squamous Gastric Disease (ESGD) affecting the squamous mucosa and Equine Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD) affecting the glandular mucosa. The historical horserace is a traditional competition that is common in Italy. They can be divided into two different types: speed races and jousting tournaments. Anglo-Arabians and Thoroughbreds are used for the two competitions with training and management systems similar to those used in races performed on a racetrack. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ESGD and EGGD in horses used for historical horseracing and evaluate the differences in the presence of the diseases in animals of the two different breeds used for the two types of competition. A cohort of 73 horses was enrolled in this study, which were stabled in 10 training facilities and performed two jousting tournaments and one speed race. An ESGD at least of grade 2 was found in 88% of horses with all degrees of severity seen; EGGD was diagnosed in 45% of animals. In this cohort of horses, the presence and severity of ESGD and EGGD are similar to that in reports in racehorses performing on racetracks. Anglo-Arabians used for speed races are more affected by ESGD and EGGD, which is probably because they are involved in a higher number of races and travel more during the year compared to Thoroughbreds used for jousting competitions. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study evaluates a new multiport device with single access to the abdominal cavity produced with routine hospital supplies that could be applied to laparoscopically assisted cryptorchidectomy in standing horses. Initially, the new device was evaluated on five cadavers of bovine fetuses (n = 5), placed assisted in a minilaparotomy performed in the flank region. Subsequently, the device was evaluated in four cryptorchid horses treated during the hospital routine. During the evaluation of the new device, the possibilities of exploring the abdominal cavity, inspection, and intra-abdominal manipulation with two Babcock forceps were verified. The possibilities were described, and surgical time data were recorded and analyzed using descriptive statistics. In the cadavers, a wide exploration of the abdominal cavity was possible, with a laparoscopic inspection through the right paralumbar fossa and manipulation of intra-abdominal structures with Babcock forceps inserted by the new device. In cryptorchid horses, laparoscopically assisted cryptorchidectomy with a new device was feasible in two patients, and in the others, it allowed the diagnosis of adhesions and ectopic locations in the inguinal region of testicles retained in the cavity. Therefore, the new device was efficient in exploring the inguinal region of cryptorchid horses in the standing position. The present study is preliminary and can support future studies that aim to improve the developed prototype. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Combat training of police horses, involving physical activity in the presence of environmental stressors, poses a risk of oxidative stress. This study compared the oxidative imbalance after combat training in horses in the regular police service and in horses that had just been schooled. Blood collection was performed immediately after training and after 16 h rest. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant status (TAS) were determined as the markers of enzymatic antioxidant defence. At the same time, lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonylation (Carb) were assessed as oxidation biomarkers. Additionally, oxidative imbalance indexes such as SOD/CAT, SOD/GPx, TBARS/TAS and TBARS/GPx were calculated. Animals during schooling had significantly lower SOD activity in erythrocytes than those experienced. CAT activity in erythrocytes was insignificantly higher immediately after training than during recovery. The SOD/GPx ratio was higher in experienced animals, which may reflect the intra-erythrocyte imbalance between enzymes producing and degrading hydrogen peroxide towards the first one. The concentration of carbonyl groups was significantly higher after the combat training compared to the recovery period in all horses. In inexperienced animals slight increase in TBARS/TAS and TBARS/GPx indexes were observed during the recovery time after exercises, contrary to experienced horses, in which these markers decreased slightly. These results suggest that the oxidative imbalance in inexperienced horses, although less pronounced just after combat training, was more prolonged as compared to horses in regular service. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Uncontrolled crossbreeding is a major challenge to the conservation of landrace horses in East Asia. Understanding the factors driving this trend is crucial for effective conservation efforts. Here, we investigate the genomic makeup of 40 Mongolian Naadam racehorses and 21 Asian landrace horse breeds through analyzing whole-genome resequencing and Y chromosome data. Our results show that crossbreeding practices are linked to horse-racing traditions. Regions characterized by strong horse-racing traditions and a lack of crossbreeding regulations exhibit significant levels of exotic genetic introgression, as observed in populations from Inner Mongolia and Central Asia. However, in Mongolia, despite having strong horse-racing traditions, the implementation of policies aimed at preserving traditional horse-racing culture effectively reduces exotic introgression. These results suggest that horse-racing traditions are the main driver of crossbreeding practices. Our research highlights that the preservation of traditional values in landrace horses, achieved through carefully managed horse-racing activities, can lead to successful conservation outcomes. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Dystocia typically presents a life-threatening condition for both the mare and the foal. This prospective long-term study aimed to ascertain whether mares with prior pregnancy disorders or a history of dystocia were at a higher risk of experiencing subsequent dystocia in comparison to those without such medical antecedents. To achieve this goal, the authors analysed 207 parturitions and 164 mares over a 10-year period. Of these, 57 were associated with pregnancy disorders or prior dystocia (Group 1), while 150 parturitions followed uneventful pregnancies in mares that had not yet experienced dystocia (Group 2). Mares in Group 1 were significantly more likely to develop dystocia than those in Group 2 (p =.0180; odds ratio = 2.98). Foetal causes of dystocia were more prevalent than maternal causes (p <.0389). Maternal mortality stood at 0.5%, and neonatal mortality reached 1.9%. The results demonstrate that mares are at significantly higher risk of developing dystocia after experiencing pregnancy disorders or parturition complications during previous pregnancies, emphasizing the need for systematic birth monitoring. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial prescriptions of the University of Pisa and their compliance with prudent use recommendations were investigated over 11 years (2011−2021). At least one antimicrobial was always prescribed in surgical prophylaxis for the suture of wounds and in 33% of horses with signs of disease of a body system. Antimicrobials were administered in monotherapy (48%) in fixed dose combinations (21%) and empirical combinations (31%). Antimicrobials were mostly (63%) administered by parenteral route, while oral and topical antimicrobials accounted for 14% and 23% of prescriptions, respectively. Gentamicin, benzylpenicillin and ceftiofur were the most prescribed antimicrobials; aminoglycosides, penicillins and cephalosporins were the most common class of antimicrobial prescribed. Protected antimicrobials (WHO HPCIA and rifampicin) represented 24% of antimicrobial dispensations. The pattern of classes of antimicrobial used by body system was broad and included up to eight different pharmaceutical classes. The heterogeneity of antimicrobial use was confirmed by the estimate of the prescription diversity index. Antimicrobial prescriptions were in compliance with prudent use recommendations in terms of availability of diagnosis, respect of the dose range and duration of treatment On the contrary, principles of appropriate antimicrobial use have only been partially observed in relation to off-label use, use of antimicrobials in empirical combination, use of antimicrobial susceptibility tests and use of protected antimicrobials, suggesting that additional interventions are required to improve the responsible use of antimicrobials use in our equine practice. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The African horse sickness virus (AHSV) belongs to the Genus Orbivirus, family Sedoreoviridae, and nine serotypes of the virus have been described to date. The AHSV genome is composed of ten linear segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA, numbered in decreasing size order (Seg-1 to Seg-10). Genome segment 2 (Seg-2) encodes outer-capsid protein VP2, the most variable AHSV protein and the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. Consequently, Seg-2 determines the identity of the virus serotype. An African horse sickness (AHS) outbreak in an AHS-free status country requires identifying the serotype as soon as possible to implement a serotype-specific vaccination program. Considering that nowadays ‘polyvalent live attenuated’ is the only commercially available vaccination strategy to control the disease, field and vaccine strains of different serotypes could co-circulate. Additionally, in AHS-endemic countries, more than one serotype is often circulating at the same time. Therefore, a strategy to rapidly determine the virus serotype in an AHS-positive sample is strongly recommended in both epidemiological situations. The main objective of this study is to describe the development and validation of three triplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for rapid AHSV serotype detection. Samples from recent AHS outbreaks in Kenia (2015–2017), Thailand (2020), and Nigeria (2023), and from the AHS outbreak in Spain (1987–1990), were included in the study for the validation of these methods. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: To date, the suitability of affiliative behaviours for inclusion in a horse welfare assessment protocol has not been thoroughly studied. This is surprising, given the growing focus on demonstrating the presence of positive welfare rather than just the absence of poor welfare. This shift is driven by the recognition that simply avoiding negative experiences does not necessarily equate to a positive welfare state, and that there is more to good welfare than just the absence of disease, injury or stress. Thus, we critically reviewed the current scientific literature to propose quantitatively assessed animal-based indicators that indicate positive welfare and could therefore be incorporated in a welfare assessment protocol for horses. Amongst the candidate indicators that have previously been associated with positive welfare in horses are socio-positive interactions between horses, such as affiliative activities consisting of social proximity, social play and social grooming. These activities must meet the scientific quality criteria regarding validity, reliability and feasibility to enable an objective assessment of positive animal welfare. However, the current review showed that social play and social grooming amongst adult horses under husbandry conditions are not sufficiently valid indicators. These two affiliative behaviours would meet the requirement for validity only in combination with a differential diagnosis considering the absence of, for example, the stress caused by space restriction. Furthermore, social play and social grooming amongst adult horses may not fulfil the requirement for feasibility, because these behaviours occur rarely and unpredictably throughout the day, hindering their assessment within a limited observation time. As a result of this literature review, we suggest that social proximity may be the only suitable affiliative behaviour indicating positive welfare in adult horses. It best reflects the social bond with preferred partners - a key element for experiencing positive welfare. This affiliative behaviour has been investigated thoroughly in various sport and leisure horse housing systems regarding all three scientific quality criteria. It satisfies the validity criterion because to be counted as a socio-positive interaction, social proximity must be achieved voluntarily whereby the term ‘voluntary social proximity’ may best fit this requirement. Notably, it also fulfils the reliability and feasibility criteria in terms of good inter-observer agreement given a standardised assessment method including parameters such as distance between horses, duration and context. Thus, social proximity seems to be a promising indicator of positive welfare in horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The industrial component that transfers heat from one fluid to another most frequently uses Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers (STHE). Enhancing the heat transfer efficiency of heat exchangers has garnered more attention as a result of scarce energy resources and high energy expenditures. In STHE, the pressure drop is considered an important issue that causes cracks and economic losses. An essential factor in improving the performance of a heat exchanger with low pressure drop was the angle and distance of the baffles. Several methods were developed to reduce pressure drop and speed up heat transfer. But those methods were not provide a satisfactory pressure drop reduction, so the optimal baffle configuration was still a task in the heat exchanger. In the proposed model, Horse-herd Optimization Algorithm (HOA) based baffle design and neural network based thermal performance prediction arrangement was developed to reduce the pressure drop and predict the rate of transferring heat. Shells and tubes were developed at the corresponding material, inside the shell, a baffle was designed to barrier the flow of cold water. The optimal solution of baffle configuration was solved through HOA, which finds the appropriate baffle’s distance and angle by reducing the pressure drop. After the water flow modelling, the seven key parameters values were observed, and create a dataset. Using this data, a thermal performance prediction system was developed to analyze each period input value to predict the net energy, heat transfer rate, and Nussle number. The proposed model provides 52 Pa pressure drop, 0.59 effectiveness, 0.59 NTU, 417 U, and 92% accuracy. The output of the suggested approach is contrasted with that of other current methods for validation. The proposed model offers a high heat transferring capacity and reduces pressure effects risk. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection is a non-invasive sampling method that provides valuable information regarding the health status of the respiratory system by measuring inflammatory mediators, such as pH, hydrogen peroxide, and leukotriene B4. This scoping review aimed to provide an update on the collection and analysis of EBC in horses. A systematic search of three electronic databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, identified 40,978 articles, of which 1590 duplicates were excluded. Moreover, 39,388 articles were excluded because of irrelevance to this review, such as studies on other species, studies on respiratory exhalation, reviews, and theses. Finally, we evaluated 14 articles in this review. Our review revealed significant differences in the collection, storage, and processing of EBC samples, emphasizing the need for standardizing the technique and using specific equipment to improve the interpretation of the results. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Cooling down is essential for horse recovery before veterinary inspection during an endurance ride. As salt potentially decreases water temperature, we tested whether adding salt to the water used to cool horses could aid their recovery. Twelve healthy Arabian horses participating in a novice endurance ride were divided evenly into two groups. Heart rate variability (HRV) variables, including time and frequency domains, non-linear results, and autonomic nervous system indices, were determined before recovery and at 1-min intervals for 9 min during recovery using either cold or cold-saline water. An interaction between water type and time was observed in the modulation of the SD of beat-to-beat (RR) intervals, square root of the mean squared differences between successive RR intervals (RMSSD), HRV triangular index, very low-frequency band (VLF), low-frequency band/high-frequency band ratio, and SD of the Poincaré plot perpendicular to the line of identity (SD1) non-linear results. A decrease in heart rate and the sympathetic nervous system index corresponding to an increase in RR intervals and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) index was observed over time. A rise in the triangular interpolation of the normal-to-normal intervals, number of successive RR interval pairs that differ more than 50 ms, low-frequency band, and total power, coinciding with decreased stress index, was detected at 9 min of recovery. A difference between RMSSD and SD1 was observed between groups, in which they were higher in horses cooling with cold-saline water when compared to cold water at 5 min after cooling began. An increase in VLF was seen at 9 min only in horses cooled with cold-saline water. In conclusion, different water types distinctly impacted HRV in horses. The predominant PNS activity in horses recovering with cold-saline water reflects its positive impact on cooling during an endurance ride. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Accurate determination of coat colours in Bosnian Mountain Horse (BMH) can be challenging as there are variations in coat colour shades and several dun dilution variants occur. In other studies found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within two colour loci T-box 3 (TBX3) and 11-bp indel polymorphism within Agouti Signalling Protein gene (ASIP), were genotyped in 313 BMH individuals. The obtained genotypes were then compared to the identified phenotypes by using the observed coat colour types from the International Association of Bosnian Mountain Horse Breeders (IABMHB) database. It was found that the dark bay and black were the most representative coat colours in BMH. The frequency of the dominant Dun (D) dilution allele in the study is higher (0.09) than the previously predicted frequency recorded in the available BMH register. Among the identified alleles, there was a discrepancy or inconsistency between the predicted coat colour based on genotypes and the observed coat colour in 73 horses (23%). The most frequent error concerned the misclassification of horses with genotypes aa and Aa at the ASIP gene, non-dun1/non-dun1 (nd1/nd1) and non-dun2/non-dun1 (nd1/nd2) at the TBX3 gene, which can be associated with the occurrence of slight dilution phenotypes in these individuals. In contrast to the Konik and Hucul breeds, no homozygosity of the D allele was found in the BMH. The D allele can be easily overlooked or not recognised in different phenotypic groups, such as dark bay and black horses. Therefore, the hypothesis that Dun dilution effects itself is not as strongly epistatic in the BMH as described in other horse breeds. The results of the study confirm the importance of molecular testing in accurately determining the coat colour of horses. This would help to avoid errors in coat colour descriptions in official breeding records and provide valuable information for selective breeding programmes aimed at producing specific and desired coat colours. © 2024 University of Ljubljana Press.

ABSTRACT: Horse transport is considered a cause of stress in animals and is known to affect the 5-HT concentrations in both the brain and other tissues. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of horse transportation and slaughter stress on plasma serotonin’s concentration and the expression levels of the related 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors in PBMCs. Furthermore, the IL-12 levels and a variety of blood parameters, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, were also considered. This research was carried out on 32 horses submitted to short road transport of 40 km to slaughter. Blood samples were collected in baseline conditions (T0) and 24 h later, after they were slaughtered (T1). The results showed a significantly increased expression of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors and a significantly decreased expression of IL-12 in PBMCs at T1 vs. T0. Furthermore, a significant increase in cortisol and glucose concentrations, and LDH activity was observed at T1. In contrast, a significantly lower circulating 5-HT concentration was observed at T1 vs. T0. These results indicate that the stress induced by transport and slaughter stimuli led to the serotoninergic system’s activation, suggesting that the expression of serotonin receptors could be used as a pivotal marker of stress, with potential applications for the improvement of elective protocols to observe the guidelines relating to transported horses. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Similar to gut bacterial community, gut fungal community are also an important part of the gut microbiota and play crucial roles in host immune regulation and metabolism. However, most studies have focused on the gut bacterial community, and research on the gut fungal community has been limited. Dutch Warmblood (DWH) and Mongolian horses (MGH) are important equine breeds, but little research has been done on their gut fungal community. Here, we assessed differences in gut fungal community between two horse species. Results showed that a total of 2159 OTUs were found in the Dutch Warmblood and Mongolian horses, of which 308 were common. Between-group analyzes of microbial diversity showed no differences in the alpha and beta diversity of gut fungal community between the two horse species. Microbiological taxonomic surveys showed that the dominant fungal phyla (Neocallimastigomycota and Ascomycota) and genera (unclassified_Neocallimastigaceae and Anaeromyces) were the same without being affected by species. Although the types of dominant fungal phyla did not change, the abundances of some fungal genera changed significantly. Results of Metastats analysis showed that there were a total of 206 fungal genera that were significantly different between the two horses, among which 78 genera showed an increase and 127 genera significantly decreased in Dutch Warmblood horses compared with Mongolian horses. In conclusion, this study investigated the composition and structure of the gut fungal community of Dutch Warmblood and Mongolian horses and found significant differences in gut fungal community between both breeds. Notably, this is the first exploration of the differences in the gut fungal community of both breeds, which may help to understand the distribution characteristics of the gut fungal community of different breeds of horses and reveal the differences in the traits of different horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Objective: To compare plasma l-lactate (LAC) values between samples collected from jugular and cephalic venipuncture in healthy horses and systemically ill horses. Design: Prospective, experimental study. Setting: Large animal university teaching hospital. Animals: Thirty healthy adult university-owned horses and 43 client-owned horses presenting to the large animal hospital for elective surgical procedures or for emergent medical evaluation of systemic illness. Interventions: Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein (JV) and cephalic vein (CV) and placed in EDTA blood tubes prior to any medical therapy. LAC values were obtained with a handheld lactate meter at the time of blood collection. Measurements and Main Results: LAC was higher in CV samples than JV samples in healthy horses (P < 0.001); however, all values were within the normal reference range. Similarly, LAC was higher in CV samples than JV samples in systemically ill horses (P < 0.001), but the median JV value was within normal reference range (1.9 mmol/L [17.1 mg/dL]), while the median CV value was outside the normal reference range (2.9 mmol/L [26.1 mg/dL]). Conclusions: The CV is an alternative venipuncture site for assessing plasma LAC if the JV is not accessible or to preserve the JV for subsequent catheterization. However, in ill horses, the CV value may be outside the reference range when the corresponding JV value would have been within the reference range. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2024.

ABSTRACT: Replicability is a fundamental tenet of the scientific method and scientific reporting, but there is a preponderance to publish scientific research in English to increase international recognition, regardless of the country of origin of the research. Questionnaires are widely used to assess personality in animals. These psychometric instruments are mainly published in English but can be used all over the world in other languages. However, without safeguards relating to the translation process, the replicability of the quality of the instrument may change from its originally reported value. This study focuses on the particular issue of cross-cultural reliability of psychometric instruments used for assessing animals that have been translated from their original context. We examined the replicability of the structure of a personality scale originally used in Japanese (but reported in the English literature) on an English population (n=100), and then the reliability of the structure of a French translation of the English version with additional translational safeguards (e.g. back-translation and sense checking) on a French population (n = 159 horses). Horses were rated by 3 evaluators to also allow calculation of inter-rater reliability. We found that there was greater reliability and similarity of structure between the adapted English translation and French version of the Japanese scale, than with the originally published structure of the instrument used in Japan. These results highlight the importance of never assuming the reliability and thus validity of semantic instruments used to assess animal behaviour which have been published in a different language to that in which they were originally developed. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Horses are often still exposed to stressful or inadequate conditions and difficult relationships with humans, despite growing concerns about animal welfare. In the present study, we investigated the impact of different approaches of short-term handling sessions on young Lusitanian horses raised on a high-breed farm, specifically on their later adaptability to humans and stressful environments. Thirty-one foals (3 months old ± 15 days), from both sexes, were separated into three groups, one submitted to 3 consecutive days of handling sessions (Int-H), another to one handling session each month for 3 months (Month-H), and one left undisturbed (control). At 8 months old ± 15 days, all foals were evaluated during behavioral tests (restraint in a stock and forced-person test). Evaluations were based on behavioral observations and physiological assessments. The handled foals (Int-H and Month-H) reacted less to being isolated and restrained and better tolerated human contact and veterinary procedures than the control ones. The handled foals displayed less evasive and negative behaviors toward human approach, but also sought less human contact and did not interact, regardless of the handling timeframe. All animals displayed signs of stress when restrained in the stock, with increased neutrophil counts and CHCM levels in the blood, and no differences in metabolic (CK and LDH) and other hematological parameters. The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in handled foals than in control ones, suggesting low standards of welfare. Our data suggest that early forced handling decreases fearfulness in new environments; however, it does not improve the horses’ relationship with humans, and it decreases welfare. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess the effects of an α2-adrenoceptor agonist (detomidine) constant rate infusion (CRI) with and without an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist (vatinoxan) CRI on blood insulin and glucose concentrations, heart rate, intestinal borborygmi, and sedation during and after infusion in horses. Study design: Randomized, blinded, crossover, experimental study. Animals: A total of nine healthy, adult Finnhorse mares. Methods: Horses were treated with an intravenous (IV) detomidine loading dose (0.01 mg kg–1), followed by CRI (0.015 mg kg–1 hour–1), and the same doses of detomidine combined with an IV vatinoxan loading dose (0.15 mg kg–1), followed by CRI (detomidine and vatinoxan; 0.05 mg kg–1 hour–1) with an 18 day washout period. Infusion time was 60 minutes and horses were monitored for 240 minutes after the infusion. Heart rate, borborygmi score and sedation were assessed, and blood glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations were measured. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANCOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Insulin concentration decreased during (median nadir 1.7, range 0.0–2.9 μIU mL–1 at 60 minutes, p < 0.0001) and increased after detomidine CRI (median 36.6, range 11.7–78.4 μIU mL–1 at 180 minutes, p = 0.0001) significantly compared with detomidine and vatinoxan CRI. A significant elevation of blood glucose (peak 11.5 ± 1.6 mmol L–1 at 60 minutes, p < 0.0001) was detected during detomidine CRI. Vatinoxan alleviated the insulin changes and abolished the significant increase in blood glucose. Vatinoxan alleviated the decrease in heart rate (p = 0.0001) during detomidine infusion. No significant differences were detected in sedation scores between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Vatinoxan attenuated the negative adverse effects of detomidine CRI and thus is potentially beneficial when used in combination with an α2-adrenoceptor agonist CRI in horses. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Clinical and histologic examination of a 12-y-old client-owned Quarter Horse gelding with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction revealed dermatitis, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus nidulans, confirmed by a PCR assay. This novel presentation of a fungal disease in a horse was characterized by aggressive local invasion and failure to respond to all medical therapy attempted over a 1-y period. Treatments included systemic and topical antifungals, anti-inflammatories, and use of cellular matrices. Surgical excision was not attempted but should be strongly considered early in the disease process in similar cases if clean margins can be achieved. Postmortem findings were of locally aggressive disease with no dissemination. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Resistance of horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum ‘Mertelík’ to Cameraria ohridella was proven in the trial under semi-field conditions. Seedlings of vulnerable and resistant trees were grown together in rearing cages and were exposed to the strong attack from C. ohridella larvae. Significant differences in leaflet injuries were observed between susceptible and insect-resistant trees. Variety ‘Mertelík’ showed almost none or very small damages compared to high defoliation level in case of standard trees. The results confirmed that this resistant clone could be suitable for use under field conditions. © 2023 Authors.

ABSTRACT: Microplastics (MPs) have been shown to adsorb heavy metals and serve as vehicles for their environmental transport. To date, insufficient studies have focused on enterohepatic injury in mice co-exposed to both MPs and cadmium (Cd). Here, we report that Cd adsorption increased the surface roughness and decreased the monodispersity of PS-MPs. Furthermore, exposure to both PS-MPs and Cd resulted in a more severe toxic effect compared to single exposure, with decreased body weight gain, shortened colon length, and increased colonic and hepatic inflammatory response observed. This can be attributed to an elevated accumulation of Cd resulting from increased gut permeability, coupled with the superimposed effects of oxidative stress. In addition, using 16 S sequencing and fecal microbiota transplantation, it was demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays an essential role in the synergistic toxicity induced by PS-MPs and Cd in mice. This study showed that combined exposure to MPs and Cd induced more severe intestinal and liver damage in mice compared to individual exposure, and provided a new perspective for a more systematic risk assessment process related to MPs exposure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of using the FreeStyle Libre (a continuous glucose monitoring system [CGMS]) for instantaneous continuous monitoring of interstitial glucose in adult horses and examine the applicability and accuracy of this system in horses submitted to combined glucose–insulin test (CGIT). Design: Laboratory measurements and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) readings were analyzed using a 2 × 2 factorial statistical model with repeated measures over time. This analysis assessed the effects of the test (factor 1), group (factor 2), and their interactions (test × group, test × time, and group × time). Pearson's correlation analysis was applied to blood glucose values. Mean comparisons were conducted using the t-test, and agreement between techniques was assessed via the Bland–Altman method, with a 95% confidence interval. Setting: Field study on private horse farms in association with a veterinary school. Animals: Ten healthy stallions were assigned to one of two groups based on their body condition scores (BCS). Group 1 (G1, n = 5) consisted of nonobese horses with a BCS of 5 or 6, while Group 2 (G2, n = 5) consisted of obese horses with a BCS of 7 or higher. Interventions: A CGMS sensor was attached to the dorsolateral aspect of the proximal one third of each horse's neck. Laboratory blood glucose measurements and CGMS interstitial glucose readings were compared at different time points for up to 7 days after sensor fixation. Obese horses were also submitted to CGIT on Day 4. Measurements and Main Results: A comparative analysis of glucose measurements obtained in G1 and G2 horses using the CGMS and enzymatic methods revealed significant group × time interactions (P < 0.001) and time effects (P < 0.001). No interactions were detected between group (P = 0.45), test (P = 0.62), group and test (P = 0.28), or time and test (P = 0.92). In G1 and G2, tests were significantly correlated (r = 0.84 and P = 0.00) at all time points (T0–T5). Agreement between the glucose values obtained using different methods was excellent despite a small time delay in CGMS detection of rapid changes in blood glucose. Conclusions: It was concluded that the CGMS can be used for indirect assessment of glycemic status (ie, based on interstitial glucose measurements) in nonobese and obese adult horses submitted to CGIT. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2024.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To investigate the mechanisms underlying the improved arterial oxygenation described with flow-limited expiration (FLEX) ventilation in anesthetized horses. ANIMALS 5 healthy adult research horses. METHODS Horses underwent volume-controlled ventilation for 60 minutes (VCV1), followed by 60 minutes of FLEX, and 30 minutes of VCV (VCV2). Main outcomes included the arterial partial pressure of oxygen-to-Fio2 (PF) ratio and electrical impedance tomography (EIT)-derived functional indices at the end of each phase. The EIT data were used to create regional maps of relative lung ventilation and perfusion as well as regional maps of ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios. Ventilation indices derived from EIT included the fraction of expired volume in 1 second (FEV1; %) and the time it took for the EIT signal to drop to 50% of the peak signal at end-inspiration (TClose50; seconds). Data were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS The PF ratio increased significantly with FLEX compared to both VCV1 and VCV2 (P < .01). There were no differences in the relative distribution of ventilation nor perfusion between ventilation strategies. However, when ventilation and perfusion were superimposed and V/Q ratio maps were constructed, FLEX had a homogenizing effect toward values of 1.0. The FEV1 was shorter (P < .01) and the TClose50 was longer (P < .001) in all regions during FLEX compared to both VCV1 and VCV2. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our findings suggest that FLEX ventilation in anesthetized horses enhances regional V/Q matching, likely by pro-longing expiratory aeration and reducing airway closure. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: Phenylbutazone is often prescribed to manage pain caused by hyperinsulinemia-associated laminitis, but in diabetic people nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase insulin secretion and pancreatic activity. Hypothesis/Objectives: Investigate the effect of phenylbutazone administration on insulin secretion in horses. It was hypothesized that phenylbutazone will increase insulin secretion in horses with insulin dysregulation (ID). Animals: Sixteen light breed horses, including 7 with ID. Methods: Randomized cross-over study design. Horses underwent an oral glucose test (OGT) after 9 days of treatment with phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg IV q24h) or placebo (5 mL 0.9% saline). After a 10-day washout period, horses received the alternative treatment, and a second OGT was performed. Insulin and glucose responses were compared between groups (ID or controls) and treatments using paired t test and analyses of variance with P <.05 considered significant. Results: In horses with ID, phenylbutazone treatment significantly decreased glucose concentration (P =.02), glucose area under the curve (2429 ± 501.5 vs 2847 ± 486.1 mmol/L × min, P =.02), insulin concentration (P =.03) and insulin area under the curve (17 710 ± 6676 vs 22 930 ± 8788 μIU/mL × min, P =.03) in response to an OGT. No significant effect was detected in control horses. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Phenylbutazone administration in horses with ID decreases glucose and insulin concentrations in response to an OGT warranting further investigation of a therapeutic potential of phenylbutazone in the management of hyperinsulinemia-associated laminitis beyond analgesia. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To investigate the effect of hypoxaemia, hypotension and hypercapnia, among others, on quality of recovery from general anaesthesia in horses. Study design: Retrospective, single-centre study. Animals: A sample of 1226 horses that underwent general anaesthesia between June 2017 and June 2021. Methods: Horses and ponies weighing > 200 kg, aged > 6 months, anaesthetized using a xylazine- or medetomidine-isoflurane balanced anaesthesia protocol and presenting a complete anaesthetic record were included. Data were extracted from the clinic record system and from the original anaesthesia records. Recoveries were divided into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ based on the available recovery scores. Influence of hypoxaemia [PaO2 < 60 mmHg (7.99 kPa)], hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 70 mmHg for at least 15 minutes) and hypercapnia [PaCO2 > 60 mmHg (7.99 kPa)], anaesthesia protocol, body weight, age, breed, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, type of procedure, emergency or nonemergency, duration of anaesthesia, positioning, times spent in lateral and sternal recumbency during recovery, time until standing and nonassisted or assisted recovery on the assigned recovery score (good/bad) were investigated using generalized linear regression analysis (p < 0.05). Results: Hypoxaemia and prolonged duration of anaesthesia were significantly associated with a bad recovery score. No other factors had a significant influence on recovery quality. Conclusion and clinical relevance: Hypoxaemia and prolonged anaesthesia duration have a negative effect on quality of anaesthetic recovery in horses. Clinically, this highlights the importance of keeping anaesthetic time as short as possible and to monitor oxygenation and treat hypoxaemia as soon as possible. © 2023 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: Background: During transportation many horses develop post-transportation infection, which can be life-threatening and end their sport career. Preventing mucus accumulation and inflammation during transportation is vital, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to enhance overall horse health welfare. Objectives: Assess the impact of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on mucus accumulation and inflammation in horses subjected to 18 hours of head confinement. Animals: Six healthy crossbred horses, 5.3 ± 2.1 years of age and weighing 387 ± 30 kg. Methods: Prospective placebo-controlled cross-over design study. The horses' heads were restrained in their stalls for a period of 18 hours. They were studied under 4 conditions: Not confined (NC): before head confinement, placebo (P), and confined head (CH): 18 hours of head confinement without treatment, and N-Acetylcysteine (NAC): 18 hours of head confinement treated with NAC before confinement (15 mg/kg/day NAC PO for 3 days). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in each condition. Mucus accumulation along the trachea was evaluated by endoscopy. Results: Endoscopic scores were significantly different between CH and other conditions, whereas no significant differences were found among NC, P, and NAC. The BAL cell count (34 291 ± 2624 cells/μL), neutrophil and lymphocyte count (18 601 ± 3193 cells/μL and 3337.4 ± 593 cells/μL, respectively) in CH were significantly higher compared to NAC. Neutrophil percentage was significantly higher in CH (53.8 ± 8%) compared to horses that received NAC (20.08 ± 8%). Conversely, in comparison to NAC (66.33 ± 9%), the percentage of macrophages was significantly lower in CH (35.7 ± 10%). Conclusions: N-acetylcysteine was found to significantly decrease mucus accumulation and inflammatory cell counts in horses with head confinement. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The use of specific head–neck positions (HNPs) in horse riding have been identified to directly affect wellbeing of horses. In the rulebook of the International Equestrian federation (FEI), HNPs with the nasal plane in front of the vertical are mandatory, as well as ensuring horses to be “happy athletes”. Deviations from this should be reflected in the scoring of dressage competitions. We investigated ridden elite dressage horses in warm-up areas and during competition, and hypothesised a relationship between the HNP, behavioural indicators and the scores. Forty-nine starters (83%) of an international dressage competition (Grand Prix Special (CDIO5*) at CHIO (Aachen (Germany) in 2018 and 2019) were examined. We analysed HNPs (angle at vertical, poll angle and shoulder angle) as well as conflict behaviour (CB), e.g. unusual oral behaviour (OB) and tail swishing (TS), in the warm-up area and during competition in 3 min-videos (6571 frames). Conflict behaviour was evaluated using the Observer XT with the focus animal method according to an ethogram. Scores given by judges in the competition were noted. Data were analysed with six linear mixed effects models, where phase of competition and year (both factors with two levels) were fixed effects, and the horse was a random effect. Dependent variables were poll angle, angle at vertical, shoulder angle, TS, OB and total CB. Further, we evaluated another three models to evaluate if the vertical angle affected the response variables (TS, OB or CB). Hereby, angle at the vertical (continuous) and year (factor with two levels) were fixed effects, and the horse was considered as a random effect. The horses’ nasal plane was behind the vertical more often during warm-up than during competition (−11° vs. −5°; P<.01). Further, the poll angle was larger during competition than during warm-up (28° vs. 24°; P<.01). Horses showed more total CB and OB during warm-up than during competition (count: 163 and 107 vs. 120 and 78; P<.01). Horses tended to show more CB and OB when their nasal plane was behind the vertical. Tail swishing was not affected by angle at the vertical. Scores given by the judges correlated with HNPs during competition (R = 0.38; P<.05). These results undermine animal welfare concerns during world class dressage competitions. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Pathological fractures have been reported in equids with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) but their prevalence and pathogenesis is unknown. Objectives: To compare: (1) bone mineral density (BMD) in weight bearing and nonweight bearing bones in PPID+ equids and aged and young PPID− controls; and (2) biomechanical properties of the fourth lumbar vertebral body in PPID+ equids and aged PPID− equids. Study design: Case–control study: five PPID+ equids and six aged and four young PPID− control horses. Methods: PPID status was based on clinical signs and necropsy examination of the pituitary gland (PG). The lumbar vertebral column, right front third metacarpus (MC3), left hind third metatarsus (MT3), and PG were removed after euthanasia. BMD was determined by quantitative computed tomography of regions of interest (ROI) in each bone and biomechanical testing was performed on the fourth lumbar vertebral body. Serum concentrations of parathormone (PTH), ionised Ca++, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and osteocalcin (OC) were also measured. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA and correlation analyses. Results: BMD of trabecular and cortical regions of interest (ROI) of the third, fourth (L4), and fifth lumbar vertebrae were significantly lower in PPID+ equids as compared with aged (p < 0. 001) and young (p < 0.01) PPID− controls. In contrast, no differences were found in BMD of trabecular or cortical ROIs of MC3 and MT3 between groups. No differences were detected in force at fracture, displacement at fracture, Young's modulus or strain of L4 between PPID+ and aged PPID− horses. No differences were found in serum PTH, ionised Ca++, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or OC concentrations between groups. Main limitations: Limited number of equids studied and variation in test results. Conclusions: BMD of nonweight bearing bones can be decreased with PPID and could increase risk of developing pathological fractures. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Influenza A viruses are a great threat to human health because of their heterogeneity in its host range and the propensity of reassortment to novel viruses with pandemic potential. There is risk of zoonotic transmission of influenza A between humans and livestock due to close interactions. Due to the paucity of data on influenza A viruses among domesticated animals, we investigated the presence of nucleocapsid of influenza A virus antibodies using ID screen® influenza A antibody competitive multi-species enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 184 pigs were sampled from Benue state, and 92 horses were sampled from three local government areas of Kaduna state, Nigeria. Of the animals sampled, an estimated 25% (95% CI: 18.92, 31.90) of pigs and 93.48% (95% CI: 86.34, 97.57) of horses tested positive for influenza A virus IgG. The results indicate exposure of domestic animals to influenza A virus, thereby raising concern of potential epidemics in both animals and humans. There is need for increased surveillance in both domestic animals and humans who are in close interaction. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The goal for most warmblood studbooks is to produce horses that are internationally competitive in sports like show jumping or dressage. The linear scoring system, describing the horse between two biological extremes, is commonly used for a more objective assessment of young horses in many studbooks. However, few studies have examined the phenotypic association between traits linearly scored at a young age and sport performance, and whether there might be an intermediate optimum on the linear scale. This study investigated the phenotypic association between linearly scored traits and competition performance in show jumping or dressage, using the results of linear scoring from young horse performance tests between 2013 and 2021 and competition data between 2014 and 2021 for Swedish Warmblood horses. Sport performance was defined as lifetime accumulated points achieved in show jumping or dressage competitions. Horses were classified as jumping (J) or dressage (D) horses according to their sires’ and grandsires’ classification. In total, 48 linearly scored traits, assessed on a biological scale from A to I, were analyzed. The phenotypic association between the linear score for each trait and sport performance was studied using linear models for sport performance including fixed effects of sex, birth year and linear and quadratic regression on adjusted linearly scored trait values. Significant differences in LS means between J and D horses were found for all linearly scored traits except for length of body and five traits referring to leg conformation. For J horses, 25 linearly scored traits (eight conformation traits, three gait traits, 13 jumping traits and one behavior trait) were found to be significantly associated (p < 0.05) with show jumping performance. A majority of these traits (21 out of 25 traits) showed a linear association with performance, indicating that stronger expression (towards A on the assessment scale) was favorable for performance in show jumping in J horses. For D horses, 21 linearly scored traits (eleven conformation traits and ten gait traits) were significantly associated with dressage performance. Most of these traits (15 out of 21 traits) showed a linear association with performance, while six traits showed an association with optimal scores, indicating that breeding for more extreme expression of the specific trait is not associated with better sport performance. These results underline the importance of linearly scored traits as indicator traits of later sport success. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: Eight-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of oxidative damage evaluated in human neurodegenerative disease, has potential to correlate with postmortem diagnosis of neuroaxonal dystrophy/degenerative myeloencephalopathy (NAD/DM) in horses. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that 8-OHdG will be higher in CSF and serum from NAD/DM horses compared with horses with other neurologic diseases (CVSM, EPM) and a control group of neurologically normal horses. We also hypothesized that 8-OHdG will be higher in CSF compared with serum from NAD/DM horses. Animals: Fifty client-owned horses with postmortem diagnoses: 20 NAD/DM, 10 CVSM, 10 EPM, and 10 control horses. Serum and CSF samples were obtained between November 2010 and March 2022. Methods: Case-control study using biobanked samples was performed and commercial competitive ELISA kit (Highly Sensitive 8-OHdG Check ELISA) utilized. Concentration of 8-OHdG was quantitated in both CSF and serum and compared between groups. Results: No correlation was established between the measures of 8-OHdG in serum and CSF and group. CSF median [8-OHdG] for NAD/DM was 169.9 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 67.18-210.6), CVSM 157.1 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 132.1-229.1), EPM 131.4 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 102.1-193.2), and control 149.8 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 113.3-196.4). Serum median [8-OHdG] for NAD/DM was 130 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 51.73-157.2), CVSM 125.8 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 62.8-170.8), EPM 120.6 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 87.23-229.7), and control 157.6 pg/mL (IQR25-75: 97.15-245.6). Poisson regression analysis showed no difference established once confounding variables were considered. Conclusions: Eight-OHdG did not aid in antemortem diagnosis of NAD/DM in this cohort of horses. At the time of diagnosis horses with NAD/DM do not have ongoing oxidative stress. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Diarrhea is a prevalent health issue in farm animals and poses a significant challenge to the progress of animal husbandry. Recent evidence suggested that probiotics can alleviate diarrhea by maintaining gut microbial balance and enhancing the integrity of the intestinal barrier. However, there is a scarcity of studies investigating the efficacy of equine Lactobacillus reuteri in relieving E. coli-induced diarrhea. Hence, this study aimed to examine the potential of equine-derived Lactobacillus reuteri in alleviating E. coli diarrhea from the perspective of gut microbiota. Results demonstrated that supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri had the potential to alleviate diarrhea induced by E. coli infection and restore the decline of tight junction genes, such as Claudin-1 and ZO-1. Additionally, Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation can restore the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and reduce colon inflammatory damage. Diversity analysis, based on amplicon sequencing, revealed a significant reduction in the diversity of gut microbiota during E. coli-induced diarrhea. Moreover, there were notable statistical differences in the composition and structure of gut microbiota among the different treatment groups. E. coli could induce gut microbial dysbiosis by decreasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Ligilactobacillus, Enterorhabdus, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG_001, in comparison to the control group. Conversely, supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri could restore the abundance of beneficial bacteria and increase the diversity of the gut microbiota, thereby reshaping gut microbiota. Additionally, we also observed that supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri alone improved the gut microbial composition and structure. In summary, the findings suggest that Lactobacillus reuteri can alleviate E. coli-induced diarrhea by preserving the integrity of the intestinal barrier and modulating the composition of the gut microbiota. These results not only contribute to understanding of the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus reuteri in relieving diarrhea, but also provide valuable insights for the development of probiotic products aimed at alleviating diarrheal diseases. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Horses can contribute to the maintenance of grassland. To determine the potential contribution of grassland to horse nutrition, we investigated the seasonal variation of herbage on offer and its nutritional quality in an inventory on six practical horse farms in Central Germany during 2019. On all horse-grazed pastures compressed sward height (CSH) was measured monthly and converted into aboveground herbage (AGH) to allocated short and tall grass sward areas (area-specific) via calibration cuts. In addition, four focus pastures were selected for monthly obtained area-specific herbage quality samples. The farm-specific management was monitored using questionnaires and grazing diaries to determine underlying factors influencing herbage biomass and quality. The proportion of short grass sward areas increased during the grazing season (p=0.0010), which was related to high stocking intensity in terms of livestock unit grazing days (LUGD, p <.0001). On most farms, LUGD were constant throughout the growing season and not adjusted to changing grass growth. Herbage crude protein (CP, p=0.0038), metabolizable energy (ME, p <.0001) concentrations and acid detergent fibre in the organic matter (ADF, p <.0001) differed among the grass sward areas. The results suggest that sufficient ME (4.2 ± 0.32 – 8.4 ± 0.15 MJ ME kg−1 DM) for maintenance and pre-caecal digestible CP (pcdCP) (37.0 ± 3.86 – 77.4 ± 4.44 g kg−1 DM) could be provided during the grazing season. The study highlights the need to incentivise grassland management for herbage provision among horse owners to exploit the potential of grassland during the grazing season. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Objective. Data from two-plane electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can be reconstructed into various slices of functional lung images, allowing for more complete visualisation and assessment of lung physiology in health and disease. The aim of this study was to confirm the ability of 3D EIT to visualise normal lung anatomy and physiology at rest and during increased ventilation (represented by rebreathing). Approach. Two-plane EIT data, using two electrode planes 20 cm apart, were collected in 20 standing sedate horses at baseline (resting) conditions, and during rebreathing. EIT data were reconstructed into 3D EIT whereby tidal impedance variation (TIV), ventilated area, and right-left and ventral-dorsal centres of ventilation (CoVRL and CoVVD, respectively) were calculated in cranial, middle and caudal slices of lung, from data collected using the two planes of electrodes. Main results. There was a significant interaction of time and slice for TIV (p < 0.0001) with TIV increasing during rebreathing in both caudal and middle slices. The ratio of right to left ventilated area was higher in the cranial slice, in comparison to the caudal slice (p = 0.0002). There were significant effects of time and slice on CoVVD whereby the cranial slice was more ventrally distributed than the caudal slice (p < 0.0009 for the interaction). Significance. The distribution of ventilation in the three slices corresponds with topographical anatomy of the equine lung. This study confirms that 3D EIT can accurately represent lung anatomy and changes in ventilation distribution during rebreathing in standing sedate horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Piroplasmosis is responsible for anemia, fever, loss of physical activity and even death in equines. In epidemiological studies, accurate diagnostic tests are essential for detecting asymptomatic carriers. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of infection in asymptomatic horses from Lorestan province, western Iran by developing a multiplex PCR. Methods and results: Blood samples were examined by microscopy and multiplex PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene of Theileria equi and Babesia caballi. Out of the total of 165 horses, 19 (11.51%) and 31 (18.78%) cases were positive for piroplasms by microscopy and PCR, respectively. The detection rates of both genera were significantly higher in multiplex PCR compared to microscopy (p < 0.0001). Compared with multiplex PCR, the sensitivities of microscopy for the detection of Babesia were only 28.5%. The prevalence of T. equi infection was significantly higher in summer (p = 0.035). The prevalence of B. caballi was significantly higher in males (p = 0.038). Conclusion: Findings indicate that the multiplex PCR described here is a sensitive technique for the detection of piroplasm DNA in carriers. Furthermore, asymptomatic carriers must be considered as an important source of infection for equids living in this region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Alveolar echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease caused by a larval-stage Echinococcus multilocularis infection. Geographical haplotyping targeting the parasite's mitochondrial cytochrome b (cob) gene has been reported for isolates from definitive and intermediate hosts (wild canids and rodents); however, there are limited reports on strain typing for the dead-end host, the horse, which could act as a sentinel for E. multilocularis. Accordingly, we investigated the diversity of E. multilocularis in isolates obtained from slaughtered Japanese and Canadian horses originating from the Iburi and Hidaka regions in Hokkaido and from Alberta, respectively, with PCR and haplogroup analyses targeting cob gene sequences obtained. Seventy horses were diagnosed with alveolar echinococcosis based on histopathology and cob-gene PCR testing. The E. multilocularis detected in these horses was classified as either an Asian (for Hokkaido-raised horses) or a European (for Alberta-raised horses) haplogroup, based on the obtained cob-gene sequence analysis. In addition, haplotype network analysis revealed that E. multilocularis isolated from Hokkaido-raised horses is highly homologous to Kazakhstan isolates, and E. multilocularis isolated from Alberta-raised horses is highly homologous to Austrian isolates. The results of this study suggest that cob-gene-targeted PCR analysis could be useful for the geographical genetic characterization of E. multilocularis isolated from horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This study assessed worm control practices used by Australian Thoroughbred farm managers with an online questionnaire survey. The questionnaire comprised 52 questions (close-ended: 44; open-ended: 8) about farm demography and general husbandry practices, farm managers’ knowledge of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and their importance, diagnosis, worm control strategies and anthelmintics, anthelmintic resistance (AR) and grazing management. Following the pilot survey, the link for the questionnaire survey was sent to all (n = 657) registered members of the Thoroughbred Breeders Australia on 12th April 2020. The response rate for the questionnaire was 18.5% (122 of 675). The farm managers reported a good understanding of GIN and their importance in different age groups of horses as most respondents (70% of 122) perceived worm-related illness to be more important in young (i.e., foals, weanlings and yearlings) than adult (> 3 years old) horses. Although most respondents (93%, 113 of 122) used anthelmintics prophylactically to control GIN, only 15% (18 of 122) observed worm-related illness in their horses. Just under 40% of respondents were performing faecal egg counts, with less than 20% using the results of faecal egg counts to guide deworming decisions. The interval-based deworming strategy was the most common method (≥55% of 122 respondents) to control GIN in all age groups of horses. Macrocyclic lactones were the first choice of anthelmintics for all age groups of horses. Although the majority of respondents (88%, 107 of 122) perceived resistance in GIN against commonly used anthelmintics as an important issue in managing worms in horses, only 29% assessed the efficacy of anthelmintics and 91% (111 of 122) were unaware of AR on their properties. Grazing management practices, such as manure removal, were more frequently performed on smaller paddocks (<0.20 ha: 58%) than on larger paddocks (>0.20 ha: 18%). Multiple correspondence analyses showed that the likelihood of suboptimal worm control practices on small farms (n = ≤50 horses) was greater than that of medium (n = 51–100) and large (n = >100) farms. This study provides insights into the demography of Thoroughbred farms in Australia, husbandry practices used by stud managers and their knowledge about worms, control options and AR concerns, thereby paving the way for taking any initiatives to address the problem of AR in GIN of Australian Thoroughbred horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Cryptosporidium is an intestinal protozoan that cause diarrhea in livestock all over the world and have zoonotic importance. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in horses in Egypt and evaluate the associated risk factors. A total of 420 fecal samples were collected from three governorates (Giza, Kafr ElSheikh and Qalyubia) and examined microscopically using Ziehl-Neelsen staining method. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was 29% and Kafr ElSheikh governorate had the highest rate in comparison to other areas. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in examined horses had significant association with sex, age, type of management, absence of bedding and presence of dogs. The higher prevalence rate was observed in females (32.2%), age group less than two years (43.2%), mixed (grazing and stable) horses (36.1%), animals had history of diarrhea (33%), absence of bedding (35.1%) and contact with dogs (35.7%). These findings give baseline data for further research. It is necessary to establish control strategy for Cryptosporidium spp. infection in order to lower the risk of infection in animals and human. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cyathostomins are the most prevalent parasitic nematodes of grazing horses. They are responsible for colic and diarrhea in their hosts. After several decades of exposure to synthetic anthelmintics, they have evolved to become resistant to most compounds. In addition, the drug-associated environmental side-effects question their use in the field. Alternative control strategies, like bioactive forages, are needed to face these challenges. Among these, chicory (Cichorium intybus, Puna II cultivar (cv.)) is known to convey anthelmintic compounds and may control cyathostomins in grazing horses. To challenge this hypothesis, we measured fecal egg counts and the rate of larval development in 20 naturally infected young saddle horses (2-year-old) grazing either (i) a pasture sown with chicory (n = 10) or (ii) a mesophile grassland (n = 10) at the same stocking rate (2.4 livestock unit (LU)/ha). The grazing period lasted 45 days to prevent horse reinfection. Horses in the chicory group mostly grazed chicory (89% of the bites), while those of the control group grazed mainly grasses (73%). Cyathostomins egg excretion decreased in both groups throughout the experiment. Accounting for this trajectory, the fecal egg count reduction (FECR) measured in individuals grazing chicory relative to control individuals increased from 72.9% at day 16 to 85.5% at the end of the study. In addition, larval development in feces from horses grazed on chicory was reduced by more than 60% from d31 compared to control individuals. Using a metabarcoding approach, we also evidenced a significant decrease in cyathostomin species abundance in horses grazing chicory. Chicory extract enriched in sesquiterpenes lactones was tested on two cyathostomins isolates. The estimated IC50 was high (1 and 3.4 mg/ml) and varied according to the pyrantel sensitivity status of the worm isolate. We conclude that the grazing of chicory (cv. Puna II) by horses is a promising strategy for reducing cyathostomin egg excretion and larval development that may contribute to lower the reliance on synthetic anthelmintics. The underpinning modes of action remain to be explored further. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This case report describes five horses with solitary corneal B-cell lymphoma treated with superficial keratectomy as a sole treatment and their long-term follow-up. All five cases had a presumed clinical diagnosis of immune-mediated keratitis (IMMK) which was initially responsive to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment. Between 6 and 71 months from the start of clinical disease, these cases became refractory to treatment. All five horses underwent superficial keratectomy under standing sedation and regional anaesthesia. A focal superficial keratectomy was performed in one horse to remove the affected area, and in the remaining four horses, the superficial cornea was removed in its entirety. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR testing) were performed on all five keratectomy specimens. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings indicated a florid stromal infiltrate of mitotically active, intermediate to large B-lymphocytes amidst a variable background of chronic keratitis. In three of the five cases, the lymphocytes displayed prominent epitheliotropism. PARR testing confirmed rearrangements of, specifically, IGH2, IGH3 and KDE, indicating B-cell clonal expansion consistent with B-cell lymphoma. There has been no local recurrence in any of the five horses over 24–84 months of follow-up and no clinical evidence of multicentric lymphoma. No adjunctive treatment was given post-keratectomy and all eyes have remained comfortable and off treatment. Results of this report show that standing superficial keratectomy is a viable diagnostic tool and a long-term treatment option for diffuse intermediate to large corneal B-cell lymphoma. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are increasingly used in equine cardiology to detect arrhythmias in the context of collapse, poor performance or monitoring for recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF). However to date, the ILR has never been reported to be used with a remote monitoring functionality in horses, therefore the arrhythmia is only discovered when a clinician interrogates the ILR using dedicated equipment, which might delay diagnosis and intervention. This case report describes the use of an ILR with remote monitoring functionality in a horse with recurrent AF. The remote monitoring consisted of a transmission device located in the stable allowing daily transmission of arrhythmia recordings and functioning messages to an online server, available for the clinician to evaluate without specialised equipment. The ILR detected an episode of paroxysmal AF approximately 3 months after implantation. Seven months after implantation, initiation of persistent AF was seen on an episode misclassified by the ILR as bradycardia, and the horse was retired. This report shows the feasibility and benefits of remote monitoring for ILRs in horses, but also the shortcomings of current algorithms to interpret the equine electrocardiogram. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This study addresses the refinement and revalidation of a composite pain scale that focuses on equine facial expressions and behavioural indicators as exhibitions of ophthalmic pain. This scale included only Behavioural and Facial and Ocular expression indicators and, compared to the first version of Equine Ophthalmic Pain Scale (EOPS), item descriptors and related ratings were changed. Thirteen horses with ocular diseases that required medical or surgical treatment were enroled (group P). In each animal, the refined EOPS (R-EOPS) was applied prior to any treatment (T0) and one week later (T7). The R-EOPS was applied twice, 7 days apart, to 16 healthy control horses (group C). Two 30-second videos were recorded each time to allow the retrospective analysis by eight observers. Inter-observer reliability of items was moderate or substantial (Krippendorff's alpha, Kα>0.40) while their intra-observer reliability was substantial or almost perfect for most items (Kα ≥0.61). Both inter- and intra-observer reliability of Total Score (TS) were however excellent (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC>0.75). The TS also showed good reproducibility (Kendall coefficient=0.786, ICC=0.684) and high consistency of its items (Cronbach's α=0.847). The comparison between groups as well as the sensitivity and specificity values supported the validity of the R-EOPS. In particular, for each extra point added to the TS, the risk of the horse having pain increased by more than two times (Odds Ratio=2.079, 95%CI=1.542–2.804; P<0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis identified 6 as the threshold value of R-EOPS for discriminating horses with ocular pathology (sensitivity=83%, specificity=100%). This scale may be an effective tool for reliably assessing the pain level in horses with ophthalmic diseases and potentially guiding pain management although it still requires large-scale application and external validation. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Although arthroscopy is the treatment of choice for horses with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), it is not yet known whether intra-articular therapies in the postoperative period can bring any benefit to the recovery of these animals. This study evaluated the effects of the intra-articular application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), hyaluronic acid (HA) or lactated Ringer's solution (LR) in horses with OCD undergoing arthroscopy. Eighteen male and female Brazilian Sport horses aged between 2 and 6 years were evaluated. All animals presented OCD fragments in the middle crest of the tibia. Ten days after surgery, animals were randomly distributed into three groups and received intra-articular application of PRP (n = 6), HA (n = 6), or LR (control group, n = 6). Clinical, radiographic, ultrasound and synovial fluid evaluations were performed on the day of surgery and after 10, 30 and 60 days. An increase in the thickness of the joint capsule was observed 30 days after surgery in the three groups evaluated. In the control group, there was significant improvement in the flexion test 30 and 60 days after surgery, and in the PRP group, there was worsening of this parameter in the same evaluations. In the control group, there was a reduction in the degree of synovial effusion, and in the PRP and HA groups, there was increased effusion. There was a significant increase in the number of leukocytes in the HA group. Intra-articular use of PRP or HA ten days after arthroscopy did not promote positive effects on the recovery of horses with OCD. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Hand-held glucometers and continuous glucose monitoring systems are standard tools in diagnostics and the management of several diseases in humans, and are applied more frequently in veterinary medicine. The fast and accurate measurement of the glucose concentration plays a decisive role in equine medicine, both in the care of intensive care patients and the implementation of dynamic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of endocrinological disorders. The objective of the study was to evaluate the accuracy and practicability of a point-of-care glucometer and a continuous glucose monitoring system in horses. The Accu-Chek® Guide (ACG) and FreeStyle Libre™ (FL) systems were tested on seven Icelandic horses subjected to oral glucose tests and insulin-response tests, resulting in transient and dynamic changes in blood glucose concentrations. The measurements obtained were compared with a standard colorimetric glucose assay and checked for accuracy and requirements in compliance with DIN EN ISO15197 and US Food and Drug Administration standards. Both systems tested correlated well with the reference method. The ACG had a mean absolute relative difference of 6.4% and a correlation coefficient of ρ=0.96, and was, therefore, far more accurate than the FL, with a mean absolute relative difference of 35.4% and a correlation coefficient of ρ=0.56. While the ACG complied fully with the requirements of DIN EN ISO15197 and the US Food and Drug Administration, the FL met the requirements of neither. The suitability for use in horses was shown for ACG and FL. Fast and large fluctuations in the glucose concentration could not be captured by FL, which makes this system rather unsuitable for use in dynamic diagnostic test procedures, such as insulin-response or oral glucose tests. Nevertheless, it could be a promising option for the long-term monitoring of intensive care inpatients. The ACG is a safe and fast alternative to the reference method, and could be a reliable tool for use in horses in various clinical situations. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: (1) Background: The number of horses suffering from chronic respiratory diseases, resembling human asthma, is increasing but there is still a lack of reliable and accurate methods to detect these disorders. Numerous studies have found elevated plasma concentrations of one of the myokines, namely, myostatin (MSTN), in people suffering from severe asthma. MSTN normally inhibits myoblast proliferation and differentiation through autocrine or paracrine signals. Therefore, given the pathogenesis of asthma, we hypothesize that MSTN could be a useful biomarker of equine asthma. Thus, this study aimed to compare the concentration of MSTN in the blood plasma of fully healthy and asthmatic horses. (2) Methods: A total of 61 horses were clinically examined to confirm or exclude the occurrence of equine asthma, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology performed on 49 horses. This study included three groups of horses, two of which were clinically healthy, and one of which was asthmatic. (3) Results: The mean circulatory MSTN concentration determined using the ELISA method in asthmatic horses was significantly higher than that in clinically healthy young Thoroughbred racehorses (p < 0.05), but it did not differ as compared to the group of healthy, adult leisure horses. (4) Conclusions: The obtained results did not unambiguously support our original hypothesis that MSTM may be a reliable marker for the early diagnosis of equine asthma. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the plasma MSTN concentration in equine asthma patients, and therefore further studies are needed to confirm our novel findings. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the ability to completely transect the equine accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (AL-DDFT) via an ultrasonographically-guided, percutaneous looped thread desmotomy using FiberWire suture as a cutting device. Study design: Ex-vivo study. Sample population: A total of 24 normal equine distal forelimb specimens. Methods: Under ultrasonographic guidance, a Jamshidi needle was placed between the suspensory ligament and the AL-DDFT, and between the AL-DDFT and the deep digital flexor tendon, through two stab incisions. FiberWire suture was fed through the needle and looped around the AL-DDFT. Using a sawing motion, the ligament was transected, and the suture exited through the lateral incision. Surgical sites were dissected and assessed for completeness of transection, iatrogenic injuries, and suture remnants. Descriptive statistics were reported. Results: The procedure met the successful criteria in 18/24 (75%) of the limbs. The median surgical time was 11 min (range 7–25). No suture failure or suture remnants were noted in any of the specimens. Complications included iatrogenic injury to the medial and lateral neurovascular bundles in 4/24 and 1/24 specimens, respectively. Conclusion: Complete transection of the AL-DDFT was achieved in 22/24 (92%) of the specimens; however, the neurovascular bundles were injured in 5/24 (21%) of the specimens. Clinical significance: A percutaneous looped thread desmotomy of the AL-DDFT can be studied as an alternative technique for use in equine models prior to its clinical use in patients. Additional studies are required to evaluate efficacy and safety in anesthetized or standing horses. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by Theileria equi and Babesia caballi in horses. Because of its impact on horse industry, control of this disease is crucial for endemic countries. The control of equine piroplasmosis may be influenced by the genotypic diversity of T. equi and B. caballi. Mongolia, a country with a thriving livestock industry, is endemic for T. equi and B. caballi. However, nationwide epidemiological surveys have not been conducted to determine the current status of infections and genetic diversity of these two parasite species. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate the infection rates and genotypes of T. equi and B. caballi in horses across Mongolia. Blood samples were collected from 1353 horses in 15 of Mongolia's 21 provinces, and their DNAs were analyzed with T. equi- and B. caballi-specific PCR assays. Additionally, blood smears were prepared from 251 horses, stained with Giemsa, and examined under a light microscope to identify T. equi and B. caballi. The microscopy revealed that 30 (11.9%) and 4 (1.6%) of the 251 horses were positive for T. equi and B. caballi, respectively. By contrast, PCR assays detected the T. equi and B. caballi in 1058 (78.2%) and 62 (4.6%) horses, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA sequences from 42 randomly selected T. equi-positive DNA samples detected the genotypes A and E. On the other hand, the rap-1 sequences from 19 randomly selected B. caballi-positive DNA samples occurred in clades representing the genotypes A and B1, as well as in a distinct clade closely related to the genotype A. Our findings confirm the widespread occurrence of T. equi and B. caballi infections in Mongolian horses, highlighting the need for a comprehensive control approach. © 2023

ABSTRACT: We examine the appropriations of stewardship ethics by religious anti-environmental movement organizations (RAEMOs). Based on a qualitative analysis of promotional materials, we highlight similar framing alignment processes carried out by two RAEMOs in different contexts: the US Cornwall Alliance and the Brazilian Institute Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira (IPCO). We found that, despite their different theological inspirations and target audiences, the RAEMOs use the same general master counterframing to stimulate a sense of battle in which ‘genuine stewards’ must resist anti-Christian ideologies camouflaged as environmentalism, restricting themselves to a pasteurized care for creation, symbolized by the concept of gardening. As for the framing variations, we suggest that they are driven not so much by distinct religious beliefs as by political and economic coalitions, mainly linked to the fossil fuels sector in the North American case, and agribusiness, in the Brazilian case. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2024.

ABSTRACT: Jumps racing is a form of Thoroughbred horse racing that involves hurdles and steeples and typically longer distances, and heavier weights compared with flat racing, which does not incorporate obstacles. In Australia, jumps racing is carried out only in Victoria, one of eight states and territories. The continuation of jumps racing is contentious due to the higher risk of fatalities, falls and injuries for horses, compared with flat racing. While measures have been introduced by the industry to improve the safety of riders and horses, the rates of fatalities, falls and injuries in horses participating in jumps races have not been collectively reported in Australia since the 2012 to 2014 race seasons. Although information on individual horse fatalities, falls and injuries is published by Racing Victoria in Stewards’ Reports, the data are not aggregated, and so cannot readily be used to assess trends or evaluate the efficacy of safety measures introduced by the industry. The aim of this study was to determine the fatality, fall and injury rates for horses participating in hurdle and steeplechase races in Victoria in the 2022 and 2023 Thoroughbred horse jumps racing seasons compared with horses participating in flat races at the same race meets. Data on horse fatalities, falls and injuries were extracted from the published Racing Victoria race results and Stewards’ Reports for the jumps races (n = 150) and corresponding flat races (n = 157) held at the 38 jumps race meets in Victoria in 2022 and 2023. Overall, horse fatalities, falls and injuries occurred at higher rates in jumps races compared with flat races during the study period. The rate of horse fatalities in jumps races was 3.3 per 1000 starts, with no fatalities in flat races. The rate of horse falls in hurdle races was 24 per 1000 starts and 41.6 per 1000 starts in steeplechase races, comparable with rates previously reported in the 2012 to 2014 seasons. There were no falls in flat races. Horse injuries occurred at a rate of 68.9 per 1000 starts in jumps races compared with 18.8 per 1000 starts in flat races. In hurdle and steeplechase races, veterinary clearance being required following horse injury was 5.4 times (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.8–10.2) and 7.2 times (OR 7.2, 95% CI 3.3–15.6) more likely, respectively, compared with flat races. The risk of trauma was 4 times more likely in hurdle and steeplechase races (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.7–13.3 and OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.2–13.4, respectively) and the risk of lameness was increased by 2.5 times in hurdles (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.2) and 5.1 times in steeplechase races (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3–11.5), compared with flat races. These findings support concerns about the welfare of horses involved in jumps racing and of the need for further safety measures to reduce these risks. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the most appropriate sedation protocol for a standing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination in horses, comparing continuous rate infusions (CRIs) of detomidine and romifidine combined with a single bolus of morphine. Sixteen horses referred for standing low-field open-magnet MRI were randomly assigned to one of two sedation protocols. The horses were premedicated with 0.03 mg/kg of intramuscular acepromazine, and those animals belonging to Group D received an intravenous (IV) loading dose of detomidine (0.01 mg/kg) 30 min later, while those of Group R received romifidine (0.04 mg/kg). If the horses were inadequately sedated, an additional dose of IV detomidine (0.005 mg/kg) or romifidine (0.02 mg/kg) was administered, according to the animal’s group. During the MRI, a single IV bolus of morphine (0.05 mg/kg) was administered, and according to which group it belonged to, the animal started the administration of detomidine (0.01 mg/kg/h) or romifidine (0.02 mg/kg/h). Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), depth of sedation, and degree of ataxia were evaluated every 10 min during MRI. Two horses belonging to Group D and four horses from Group R needed additional sedation before entering the MRI unit because they were unsatisfactorily sedated. No side effects were observed following morphine bolus administration. During the MRI procedure, five horses in Group R received an additional IV romifidine bolus (0.01 mg/kg) because the depth of sedation score was 1 and the ataxia score was 0. Any substantial differences were recorded between the two treatments in terms of HR, RR, and RT. In conclusion, at the doses used, a detomidine–morphine combination following a CRI of detomidine appears more suitable than a romifidine–morphine combination following a CRI of romifidine for maintaining an adequate depth of sedation and adequate immobility in horses undergoing standing MRI. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the usability single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for parentage testing of horse breeds in Korea. Methods: The genotypes of 93 horse samples (38 Thoroughbred horses, 17 Jeju horses, 20 Quarter horses, and 18 American miniature horses) were determined using 15 microsatellite (Ms) markers (AHT4, AHT5, ASB2, ASB17, ASB23, CA425, HMS1, HMS2, HMS3, HMS6, HMS7, HTG4, HTG10, LEX3, and VHL20) and 101 SNP markers. Results: Paternity tests were performed using 15 Ms markers and 101 SNP markers in Thoroughbred horses and Quarter horses. AHT5, ASB2, ASB17, ASB23, CA425, HMS7, HTG10, and LEX3 did not follow Mendelian inheritance in Thoroughbred horses, whereas in Quarter horses, only AHT4, ASB2, and HMS2 showed Mendelian inheritance, consequently, paternity was not established. Meanwhile, 31 markers, including MNEc_2_2_ 2_98568918_BIEC2_502451, in Thoroughbred horses, and 30 markers, including MNEc_ 2_30_7430735_BIEC2_816793, in Quarter horses did not conform with Mendelian inheritance and therefore, could not be used for establishing parentage. Conclusion: The possibility of replacing Ms markers with SNP markers for paternity testing in horses was confirmed. However, further research using more samples is necessary.

ABSTRACT: The members of the Chlamydiaceae family are important pathogens that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. Among them, Chlamydia psittaci, historically considered as an avian agent, has recently been identified in livestock, primarily sheep and cattle, but also in horses, with the infection being linked to reproductive disorders, such as abortion, absorption of embryos, stillbirth, and the birth of weak foals. Much less is known about chlamydial infections in the Sardinian equine population. This study aimed to identify the chlamydial diversity in genital samples from asymptomatic Sardinian horses. However, some horses had a previous history of reproductive disorders, i.e., abortion and infertility. A total of 60 horses (39 mares and 21 stallions) were opportunistically recruited from 17 equine farms in central-northern Sardinia. Vaginal and uterine swabs from mares and urethral swabs and seminal fluid from stallions were sampled for the presence of chlamydial DNA. Samples from environments where the horses lived were also tested for the detection of Chlamydia spp. Eight vaginal swabs (8/39; 20%), two uterine swabs (2/27; 7%), two seminal fluid samples (2/20; 10%), and one urethral swab (1/21; 4.7%) were found to be positive for Chlamydia spp. by PCR analysis. In addition, results from environmental samples showed the presence of Chlamydia spp. in three environmental swabs (3/8; 37.5%) and five water samples (5/16; 31.2%). Sequencing results revealed that strains here identified were 99–100% similar to members belonging to the Chlamydiaceae family, including C. abortus, C. psittaci, and uncultured Chlamydia genotypes. ompA species-specific PCR performed on samples was found to be positive after 16S rRNA amplification gave positive results for C. psittaci. These results reveal the first presence of C. psittaci in the genital tract of horses and in the environment in Sardinia and indicate that this pathogen could be the prevailing cause of infertility and abortion in the tested equines. However, these findings need further proof and highlight the importance of adopting a ‘One Health’ approach to control the presence of this zoonotic bacteria in domestic animals in order to understand its impact on people exposed to the infection risk. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A 19-year-old Rocky Mountain Horse gelding was presented for emergency evaluation of colic. A pedunculated lipoma was found to be strangulating the caecum and ileocaecal junction at surgery. Following the resolution of the incarceration, it was found that the pedicle originated on the jejunal mesentery, but the stalk did not appear long enough to have formed a half-hitch around both the caecum and ileum. The horse was euthanised due to complete caecal devitalisation. A second pedunculated lipoma was identified at necropsy, located on the transverse colon with an area of ischaemia on the mesenteric pedicle (the abnormal stalk of tissue connecting the lipoma to the colonic mesentery), consistent with pressure from being entwined with the jejunal mesenteric pedicle. This report is the first to describe caecal and ileal incarceration and strangulation by a pedunculated lipoma in a horse. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A total of 500 fecal samples were collected from Equus animals in six different cities (Ardabil, Namin, Nir, Meshginshahr, Germi, and Khalkhal) of Ardabil Province, northwestern Iran, with 200 samples from horses, 200 from donkeys, and 100 from mules. Of the horse samples, 100 were from racing horses under special monitoring and care, while the remaining 100 were from non-racing horses, including those used for herding or in rural areas. All fecal samples were examined for the presence of Blastocystis sp. using PCR amplification of the SSU rRNA gene's barcode region after DNA extraction. The molecular prevalence of Blastocystis infection in Equus animals was 7.6% (38/500). Blastocystis was more common in horses [11.5% (23/200)] than in donkeys [5.5% (11/200)] and mules [4% (4/100)] (P > 0.05). Compared to racing horses [3% (3/100)], non-racing/rural horses [20% (20/100)] exhibited a substantially higher prevalence of Blastocystis (P < 0.05). The prevalence of Blastocystis in diarrheal samples and younger animals was remarkably higher than in formed samples and older animals, respectively (P < 0.05). No significant difference in Blastocystis infection prevalence was found between the genders of examined animals (P > 0.05). In Equus animals, 38 Blastocystis isolates included eight STs: ST10 [31.6% (12/38)], ST1 [21.1% (8/38)], ST2 [15.8% (6/38)], ST3 [10.5% (4/38)], ST4 [7.9% (3/38)], ST7 [5.2% (2/38)], ST14 [5.2% (2/38)], and ST6 [2.6% (1/38)]. These results suggest that Equus animals act as a proper reservoir for numerous Blastocystis STs, consequently playing a crucial part in the spread of this protozoan infection to humans, animals, and water reservoirs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The surface electrocardiogram is the gold standard tool for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias in horses. However, an electrocardiographic exam needs an electrocardiographic machine, cables and electrodes. Therefore, this diagnostic tool is not always available or practical in the field. Some handheld electrocardiographic devices that can transmit digitalised data have been reported in human and veterinary medicine in the last few years. The Ekuore ECG device, a novel smartphone tool, has recently shown an excellent agreement with standard base-apex electrocardiography in healthy horses. It obtained a standard electrocardiogram using traditional base-apex configuration when compared to previous smartphone devices. The aim of this case series is to report our clinical experience with the Ekuore device for heart rhythm analysis in horses referred for a cardiovascular examination. A total of 70 horses were evaluated for heart rhythm analysis using the Ekuore device. The single-lead bipolar Ekuore device allowed the diagnoses of physiological and pathological cardiac arrhythmias in all horses. One horse with atrial fibrillation was monitored by the referring veterinarian with the same device at home. In conclusion, we provide a first report on the use of the Ekuore device in clinical practice to evaluate heart rhythm in horses. The new smartphone electrocardiographic device can be more easily available in the field and might help clinicians to evaluate cardiac arrhythmias in horses. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: In natural conditions, horses (Equus caballus) are social animals that live in stable groups. However, horses are often housed in individual stalls from the moment they begin their initial training, also called breaking-in. Individual stabling induces social isolation and confinement, and is a source of particularly stressful events for the young horse alongside the breaking-in process. These experiences can lead to behavioural disorders in individual stalls and dangerous defensive behaviours in human-horse interactions. This study aimed to evaluate how the maintenance of social contacts impacts the behaviour of young horses during breaking-in. The comparison involved 12 young horses all housed in individual stalls for one month: six individuals had the opportunity to interact socially in pairs for two hours a day (hereafter called “Social Condition”) in a “social box”, and six individuals had no access to a social partner (hereafter called “Isolated Condition”). We collected data for various behavioural variables during training sessions (body tension, conflict behaviours, cooperation and ear positions used as an indicator of the emotional state) and activities in the individual stalls. We found that horses in the Social Condition expressed fewer abnormal behaviours (p<0.001) and stayed still more often (p<0.01) in the individual stall compared to horses in the Isolated Condition. During training, we did not find any difference in ear positions (p=0.068) and cooperation (p=0.766) between the two groups of horses. However, horses in the Social Condition adopted a more relaxed attitude (p<0.01) than those that were isolated. Although more stress-related behaviours like defecation (p<0.001) and a tense attitude were observed in isolated horses (p<0.001), these horses reacted less to the discomfort associated with training by head-tossing behaviour (p=0.026) and tail switching (p=0.033) than horses in the Social Condition. The latter would remain capable of reacting during the sessions. Our results indicate a possible beneficial impact of this socially enriched context on the first training experience of horses in the Social Condition. Finally, the device we used will promote the welfare of horses in equestrian facilities and will be in line with changes in society regarding respect for our domestic companions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Obesity is an important health concern in horses, along with humans and companion animals. Adipose tissue is an inflammatory organ that alters the insulin-signaling cascade, ultimately causing insulin dysregulation and impaired glucose metabolism. These disruptions can increase the risk of metabolic disease and laminitis in horses and may also impact energy metabolism during exercise. A single bout of exercise, along with chronic exercise conditioning, increases insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal via both contraction- and insulin-mediated glucose uptake pathways. Regular exercise also increases calorie expenditure, which can facilitate weight (as body fat) loss. This paper explores the metabolic pathways affected by adiposity, as well as discusses the impact of exercise on insulin metabolism in horses. © 2024 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Background: Delays between blood collection and analysis are inevitable, and samples are always stored in the refrigerator. The current study aimed to evaluate the stability of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), total protein (TP), albumin and urea (URA) in horses and oxen after storage at −20°C. Methods: Sera from apparently healthy 20 male horses and 20 oxen were obtained and aliquots of serum were divided into 3 portions. The first tube was used for baseline (T0) measurement of analyte values, whereas the other two tubes, T1 and T2, were stored at −20°C for 1 and 2 months, respectively, and analyte measurement was done. Results: Results showed that the stability of TP (g/dL), URA (mg/dL) and TC (mg/dL) in oxen was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In horses, the stability of URA (mg/dL), TP (g/dL) and TG (mg/dL) were also statistically significant (p < 0.05). Additionally, URA and TC in oxen exceed TEa following measurement at T2 and TG in horses following measurement at T1 and T2. Conclusion: Laboratories should consider the storage temperature and time for specific analytes among animals. Therefore, stability studies at various storage temperatures and times are recommended to fully validate the stability of the analytes. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Cryopreservation is a stressful process for sperm, as it is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated ROS levels, which create an imbalance with antioxidant capacity, may result in membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein damage and DNA fragmentation. This study aimed to determine whether the membrane LPO and DNA fragmentation of frozen–thawed horse sperm relies upon antioxidant activity, including enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) and paraoxonase type 1 (PON1)); non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), plasma ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC)); and the oxidative stress index (OSI) of their seminal plasma (SP). Based on total motility and plasma membrane integrity (SYBR14+/PI−) after thawing, ejaculates were hierarchically (p < 0.001) clustered into two groups of good- (GFEs) and poor-(PFEs) freezability ejaculates. LPO and DNA fragmentation (global DNA breaks) were higher (p < 0.05) in the PFE group than in the GFE group, with LPO and DNA fragmentation (global DNA breaks) after thawing showing a positive relationship (p < 0.05) with SP OSI levels and ROS production. In addition, sperm motility and membrane integrity after thawing were negatively (p < 0.05) correlated with the activity levels of SP antioxidants (PON1 and TEAC). The present results indicate that LPO and DNA fragmentation in frozen–thawed horse sperm vary between ejaculates. These differences could result from variations in the activity of antioxidants (PON1 and TEAC) and the balance between the oxidant and antioxidant components present in the SP. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The biological barriers of the body, such as the blood–brain, placental, intestinal, skin, and air-blood, protect against invading viruses and bacteria while providing necessary physical support. However, these barriers also hinder the delivery of drugs to target tissues, reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanostructures with a diameter ranging from 30 nm to 10 μm secreted by cells, offer a potential solution to this challenge. These natural vesicles can effectively pass through various biological barriers, facilitating intercellular communication. As a result, artificially engineered EVs that mimic or are superior to the natural ones have emerged as a promising drug delivery vehicle, capable of delivering drugs to almost any body part to treat various diseases. This review first provides an overview of the formation and cross-species uptake of natural EVs from different organisms, including animals, plants, and bacteria. Later, it explores the current clinical applications, perspectives, and challenges associated with using engineered EVs as a drug delivery platform. Finally, it aims to inspire further research to help bioengineered EVs effectively cross biological barriers to treat diseases. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study quantified the extent of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in ascarid and strongylid nematodes against commonly used anthelmintics in Australian Thoroughbred horses. Faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRTs, n = 86) and egg reappearance period (ERP) tests were conducted on 22 farms across Australia. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were determined using the modified McMaster technique, and percent faecal egg count reduction (%FECR) was calculated using the Bayesian hierarchical model and hybrid Frequentist/Bayesian analysis method. The results were interpreted using old (published in 1992) and new (2023) research guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP). The species composition of strongylid nematodes was detected utilising a DNA-metabarcoding method using pre- and post-treatment samples. Resistance was observed in strongylid nematodes to commonly used single-active and combination anthelmintics, including ivermectin (IVM %FECR range: 82%–92%; 95% lower credible interval (LCI) range: 80%–90%), abamectin (ABM: 73%–92%; 65%–88%), moxidectin (MOX: 89%–91%; 84%–89%), oxfendazole (OFZ: 0%–56%; 0%–31%) and its combination with pyrantel (OFZ + PYR: 0%–82%; 0%–78%). Resistance in Parascaris spp. was observed to IVM (10%–43%; 0%–36%), ABM (0%; 0%) and MOX (0%; 0%). When the new thresholds recommended by the WAAVP were used, AR was detected in six additional FECRTs for strongylids and three more tests for Parascaris spp., introducing resistance to OFZ and OFZ + PYR in the latter. Shortened ERPs (4–6 weeks) of strongylids were observed in 31 FECRTs in which AR was not detected at 2 weeks post-treatment for all the anthelmintics tested. Among cyathostomins, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus and Coronocyclus coronatus were the most prevalent species at 2 weeks post-treatment, whereas the main species appearing at five weeks following treatments with macrocyclic lactones were Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus and Cylicocyclus ashworthi. After treatment with OFZ + PYR, the latter three, plus Coronocyclus coronatus and Cyathostomum catinatum, were detected at 5 weeks post-treatment. Overall, the study highlights the prevalence of AR in both ascarids and strongylid nematodes against commonly used anthelmintic products to control worms in Australian horses. The results indicate that ML combination products provided acceptable efficacy at 2 weeks. However, ERP calculations suggest that products work less effectively than previously measured. It is suggested to regularly monitor the efficacy of the anthelmintics and consider changing the worm control practices to better manage worms and AR in Australian horses. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Staphylococci are well-known opportunistic pathogens associated with suppurative diseases in humans and animals. Antimicrobial resistance is an emergent threat to humans and animals worldwide. This study investigated the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRS) in hospitalized horses and contacting personnel (veterinarians and staff), and assessed possible interspecies transmission in a teaching veterinary hospital. Nasal swabs from horses (n = 131) and humans (n = 35) were collected. The microorganisms were identified by traditional biochemical tests and genotypic methods, i.e., PCR, internal transcript spacer PCR (ITS-PCR), and gene sequencing. Staphylococcal species were isolated in 18% (23/131) of the horses, of which 8% (11/131) were S. hyicus, 4 % (5/131) were S. aureus, 4% (5/131) were S. pseudintermedius, and 2% (2/131) were S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans. The mecA gene was detected in an S. pseudintermedius isolate. Staphylococcus spp. was isolated in 40% (14/35) of the human samples, all of which were S. aureus. In four samples of S. aureus, the clonal profile ST398 was identified; among them, a clonal similarity of 98.1% was observed between a horse and a contacting human. This finding supports the need for biosecurity measures to avoid the spread of multidrug-resistant staphylococci in humans and horses. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to compare the morphometry of horse and mule embryos. The study's hypothesis was that the micronuclei and nuclear fragmentation indexes are higher in mule embryos than in horse embryos. Twenty-two mares were randomly assigned in a crossover design to receive semen from a horse and a donkey; thirteen horse and thirteen mule embryos were obtained. Embryos were recovered eight days post-ovulation and classified according to the stage of development and quality with a score from 1 (excellent) to 4 (degenerate). Embryos were stained with Hoechst33342, and images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope. Nuclei were categorized as compact, mitotic, or fragmented; the fragmented and mitotic indexes were calculated based on their proportion over the total amount of nuclei counted. Embryo size and nuclear morphometry were assessed through ImageJ. Data analyses were carried out with GraphPad using ANOVA and T-test; significance was set at P < 0.05. The number of positive flushes in cycles bred with donkey or stallion semen did not differ when compared per cycle or per ovulation (13 vs. 12) (P > 0.05). One set of twins was recovered from a mare bred to the stallion that had a double ovulation; a mule and horse embryos were both recovered from eight mares. There was no difference in size between mule and horse embryos (915.5 ± 288 μm vs. 575.8 ± 69.6 μm) (P > 0.05) size of the study. The mule embryos scored between grade 1 (n = 9) and grade 2 (n = 4); similarly, the horse embryos scored between grade 1 (n = 6) and grade 2 (n = 7). The evaluation of the nuclear morphometry revealed that horse and mule embryos have a similar number of compact nuclei per sector (148.7 ± 6.8 nuclei/sector in mule embryos vs. 156.5 ± 8.5 nuclei/sector in horse embryos) (P > 0.05); however, the number of mitotic nuclei tended to be higher in mule embryos (5.2 ± 0.82) than in horse embryos (3.3 ± 0.3) (P = 0.08). The fragmented nuclei index was similar between mule (0.25 ± 0.1%) and horse (0.22 ± 0.1%) embryos (P = 0.4); the mitotic nuclei index was higher in mule embryos (3.2 ± 0.4%) than in horse embryos (2.2 ± 0.2%) (P = 0.02). In conclusion, embryo morphology of mares bred to a donkey and a horse shares similar nuclear ultrastructure features, except that mule embryos have a higher mitotic index. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In this study, the distribution patterns of southern horse mackerel are examined using commercial fine-scale resolution data. Using landings by size category and VMS data from the Portuguese commercial bottom-trawl fishery, which consistently targets horse mackerel, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of horse mackerel age distributions spanning a decade (2010–2020). Importantly, this study addresses potential biases in commercial effort data and establishes the usefulness of commercial bottom-trawl gear as a suitable method for sampling and evaluating southern horse mackerel stock dynamics. Ordered regression models were applied to allow for the modelling of the distribution of multiple age categories and investigate spatio-temporal migrations off the Portuguese coast. Southern horse mackerel show a widespread age distribution range and stable abundance with indications of seasonal and spatial patterns in the distribution of specific age groups. The insights derived from this research contribute valuable knowledge for understanding the dynamics and distribution patterns of fish populations. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Ammonia (NH3) and bicarbonate (HCO3) have been related to gastric ulcers in humans. Ammonia is considered a possible cause of gastric ulcers, whereas bicarbonate has a protective function. The presence of ulcers in the stomach of horses is defined as Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS), which is a frequent disease in this species, and it has been associated with changes in saliva composition, such as in analytes related to inflammation, immune system and oxidative stress. The objectives of this study were (1) to perform an analytical validation of two automated spectrophotometric assays, one for ammonia and one for bicarbonate, in the horses’ saliva and (2) to evaluate their possible variations with EGUS. Analytical validation of the automated assays for ammonia and bicarbonate in the saliva of horses showed that both assays were precise and accurate. In addition, significantly higher values of ammonia and lower values of bicarbonate were found in the saliva of horses with EGUS compared to healthy horses. It can be concluded that ammonia and bicarbonate can be measured in the saliva of horses and that ammonia increases and bicarbonate decreases in this sample type could be related to the presence of EGUS in this species. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To assess the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture in combination with Chinese herbs for treatment of horses affected with anhidrosis. ANIMALS 44 horses affected with anhidrosis for up to 3 years' duration were enrolled. Inclusion required both compatible clinical signs and results of a quantitative intradermal terbutaline sweat test. METHODS Study horses were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 19) was treated with daily Chinese herbs and 4 weekly acupuncture sessions. Group 2 (n = 25) was given daily hay powder as a placebo and 4 weekly sham acupuncture sessions. Horses were tested by quantitative intradermal terbutaline sweat test within 2 days after treatment completion and again 4 weeks following treatment. RESULTS Terbutaline-induced sweat responses (mg) were not different between groups within 2 days and 4 weeks after treatment. Two days after treatment, ratios of sweat responses (compared to baseline) were higher (P < .05) in the treatment group compared to the placebo group at terbutaline concentrations of 1.0, 100, and 1,000 μg/mL. The number of horses responding to treatment was higher in the treatment group (5/19 [26%]), compared to horses in the placebo group (1/25 [4%]) for 1 of 5 terbutaline concentrations 2 days (10 μg/mL) or 4 weeks (0.1 μg/mL) after treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Ratios of sweat responses were higher in treatment horses 2 days after treatment, compared to baseline, but not 4 weeks later. The efficacy of a traditional Chinese veterinary medicine protocol for anhidrosis treatment with acupuncture and Chinese herbs was low but higher in treated horses compared with placebo. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Cribbing is an oral stereotypic behavior in horses. Cribbing behavior (CB) has been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and gastric ulceration. This randomized crossover study aimed to evaluate the hypotheses that there would be differences in GI microbiota between horses receiving a gastric health support supplement or a placebo, as well as differences between cribbing horses (CBH) and noncribbing horses (NCBH). Mature Quarter Horses with CB (n = 4) and sex-matched noncribbing controls (NCB; n = 4) were randomly assigned to receive either a GI support supplement (TRT) or a placebo for 21 days, followed by a 2-week washout period. Treatment groups were then switched, and horses were treated for an additional 21 days. Before and after each treatment period, feces and gastric fluid samples were collected for microbiome analysis. Horses were acclimated for 2 weeks before the start of the study, individually stalled for 16 h/d, fed bermudagrass hay (1.2% body weight [BW], dry matter [DM] basis), and concentrated (0.5% BW), and turned out in pairs in paddocks for 8 h/d throughout the study. Fecal microbiota differed between CBH and NCBH (P = 0.001), although microbiota remained unaffected by TRT. No differences were found in the gastric microbiota between CBH and NCBH or between TRT and placebo. Administration of the supplement did not alter the GI environment of NCBH or CBH; however, a link between cribbing and fecal microbiota was found, suggesting that CBH may have a disrupted gut microbiome. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Warm-up is a standard component of exercise preparation, intended to lower the risk of injury and improve performance. Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines per discipline are missing. This scoping review aimed to describe the physiological effects and strategies of active warm-up in horses according to different equestrian disciplines. The search strategies identified 479 papers for review. After application of selection criteria, 23 articles published from 1996 to January 2024 were included of which 12 discussed the effects of warm-up on physiological parameters and 11 discussed warm-up strategies in different disciplines. As shown in humans, warm-up enhanced aerobic capacity and increased blood and muscle temperatures, independently from its intensity. Riders emphasized the importance of warm-up to prepare horses for physical work and to increase their reactiveness to aids. A canter or trot was the preferred gait in elite or non-elite dressage horses, respectively, while the walk was in show jumping horses. Warm-up duration and intensity increased with increasing competitive level, but a longer and/or more intensive warm-up did not affect the final score. Dressage riders warmed up their horses for a longer time compared to show jumping riders. Future studies should objectively establish the most profitable warm-up strategies per equestrian discipline and level. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Atmospheric cold plasma (CP), an acclaimed nonthermal technology, has gained popularity for its effective microbial inactivation in food materials, concurrently improving functional and nutritional aspects. Despite the nutraceutical benefits, horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) is underutilized in baking and confectionery due to presence of major antinutrients. Our aim is to leverage CP to enhance horse gram's properties, promoting its viability in these sectors. The present study investigates the effect of CP treatment with varying output voltage (10–30 kV) and exposure time (5–25 min) on horse gram flour's nutritional, functional, and antinutritional properties. Moreover, the molecular interactions, crystallinity, thermal stability, and morphological characteristics were analyzed. CP treatment doubled the nutritional properties of horse gram flour and amplified the functional attributes by 1.5 times as compared to untreated flour, but excessively higher voltage (30 kV) and time (15 and 25 min) declined them. Whereas the antinutritional components—tannin, saponin, and phytic acid—were reduced to 1.43 ± 0.01 μg TAE/g, 0.72 ± 0.01 mg diosgenin/g, and 5.26 ± 0.03 mg phytate/g, respectively, after CP treatment, enhancing digestibility of the flour up to 75%. Principal component analysis illuminated the intricate relationship between CP treatment and flour attributes. Both low voltage (10 kV) with moderate exposure (15 and 25 min) and high voltage (30 kV) with shorter duration (5 min) exhibited favorable correlations with physiochemical, bioactive, and functional properties. Conversely, high voltage with prolonged exposure displayed a notable negative correlation with antinutritional properties, structural, and thermal characteristics, revealing the nuanced impact of treatment conditions on the quality of flour. Overall, CP can be recognized as a potential novel technique for the techno-functional reformation of underutilized food materials. Practical applications: The horse gram is one of the underutilized crops rather than being a huge source of health and nutritional benefits. On the other hand, cold plasma is a novel technique in food processing which can be used for improvement of structural and functional properties of food products. That is why the purpose of the study not only was to enlighten the nutritional composition of the horse gram flour but also to improvise its techno functional qualities using cold plasma. However, the presence of the antinutrients in the horse gram flour acts as constraints for digestibility. The application of cold plasma on horse gram flour reduced the antinutrients present in it as well as improved the physiochemical and nutritional characteristics significantly. Moreover, the structural characteristics of the flour were affected by cold plasma which increased its stability for longer shelf life. Furthermore, the functionality of the flour was enhanced which showed an opportunity the better dough characteristic, emulsifying properties. These findings would help the usage of the horse gram flour as food ingredients in various bakery and confectionary food applications. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Heat shock proteins are the most evolutionarily conserved protein families induced by stressors including hyperthermia. In the context of pathologies of the male reproductive tract, cryptorchidism is the most common genital defect that compromises the reproductive potential of the male because it induces an increase in intratesticular temperature. In equine species, cryptorchidism affects almost 9 % of newborns and few studies have been carried out on the molecular aspects of the retained testis. In this study, the expression pattern of HSP60, 70, and 90 in abdominal and inguinal testes, in their contralateral descended normally testes, and in testes of normal horses were investigated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The histomorphological investigation of retained and scrotal testes was also investigated. The seminiferous epithelium of the retained testes showed a vacuolized appearance and displayed a completely blocked spermatogenesis for lacking meiotic and spermiogenetic cells. On the contrary, the contralateral scrotal testes did not show morphological damage and the seminiferous epithelium displayed all phases of the spermatogenetic cycle as in the normal testes. The morphology of Leydig cells was not affected by the cryptorchid state. Western blot and immunohistochemistry evidenced that equine testis (both scrotal and retained) expresses the three investigated HSPs. More in detail, the Western blot evidenced that HSP70 is the more expressed chaperone and that together with HSP90 it is highly expressed in the retained gonad (P < 0.05). The immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of the three HSPs in the spermatogonia of normal and cryptorchid testes. Spermatogonia of retained testes showed the lowest expression of HSP60 and the highest expression of HSP90. Spermatocytes, spermatids of scrotal testes, and the Sertoli cells of retained and scrotal testes did not display HSP60 whereas expressed HSP70 and HSP90. These two proteins were also localized in the nucleus of the premeiotic cells. The Leydig cells displayed the three HSPs with the higher immunostaining of HSP70 and 90 in the cryptorchid testes. The results indicate that the heat stress condition occurring in the cryptorchid testis influences the expression of HSPs. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To compare palpation and ultrasound scores of effusion of the medial femorotibial and femoropatellar joints of horses. ANIMALS 40 horses (80 stifles) were evaluated over a 12-week period. METHODS Horses > 1 year of age without history of stifle disease were enrolled from September to December 2022. Palpation of right and left medial femorotibial and femoropatellar joint compartments was performed. Amount of effusion was scored by a board-certified large animal surgeon, a third-year large animal surgery resident, and an equine sports medicine intern. Effusion of right and left medial femorotibial and femoropatellar joints was quantified with ultrasound by a board-certified equine sports medicine and rehabilitation clinician. Amount of effusion on palpation and ultrasound was graded as none-mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). A 2-way intraclass correlation coefficient evaluated interrater reliability of palpation scores. The Spearman rank correlation determined association between palpation and ultrasound scores. RESULTS Interrater reliability for palpation of effusion was poor between all observers for all joint compartments. No significant correlation was identified between palpation and ultrasound scores for any joint compartment for any observer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Clinicians often rely on palpation of joint effusion as an indication of stifle pathology. We found interrater reliability to be poor for palpation scores, indicating low agreement for palpation of joint effusion between clinicians within our group. No correlation was found between palpation and ultrasound scores for joint effusion, indicating that clinicians should not rely on palpation alone to quantify joint effusion of the medial femorotibial and femoropatellar joints. © AVMA.

ABSTRACT: Little literature exists on horses in adaptive horsemanship (AH) despite concerns about their well-being. The study objective was to evaluate behavioral and physiological responses of horses to ground-based AH lessons for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Lessons were expected to alter horses’ hormone concentrations, behavior, and muscle activity. Geldings were assigned to AH (n=6; 20.3 ± 1.9 yrs., mean ± SE) or control (CON; stall in arena, n=6; 13.8 ± 1.7 yrs.) conditions for 8-week sessions based on current occupation (AH = equine-assisted services; CON = recreational riding). Plasma cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and oxytocin concentrations from samples at 0 (start of lesson), 3, 5, 25, and 30 (end) min were determined using assays validated in horses. Surface electromyography (sEMG) (masseter and brachiocephalic; Noraxon, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and video were recorded continuously. Average rectified values (ARV) and median frequency (MF) were calculated (100 ms) after sEMG data were normalized, rectified, and filtered. The number, number of unique, and duration of stress related behaviors (ethogram) were recorded by three trained (ĸ ≥ 0.7) observers. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVAs (significance P ≤ 0.05) with fixed effects of treatment, time point, week, and their interactions as appropriate and random effect of horse. CON horses had elevated cortisol concentrations (P = 0.0023) at 25 and 30 min. AH horses displayed fewer (P ≤ 0.0491) stress related and unique behaviors. CON horses were described as more (P < 0.0001) anxious, nervous, and stressed than AH horses (calm, comfortable, patient, and relaxed) in qualitative behavior analysis (22 observers). AH horses were less stressed than CON horses. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to examine the nutrient composition and feed hygiene of alfalfa as well as investigate the feed intake, blood, urine and faecal parameters of horses fed alfalfa haylage (AS) compared with alfalfa hay (AH) and meadow hay (MH). A total of 11 geldings were fed ad libitum (2.1% dry matter (DM) of body weight (BW)) with alfalfa haylage, alfalfa hay and meadow hay (MH) in a Latin square design. On days 0 and 21 of the feeding period, blood samples were analysed for kidney and liver parameters. Faecal samples were analysed for pH, DM and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Spontaneous urine was collected during the feeding period to analyse selected parameters. Forage was analysed in terms of feed hygiene and crude nutrients. In several feed samples of AS, AH and MH, the microbial reference ranges were exceeded for product-typical and spoilage-indicating bacteria and fungi. Crude nutrient analyses revealed a median crude protein content of 139 (138/142) g/kg DM for AS, which was similar to that in AH (127–135 g/kg DM) and substantially higher than in MH (79.1–87.7 g/kg DM). The calcium level in AS (11.3 g/kg DM) was significantly higher than that in MH (4.00–4.95 g/kg DM) but not compared with that in AH (9.80–10.4 g/kg DM). All blood parameters were within the reference ranges. Fractional excretion (FE)Ca for AS-fed horses ranged from 8.13 to 22.0%; the FECa for AH-fed horses ranged from 6.48 to 24.8%; the FECa for MH-fed horses ranged from 6.69 to 53.2%. No significant differences were found in faecal pH or SCFA content in AS-fed horses compared with AH-fed and MH-fed horses. We concluded that alfalfa haylage provides an alternative forage for equine nutrition. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Metformin is a widely prescribed oral antihyperglycemic agent and currently a first-line medication in the treatment of human type 2 diabetes, with a total of 92 million US prescriptions in 2022. The daily dose per human can be as much as 2.5 grams/day which is excreted largely unchanged into the environment. Metformin is chemically stable and a widely distributed environmental substance. Metformin therefore has the potential to be identified at trace levels in equine blood and urine samples as a result of random exposure to environmental metformin. Given these circumstances we have reviewed the scientific literature and calculated an irrelevant blood/plasma/serum concentration of metformin of 5 nanograms/ml. We now therefore propose this plasma concentration of metformin as an interim Screening Limit of Detection (SLOD) for metformin, below which concentration a blood/plasma/serum identification of metformin should not be considered appropriate for regulatory action. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Ecologists strive for laws that explain interactions between organisms. Myriad hypotheses have been fundamental in increasing our understanding of plant–herbivore interactions, including the forage maturation hypothesis (FMH). The FMH has recently been extended to include contingencies of body size and digestive system: selection for greater energy potential should be negatively correlated with body mass and selection for proximity to surface water should be greater for hindgut fermenters compared to foregut fermenters or ruminants. While these general trends hold at a broad scale, intrapopulation variability still exists. For feral species that did not coevolve within their current ecological context, variability in habitat selection among populations may be greater. Consequently, understanding habitat selection of each population is imperative to properly inform management. For the case of feral horses, Equus ferus caballus, a large-bodied hindgut fermenter, understanding how they compare in habitat selection to sympatric species is of particular interest due to habitat alteration and potential competition. Across much of their range in western North America, horses are sympatric with the smaller-bodied ruminant pronghorn, Antilocapra americana. The two species overlap in space use, but we lack information on how each species selects resources within areas of overlap. Accordingly, we compared habitat selection between these two species during the growing season to understand how each responded to predictions of the FMH and to better guide potential management actions. Horses followed FMH predictions by selecting proximity to surface water and greater forage biomass. Meanwhile, pronghorn did not follow predictions of the FMH; pronghorn selected greater forage biomass but did not select greater energy potential. Both species selected greater herbaceous cover, flatter slopes and farther distances from oil and gas well pads. Our analysis reveals a high degree of selection overlap and underscores the importance of conducting population level studies to best understand how herbivores interact with the unique environments they inhabit. © 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to determine whether adult horses can learn to recognise a novel word and how important the familiarity of a human's voice uttering the taught word is. In the study, 18 adult warmblood horses were the subjects: nine mares and nine geldings. At the beginning, the horses were habituated to voices heard from loudspeakers located near boxes for three days. The horses were listening to two familiar people (A and B) and one unfamiliar person (C) whose voices were recorded in the playback individually. Next, each horse was taught to positively associate a novel word with receiving a titbit for 10 days, 15 times daily: 12 times by the person who uttered the word and 3 times when the word was heard from playback. The same three people were engaged during the teaching. Finally, the horses were tested whether they had learned the word. The word was uttered by one familiar person (A), the initially unfamiliar person (C) and a totally unknown person (D). The voices of these people were played solely from the loudspeaker three times daily. The horses’ response was evaluated by nine kinds of behaviour recorded. The first test with the three people's voices was repeated for up to five three-day cycles, dependent on manifesting by the horses a minimum number of behaviours per day. Apart from each tested horse, one companion horse remaining in a neighbouring box and taught another word with a titbit was studied to compare the response. The results show that horses perceived differences between single words, and associated a taught word with receiving a titbit. The companion horses did not respond to this word. The responses to familiar or unfamiliar people's voices were similar. It was concluded that horses are capable of discriminating a taught word and, simultaneously, generalise familiar and unfamiliar human voices uttering the word. These findings show that teaching horses single words is effective. Simultaneously, the results highlight the need to consistently use chosen words when teaching horses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Anaplasmosis, a tick-borne disease with worldwide distribution, impacts ruminants, equines, carnivores, and humans. This study aimed to investigate Anaplasma phagocytophilum in horses from Ardabil province and Anaplasma ovis in small ruminants from East Azerbaijan province using the Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein of 100 healthy horses in the Ardabil province and 156 healthy sheep and goats (116 sheep and 40 goats) in the East Azerbaijan province during the spring and summer seasons of 2016 in northwest Iran. The collected blood samples were stored at -20°C until the molecular experiments were conducted. Nested PCR was employed to detect A. phagocytophilum in horses and A. ovis in small ruminants using extracted DNA and amplifying 16S rRNA and msp4 genes. The Chi-square test of independence was used to determine the relationship between Anaplasma spp., infection, and independent variables, including age, gender, animal species, and sampling location. None of the 100 samples collected from horses in the Ardabil province were positive for A. phagocytophilum. In the East Azerbaijan province, 11 out of the 156 (7.05%) blood samples collected from sheep and goats tested positive for A. ovis. In addition, A. ovis infection was not significantly related to the independent variables. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequence obtained in this study (MH790273) had 100% homology with the sequence obtained from sheep infected with Anaplasma in Ahvaz province (JQ621903.1). The findings of this study can contribute to the prevention and control of anaplasmosis in farm animals in northwestern Iran. © 2024 Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background and purpose: Biological monitoring of trace element horses is a well-known tool for investigating potential bioaccumulation in urbanized and industrialized geographical areas. Some biomaterials such as hoof are considered as an important indicator of environmental pollution. Hooves can store trace elements for a long time compared to blood and this represents a scientific key to long-term monitoring of exposure to environmental pollutants. In the present study, samples of equine hoof and blood were taken from an experimental group of horses living in an industrialized area of Sicily (Italy) and from a control group of horses housed in a non-industrialized area of Sicily to evaluate the bioaccumulation of different trace elements in different substrates. Methods: Hoof and blood mineral concentration of Li- Lithium, Cu- Copper, Zn- Zinc, Sr- Strontium and, Pb- Lead was processed by means of Thermo Scientific iCAP-Q ICP–MS spectrometer. Student T-test was applied to evaluate the differences between groups and substrates. Correlation analysis between substrates and hematological parameters was performed. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant statistical difference for Li (p < 0.0001) and Pb (p < 0.0001) between blood and hoof in both groups. A statistically significant difference was observed for Li (p < 0.0001), Cu(p < 0.01), Zn (p < 0.0001) and Pb (p < 0.0001) between substrates in the experimental group. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference of blood Zn (p < 0.01) and hoof Pb (p < 0.01) concentration between groups. Our results revealed a statistically higher concentration of minerals in the blood substrate than in the hoof in both groups. Li (p < 0.0001) and Zn (p < 0.001) were positively correlated between control and experimental group in blood substrate. No correlations were found (P > .05) in hoof between groups for other elements. A positive correlation with WBC was observed in Cu concentration for hoof substrate (p < 0.02) in control group and for Zn in experimental group (p < 0.02). A positive correlation with HGB and HCT was observed for Cu hoof concentration (p < 0.02) in experimental group and PLT resulted positively correlated (p < 0.02) with Pb blood substrate in control group. Conclusions: Horses were not overexposed to these elements in the analyzed groups. The study highlights the role of a new bioaccumulation substrate such as the horse hoof identified as an analytical matrix for the monitoring of heavy metal concentrations in domestic animals. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: This article focuses on optimizing electric vehicle charging in distribution networks, emphasizing technical and economic considerations. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed intelligent approach tailors each EV's charging based on specific daily trip energy requirements. Vehicle owners provide trip data to the charge management system, enabling precise charging calculations considering factors such as energy tariffs, distribution network limits, and charging levels. The paper introduces the horse herd optimization algorithm, inspired by horse herd behavior, offering advantages like reduced computational time and improved convergence in maximizing power generation, especially under shading conditions. The comparative analysis of smart EV charging under normal and fast conditions, considering various constraints and load response programs, demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness. Numerical results reveal a 46.02 % average load reduction and a 20.53 % peak load decrease with a Load Response Program. Charging costs are optimized, with Case 2 exhibiting a 2.61 % cost reduction compared to Case 3. The study delves into charging frequencies, discharge frequencies, total unsupplied energy, and unloaded energy for each case, providing crucial insights into algorithmic performance. The horse herd optimization algorithm-based approach proves superior, offering a promising solution for efficient and cost-effective electric vehicle charging in distribution networks. Furthermore, graphical representations illustrate the algorithm's impact on charging power, energy allocation, power passing through distribution posts, and megavolt-ampere flow through network lines. These numerical and graphical analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the horse herd optimization algorithm capabilities, emphasizing its potential to optimize power distribution, reduce costs, and enhance the resilience of residential distribution networks. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Nebulized administration of dexamethasone on cytokine regulation in horses with moderate asthma has not been investigated. Objective: To investigate the changes in expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA after nebulized administration of dexamethasone treatment of horses with moderate asthma. Animals: Horses with naturally occurring moderate asthma (n = 16) and healthy control horses (n = 4). All horses were kept in a dusty environment during the study. Methods: Prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial. Blood endogenous cortisol, tracheal mucus, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were sampled before and after 13 days treatment with either nebulized administration of dexamethasone (15 mg once daily) or 0.9% saline (3 mL). Treatment groups were randomly allocated via randomization function (Microsoft Excel). Amplification of target mRNA in BAL fluid (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, IFN-γ, Eotaxin-2, and TNF-α) was achieved by qPCR, and the relative expression software tool was used to analyze BAL inflammatory cytokine mRNA. Results: Horses treated with nebulized administration of dexamethasone had increased relative expression of IL-5 (1.70-fold), IL-6 (1.71-fold), IL-17 (3.25-fold), IL-12 (1.66-fold), and TNF-α (1.94-fold), and decreased relative expression of IL-23 (1.76-fold; P =.04) in samples collected on Day 14, in comparison to samples collected on Day 0 (all P <.05). Horses treated with nebulized administration of saline had no significant difference in the relative expression of any gene (all P >.05). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Nebulized administration of dexamethasone was associated with increased expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report findings, outcome and determine variables associated with survival in horses with acquired inguinal hernia (AIH). Study design: Retrospective study. Animals: A total of 98 cases in 97 horses. Methods: The medical records (2005–2020) of horses diagnosed with AIH were reviewed. Retrieved data included signalment, history, clinical variables, surgical aspects, postoperative complications, and short- and long-term outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with short-term survival (p <.05). Results: Manual reduction was attempted in a third of the cases (32/98, 33%) and emergency surgery to reduce the hernia was performed in 64 of 98 (65%) cases. Concurrent small intestinal (SI) volvulus was identified in 26 (26/98, 27%) cases. Castration was the most common technique used to prevent recurrence (64/94, 68%). Overall AIH recurrence rate was 11% (11/98). A total of 59 (59/98, 60%) cases survived to hospital discharge and 49 of 52 (94%) cases were still alive after 12 months. Cases admitted within 10 h of colic signs had increased odds of survival (72%) compared to those admitted after 10 h (26%; p <.001). Draft breeds (p =.021), high heart rate on admission (p =.001) and concurrent SI volvulus (p =.048) were associated with reduced survival to hospital discharge. Conclusions: Horses with AIH had a higher risk of concurrent SI volvulus and lower survival than reported. Draft breeds, high heart rate on admission and concurrent SI volvulus were associated with reduced short-term survival. Clinical significance: The results of this study should help in prognostication for horses with AIH. © 2023 The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Depigmentation is a common phenotype in Equus caballus (horse); over 50 identified variants cause white spotting on the skin and coat. HPS5 may influence melanocyte proliferation and mutations in this gene cause depigmentation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Here we report three equine HPS5 mutations, found in most major breed groups and associated with white spotting. We used a standardized method to quantitatively grade depigmentation, creating a White Score for each horse. We identified associations to each of three variants in HPS5 by comparing the average white score for carriers to that of 41 control horses possessing none of the studied variants. We estimated the functional impact of each mutation using SIFT, GenScan, I-TASSER and cross-species conservation. The first mutation, S1013C termed Eden White 1 (EDXW1), is a missense mutation found to increase average depigmentation by 5.56 points (p = 6.47E-6, n = 70, t-test). Eden White 2 (EDXW2), a missense mutation L560F, increased depigmentation by 9.5 points for individuals with one copy of the variant, but we were unable to phenotype homozygotes (p = 5.55E-16, n = 47, t-test). Eden White 3 (EDXW3), a putative donor splice site mutation at exon 4 + 4, increased white by 5.59 points on average (p = 9.56E-6, n = 101). EDXW1 and EDXW3 are epistatically influenced by MC1R, the gene that controls black vs red coat color in horses. Individuals possessing the dominant E allele produce black pigment, and this allele was associated with higher levels of depigmentation than individuals with the recessive chestnut genotype (e/e) (p = 1.50E-5, p = 1.26E-5 respectively). We tested for epistatic interactions between EDXW1 and Dominant White 20 and found that horses with one copy of each allele had increased average white spotting by 8 points with respect to EDXW1/n or W20/n horses. Compound heterozygotes were significantly more white than horses with one copy of either mutation (p = 7.33E-5), but interactions between other white spotting alleles and EDXW alleles remain to be tested. We propose the convention Eden White (EDXW) for HPS5 mutations in the domestic horse. © 2024

ABSTRACT: A 19-year-old Cob mare with atrial fibrillation (AF) presented for transvenous electric cardioversion (TVEC). Under general anaesthesia, three successive incremental electric shocks were given (total 750 J) and sinus rhythm was temporarily restored. After 13 s, AF recurred so a fourth shock (300 J) was given and intravenous (IV) amiodarone started. Shortly after, capnography revealed an acute drop in the end-tidal carbon dioxide, which was followed by agonal gasping. Echocardiography showed severe cardiac dysfunction. Successful cardiac resuscitation consisted, among others, of cessation of amiodarone and administration of dobutamine and adrenaline. This case report highlights the importance of capnography as a non-invasive means of cardiac output monitoring in equine anaesthesia which definitely contributed to a positive outcome in this case. It also emphasises the critical importance of early recognition and communication of complications within anaesthetic and cardiology teams. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and limitations associated with a minimally invasive ultrasound-assisted cutting thread technique for tenotomy of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) in horses. Study design: Ex vivo study. Sample population: Twenty cadaveric forelimbs. Methods: Forelimbs were placed on a jig to mimic a standing semiflexed position and the midmetacarpal region was prepared to perform tenotomy of the DDFT using a percutaneous technique with a cutting thread. For that purpose, the thread was placed percutaneously around the DDFT (first dorsally and then palmarly) with the aid of a curved 20 gauge spinal needle. Tendon palpation/manipulation and ultrasonographic assessment assisted thread placement. Procedure time and skin puncture size were recorded. Limbs were then dissected to evaluate the degree of DDFT transection and the presence of any iatrogenic lesions. Results: The DDFT was completely transected in all cases. Minor lesions of the superficial digital flexor tendon were found in 11/20 limbs and considered clinically irrelevant. However, the neurovascular bundle was damaged in 6/20 limbs (four limbs had nerve damage and two limbs had a nerve and either a palmar artery or vein damaged). The skin puncture hole sizes ranged from undetectable to 5 mm long. The average duration of the procedure was 7 min and 38 s (range: 4 min 56 s to 10 min 19 s). Conclusion: A DDFT tenotomy can be performed reliably with a percutaneous cutting thread technique. However, refinement of the technique is required to minimize iatrogenic damage. Clinical significance: The reported technique allows a DDFT tenotomy to be performed in a minimally invasive manner and has the potential to be clinically applicable. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: The paranasal sinuses of horses can be exposed through an osteoplastic flap to determine the cause of clinical signs of disease referable to the paranasal sinuses, such as facial deformity or abnormal chronic, unilateral nasal charge, or to remove abnormal contents within it, such as a progressive ethmoidal haematoma, an osteoma, a neoplasm, a cyst, inspissated exudate, a fungal granuloma or feed. The two types of osteoplastic flaps are the frontonasal flap and the maxillary flap. The frontonasal flap is the easier of the two to create and is the most commonly created flap because it provides direct or indirect access to all compartments of the ipsilateral paranasal sinuses. The maxillary flap provides good access to the rostral and caudal maxillary sinuses and is created most commonly to provide access to an orosinus fistula or the alveolus of a diseased maxillary molar to remove dental or osseous fragments. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Equine asthma (EA) is a respiratory syndrome associated with the increase of different leukocyte populations in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Its pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the mRNA expression of different cytokines in the BALF, different EA subtypes and lung function. Fifteen horses underwent physical examination, airway endoscopy, BALF cytology and lung function testing (8/15). One horse did not have evidence of EA and was used as healthy reference, while the others were classified as affected by neutrophilic or mixed granulocytic EA. Cells isolated from the residual BALF were used for IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A genes expression by quantitative RT-PCR., Cytokine expression was compared between groups, and their correlations with BALF leukocyte and lung function were evaluated. IL-1β expression was positively correlated with BALF neutrophils count (p=0.038, r=0.56) and with increased expiratory resistance (p=0.047, r=0.76). IFN-γ was correlated with BALF mast cells (p=0.029, r=0.58). IL-4 was higher in horses with mixed granulocytic EA than neutrophilic (p=0.008), positively correlated with BALF mast cells (p=0.028, r=0.59) and inversely with whole-breath (p=0.046, r=-0.76) and expiratory reactance (p=0.003, r=-0.93). Finally, IL-17A was inversely correlated with expiratory reactance (p=0.009, r=-0.92). These results support that multiple immune responses are involved in EA pathogenesis; innate, Th2, and Th17 responses. Innate immunity appeared associated with neutrophilic inflammation, and Th2 response with increased mast cells. The role of Th1 response in EA remains questionable. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: A 25-year-old mixed-breed equine with separate nodular cutaneous lesions in the right thoracic limb (RTL) and right ventral abdominal region was admitted to a Veterinary Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed on the RTL lesion and superficial cervical lymph node, and the results were suggestive of a malignant neoplasm known as myxosarcoma. Due to the unfavorable prognosis, the animal was euthanized. Based on the macroscopic and microscopic findings, the diagnosis of metastatic cutaneous myxosarcoma was confirmed. Although rare, this tumor should be considered as a differential diagnosis for cutaneous neoplasms in this species. © 2024 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.

ABSTRACT: Anaerobic co-digestion of waste wheat straw and horse manure in two steps was revealed as a promising option for renewable energy production in the form of hydrogen and methane. Addition of waste cooking oils, disposal of which could cause damage to health or the environment, as a third substrate for digestion, is suggested as an approach not only to help handle the increasing volume of food waste worldwide but also to improve process performance. In the present study, waste cooking oil, in a concentration of 5%, appeared to be a positive modulator of anaerobic digestion with the production of hydrogen and did not lead to inhibition of the hydrolysis phase. The overall efficiency of the two-stage anaerobic digestion of the mixture, which contains mainly lignocellulose waste, is positively dependent on thermochemical pretreatment with the alkali reagent (Ca(OH)2), but elevated temperature (55 °C) and cooking oil addition revealed the opportunity to omit the pre-treatment step. Nevertheless, the overall energy production was lower due to the methane production step. However, the addition of waste cooking oils to the process in which lig-nocellulose is not pretreated (V3) led to an increase in the methane production and energy yield compared to V1. The anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic waste is a complex process and comprises successive degradation pathways and syntrophic microbial associations’ activities, so the division in two reactors ensured suitable conditions for the microorganisms residing in each of them. In this study, along with the production of hydrogen and methane and the separation of the hydrolysis and methanogenesis stages, utilization of agriculture- and kitchen-generated wastes was realized in the context of waste-to-energy sustainable production methods. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: It is reported that outdoor housing of horses reduces stereotypic (SB) and aberrant (AB) behaviour, however, observation of the horse only when outdoors may not preclude it from being stereotypic when in the stable. The study objective was to determine if the observation of horses when they are outdoors only is sufficient for detecting stereotypic individuals. The second objective was to compare SB and AB in outdoor versus outdoor maintained horses. The SB, AB and aggression of horses maintained either 1), indoor system (n=19; IS) with four hours of turnout or 2), continuously in an outdoors system (n=20; OS), were observed for 10 h/horse. Overall 0–58.5% of horses presented such behaviours at least once. In both systems, a similar number of horses performed crib-biting, weaving, tongue playing, licking, wood chewing, coprophagy, geophagy, pawing, and aggression toward humans and horses. Grid biting, incisors sliding, box-walking and wall kicking were only observed in IS horses and only when in the box, and wood chewing only when outside. The IS horses displayed weaving behaviour only in the box. However, only when outdoors, IS horses displayed wood chewing, nibbling of faeces and soil. In IS horses, the frequency of tongue playing, licking, pawing and acts of aggression toward other horses was similar to that when in the stable. Thus, the observation of the horse only when outside the stable may be misleading when assessing stereotypies in horses. While paddocking reduces the SB and AB, it is possible that this could also be due to the lack of substrates for displaying them. It is concluded that in welfare assessment protocols for horses, maintained most of their time in the stable, the periods when they stay in their home boxes should be considered. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The reproductive cycle of equines tends to be seasonal and is influenced by factors such as light and temperature. The process and methods of regulating the mare oestrous cycle in the anestrus period are still immature. The effects of noncoding RNAs and mRNAs on the oestrous cycle have aroused much interest, but corresponding analyses of seasonal mare ovaries have not been reported. Here, we report a whole transcriptome analysis of the Mongolian horse ovarian cortex collected in anestrus and diestrus periods. In total, 1081 mRNAs, 205 lncRNAs, 54 circRNAs, and 13 miRNAs were upregulated in winter anestrus ovarian cortex (WAO), and 1261 mRNAs, 90 lncRNAs, 29 circRNAs, and 40 miRNAs were upregulated in summer diestrus ovarian cortex (SDO). The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs and target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs revealed some key functions and pathways that may be related to follicle and oocyte development. We found that estrogen-related pathways were enriched in different RNAs. Our data were used to generate miRNA, circRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA databases from the Mongolian horse ovary and differential expression profiles between WAO and SDO; these results provide clues for exploring methods of estrus regulation in mares during the anestrus period. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) has been managed as a single stock in the Black Sea and adjacent regions, and its genetic structure has been under debate for decades, emphasising the necessity for additional research to validate the stock structure. This study used geometric morphometrics for body shape, shape indices, and elliptical Fourier analysis for otolith shape to explore their morphological differences in the Eastern Black Sea, Middle Black Sea, and Sea of Marmara. The findings revealed considerable differences in body and otolith shapes across the examined regions, suggesting the existence of three separate stocks. The geometric morphometrics revealed evident differences in the snout, followed by the caudal peduncle and body depths. Both otolith shape indices and elliptic Fourier analysis revealed significant directional bilateral asymmetry between the left- and right-sided otoliths. The elliptic Fourier analysis revealed a non-overlapping surface difference of 2.12% between the reconstructed left and right otolith outline shapes. However, no significant differences in otolith shape were observed between males and females using either otolith side. In addition, otolith shape analysis using shape indices and elliptic Fourier analysis reliably supported the presence of three distinct stocks of T. mediterraneus. This study provides evidence supporting the recognition of multiple phenotypic stocks of T. mediterraneus. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to compare and correlate levels of ferritin, transferrin, iron and APPs in healthy horses and those surgically treated for strangulating colic. On admission, measurements of inflammatory markers related to iron and total protein, fibrinogen, albumin, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin were made. The study comprised 22 horses, divided into a control group (CG) of healthy horses (n = 10) and horses with surgically treated acute abdomen (n = 12), obstruction group (OG). The OG was subdivided according to the affected intestinal segment (small vs. large) and according to outcome (survivors vs. non survivors). The OG had higher haptoglobin (34.8±14.2 mg/dL vs 20.8±7.21 mg/dL) and transferrin (487±161 mg/dL vs 369±71.4 mg/dL) values and lower iron (96.9±65 µg/dL vs 218±105 µg/dL) values than the CG. The OG horses with large intestine obstruction had lower values of transferrin (374.6±130 mg/dL) than horses with small intestinal obstruction (598.6±98.9 mg/dL). There was no difference in outcome between horses with large and small intestinal obstruction. Ferritin levels were moderately correlated with total protein (r = 0.594; P = 0.042) and albumin (r = 0.584; P = 0.046) in OG. In the multivariate exploratory analysis, fibrinogen levels were higher in animals that did not survive. In conclusion, haptoglobin, transferrin and iron were useful inflammatory markers for colic in horses. The correlation of ferritin with other APPs shows a possible role of ferritin as an APP in horses. Fibrinogen levels are higher in horses with greater risk of death from strangulating obstructions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: A Gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming, and obligate anaerobic bacteria designated strain CBA3647T was isolated from a horse faecal sample in Jeju, Republic of Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain CBA3647T formed a distinct phyletic lineage from closely related species within the genus Peptostreptococcus. Based on comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337T is most closely related to strain CBA3647T with a 16S rRNA gene similarity of 98.31%, while similarity to other type strains is below 98.0%. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CBA3647T was 30.0 mol%. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization values between strain CBA3647T and the six Peptostreptococcus species were equal to or less than 24%. Cells were non-motile and oval-shaped cocci with catalase-positive and oxidase-negative activities. Growth occurred at 20–40°C (optimum, 35°C), pH 6–8 (optimum, pH 7), and in the presence of 0–2% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1%). Strain CBA3647T contained C14:0 iso and C16:0 as major fatty acids. Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and molecular properties of strain CBA3647T suggest that it represents a novel species in the genus Peptostreptococcus, which has been named Peptostreptococcus equinus sp. nov. The type strain is CBA3647T (=KACC 22891T= JCM 35846T). © 2024, Microbiology Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Horse's milk, with a high nutritional value and few allergenic proteins, could substitute cow's milk for infant consumption. Herein, a label-free, proteomic method was used to identify and compare milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and whey proteins from three different horse breeds: Selle Français (SF), Welsh pony (WP), and Tieling Draft Horse (TDH). In MFGMs, 16 (SF), 66 (WP), and 45 (TDH) unique proteins were identified, which are involved in the endocytosis, ribosome, and staphylococcus aureus infection pathways, respectively. In whey, 31 (SF), 75 (WP), and 23 (TDH) unique proteins were identified, which are involved in the autophagy–animal, phenylalanine metabolism, and Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathways, respectively. SF contained the lowest concentration of β-lactoglobulin, which can cause allergic reactions in humans. Our findings describe the nutritional differences and functional diversities of MFGM and whey proteins in different horse breeds, which could support developing formula more suitable for human infants. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The historical increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events in Spain during the last thirty years makes it a perfect location for the evaluation of climate change. Modeling the effects of climate change on domestic animals’ genetic diversity may help to anticipate challenging situations. However, animal populations’ short life cycle and patent lack of historical information during extended periods of time drastically compromise the evaluation of climate change effects. Locally adapted breeds’ gene pool is the base for their improved resilience and plasticity in response to climate change’s extreme climatic conditions. The preservation of these domestic resources offers selection alternatives to breeders who seek such improved adaptability. The Spanish endangered autochthonous Hispano-Arabian horse breed is perfectly adapted to the conditions of the territory where it was created, developed, and widespread worldwide. The possibility to trace genetic diversity in the Hispano-Arabian breed back around seven decades and its global ubiquity make this breed an idoneous reference subject to act as a model for other international populations. Climate change’s shaping effects on the genetic diversity of the Hispano-Arabian horse breed’s historical population were monitored from 1950 to 2019 and evaluated. Wind speed, gust speed, or barometric pressure have greater repercussions than extreme temperatures on genetic diversity. Extreme climate conditions, rather than average modifications of climate, may push breeders/owners to implement effective strategies in the short to medium term, but the effect will be plausible in the long term due to breed sustainability and enhanced capacity of response to extreme climate events. When extreme climatic conditions occur, breeders opt for mating highly diverse unrelated individuals, avoiding the production of a large number of offspring. People in charge of domestic population conservation act as catalyzers of the regulatory changes occurring during breeds’ climate change adaptive process and may identify genes conferring their animals with greater adaptability but still maintaining enhanced performance. This model assists in determining how owners of endangered domestic populations should plan their breeding strategies, seeking the obtention of animals more resilient and adapted to climate-extreme conditions. This efficient alternative is focused on the obtention of increased profitability from this population and in turn ensuring their sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Neonatal foals are born essentially agammaglobulinaemic and therefore must ingest colostrum or receive immunoglobulins to maintain health. Failure of passive transfer treatment involves administration of equine colostrum, plasma or commercial powdered colostrum (CPC). Anecdotal reports suggest the risk of anaphylaxis associated with plasma transfusion in neonates receiving CPC prior to gut closure. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in CPC may serve as a target for BSA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in donor equine plasma. Objectives: To determine the presence of BSA-specific IgE in samples of commercial equine plasma, samples were collected following routine vaccination in healthy horses and horses experiencing adverse vaccine reactions. Study design: Prospective observational. Methods: Serum was collected from: 65 healthy horses at days 0, 14, 28, 90, 180, 270 and 365 post-vaccination; 26 horses after vaccine reaction at days 1, 180 or 270 post-vaccination; 4 horses not vaccinated; and 9 horses from a commercial plasma donor herd. BSA-specific IgE was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Bovine serum albumin-specific IgE was not detected in non-vaccinated horses and was identified in all vaccinated horses. Younger horses demonstrated a trend for higher fold changes in post-vaccination BSA-specific IgE expression compared to older horses. No significant difference in BSA-specific IgE levels between commercial plasma donors and healthy horses was identified. No significant difference in post-vaccination BSA-specific IgE levels between the reactor and healthy horses at days 180 and 270 post-vaccination were identified. Main limitations: Small number of reactor horses at day 180 and 270 post-vaccination with most samples being collected 24 h. There were no healthy horse samples for 24 h post-vaccination; therefore, it was not possible to compare the groups at this timepoint. Conclusions: Horses may express BSA-specific IgE following vaccination. There may be a risk of hypersensitivity type reaction when veterinarians administer commercial plasma to neonatal foals consuming CPC prior to gut closure. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the importance of inshore estuarine habitats for the maintenance of offshore exploited stocks of the horse-eye jack Caranx latus, a marine tropical species of high economic value. Otoliths of 143 yearlings were used to develop a data set of multi-elemental fingerprints for different juvenile habitats of C. latus in northeastern Brazil, including 7 estuaries and the coastal zone. This data set was then compared to the signatures in the juvenile part of the otolith of 40 sub-adult and adult fish caught at sea to identify their origin. Although otolith multi-elemental concentrations overlapped for some of the estuaries investigated, the maximum overall discrimination accuracy between them was only 58%. However, grouping several estuaries according to their similarity in elemental signatures increased accuracy to 80%. In both cases, correct re-assignment rates for the coastal zone were above 94%, and strontium (Sr) was the most significant element in juvenile habitat discrimination. The remaining elements (B, Ba, Co, P, Rb, and Zn) allowed us to distinguish between 3 distinct groups of estuaries, for which correct re-assignment rates were 70−88%. Juvenile fingerprints in sub-adult and adult otoliths revealed that most of the fish in the local, exploited stock (75%) originate from an inshore estuarine habitat, particularly from larger estuaries under constant marine influence (32.5%).

ABSTRACT: Obtaining accurate and reliable gene expression results in real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) data analysis requires appropriate normalization by carefully selected reference genes, either a single or a combination of multiple housekeeping genes (HKGs). The optimal reference gene/s for normalization should demonstrate stable expression across varying conditions to diminish potential influences on the results. Despite the extensive database available, research data are lacking regarding the most appropriate HKGs for qRT-PCR data analysis in rabbit and horse adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Therefore, in our study, we comprehensively assessed and compared the suitability of some widely used HKGs, employing RefFinder and NormFinder, two extensively acknowledged algorithms for robust data interpretation. The rabbit and horse ASCs were obtained from subcutaneous stromal vascular fraction. ASCs were induced into tri-lineage differentiation, followed by the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment of the adipose-differentiated rabbit ASCs, while horse experimental groups were formed based on adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. At the end of the experiment, the total mRNA was obtained and used for the gene expression evaluation of the observed factors. According to our findings, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was identified as the most appropriate endogenous control gene for rabbit ASCs, while hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase was deemed most suitable for horse ASCs. The obtained results underscore that these housekeeping genes exhibit robust stability across diverse experimental conditions, remaining unaltered by the treatments. In conclusion, the current research can serve as a valuable baseline reference for experiments evaluating gene expression in rabbit and horse ASCs. It highlights the critical consideration of housekeeping gene abundance and stability in qPCR experiments, emphasizing the need for an individualized approach tailored to the specific requirements of the study. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Maternal condition is influenced by multiple variables that individuals experience at seasonal and local levels, and thus condition-dependent sex allocation is likely also multifactorial. Here, we test the Trivers-Willard Hypothesis (TWH) using a multivariable approach on a dataset of thoroughbred mare breeding records. There is no sex ratio variation when examined at univariable level, mirroring the usual approach to test condition-dependent sex allocation. Conversely, the multivariate model shows multiple variables interact to influence the likelihood of producing a male. Mare and management variables that represent better body condition is associated with an increase in likelihood of a male offspring. The magnitude and direction of sex ratio skew correspond closely with predicted mare energy balance, consistent with TWH predictions. Our findings therefore support the TWH and show that, while sex allocation is multifactorial, maternal energy status emerges as the dominant driver. The additive and agonistic interactions of different variables demonstrate that a multifactorial approach should be a key consideration in sex allocation studies. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The basal (bACTH) and post-thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation concentration of adrenocorticotropin (pACTH) are recommended for diagnosis of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). Many factors influence bACTH (e.g., disease, age, month) and some affect the results only in autumn (e.g., breed, colour, sex). There are discrepancies about the impact of feeding on b/pACTH. Objectives: To determine whether feeding, month, age, breed, colour, sex and body condition score affect b/pACTH. Study design: Prospective crossover. Methods: Sixty-one animals were divided into groups: healthy, PPID, treated-PPID. The b/pACTH was measured three times (1 mg protirelin; blood collection after 10 min; mid-November to mid-July) after different feedings: fasting, hay, hay + grain. Friedman's test was applied to evaluate the influence of feeding on b/pACTH and linear mixed model to evaluate impact of further factors. Results: The b/pACTH was not significantly affected by feeding (p = 0.7/0.5). The bACTH was lowest in healthy (29.3 pg/mL, CI 9–49.5 pg/mL) and highest in PPID-group (58.9 pg/mL, CI 39.7–78.1 pg/mL). The pACTH was significantly lower in healthy (396.7 pg/mL, CI 283.2–510.1 pg/mL) compared to PPID (588.4 pg/mL, CI 480.7–696.2 pg/mL) and treated-PPID group (683.1 pg/mL, CI 585.9–780.4 pg/mL), highest in July (881.2 pg/mL, CI 626.3–1136.3 pg/mL) and higher in grey (723.5 pg/mL, CI 577.5–869.4 pg/mL) than other colours (338.7 pg/mL, CI 324.8–452.5 pg/mL). The size of effect for those variables was >0.5. Main limitations: Small number of animals, subsequent bACTH measurements were significantly lower in each horse. Conclusions: There was no evidence that feeding influences the b/pACTH. There was evidence that pergolide affects the bACTH but it had little effect on pACTH. Further investigation of the impact of month and coat colour on b/pACTH is warranted to better interpret the results. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine influenza (EI) is a highly contagious viral disease of equids characterized by pyrexia and respiratory signs. Like other influenza A viruses, antigenic drift or shift could lead to a vaccine-induced immunity breakdown if vaccine strains are not updated. The aim of this study was to genetically characterize EIV strains circulating in Italy, detected in PCR-positive samples collected from suspected cases, especially in the absence of formal active surveillance. Methods: Between February and April 2019, blood samples and nasal swabs collected from each of the 20 symptomatic horses from North and Central Italy were submitted to the National Reference Centre for Equine Diseases in Italy to confirm preliminary analysis performed by other laboratories. Results: None of the sera analysed using haemagglutination inhibition and single radial haemolysis presented a predominant serological reactivity pattern for any antigen employed. All nasal swabs were positive with IAV RRT-PCR. Only one strain, isolated in an embryonated chicken egg from a sample collected from a horse of a stable located in Brescia, Lombardy, was identified as H3N8 Florida lineage clade 1 (FC1). In the constructed phylogenetic trees, this strain is located within the FC1, together with the virus isolated in France in 2018 (MK501761). Conclusions: This study reports the first detection of H3N8 FC1 in Italy, highlighting the importance of monitoring circulating EIV strains to verify the vaccine composition appropriateness for maximum efficacy. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial residues excreted in the environment following antimicrobial treatment enhance resistant microbial communities in the environment and have long-term effects on the selection and maintenance of antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRGs). In this study, we focused on understanding the impact of antimicrobial use on antimicrobial residue pollution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment of horse-breeding farms. Rhodococcus equi is an ideal microbe to study these associations because it lives naturally in the soil, exchanges AMRGs with other bacteria in the environment, and can cause disease in animals and humans. The environment is the main source of R. equi infections in foals; therefore, higher levels of multidrug-resistant (MDR) R. equi in the environment contribute to clinical infections with MDR R. equi. We found that macrolide residues in the environment of horse-breeding farms and the use of thoracic ultrasonographic screening (TUS) for early detection of subclinically affected foals with R. equi infections were strongly associated with the presence of R. equi carrying AMRGs in the soil. Our findings indicate that the use of TUS contributed to historically higher antimicrobial use in foals, leading to the accumulation of antimicrobial residues in the environment and enhancing MDR R. equi. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this case report, a high dose of torsemide (6mg/kg, every 12 hours for 3 days followed by 12mg/kg, every 12 hours for 4 days) was administered orally to a horse with congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation. Blood samples for measurement of plasma torsemide concentrations were obtained one hour after each drug administration. Pharmacodynamic effects of oral torsemide were evaluated by daily physical examination, electrocardiography, and serum biochemistry. The horse tolerated administration of torsemide. A decrease in ventral oedema and venous congestion was subjectively noted at day 7. Torsemide plasma concentration markedly increased at day 5 (peak concentration of 15.41 µg/mL). Evidence of an increase in renal markers was observed throughout the study period. Electrolyte measurements revealed mild hyponatremia and hypochloremia, and moderate hypokalaemia. No electrocardiographic changes related to torsemide administration were observed. After seven days of treatment, the horse was euthanised due to his disease stage and poor prognosis. Results indicate that torsemide was absorbed after oral administration and was well tolerated in this horse. Furthermore, clinical improvement in this single case indicates that torsemide might be utilized as an oral alternative to furosemide in the management of equine patients in CHF. The high doses of torsemide used in this case report should be reserved for cases without clinical response to lower doses and with close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function parameters. Further investigation of torsemide clinical efficacy and safety in horses with CHF with a larger cohort and prolonged administration is warranted. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: Reference ranges for intraocular pressure (IOP) in healthy animals are device-specific; therefore, it is strongly recommended to use appropriate reference values according to the device. Therefore, our aim was to compare IOP readings made by TonoVet® and TonoVet Plus® in healthy dogs, cats, sheep, cattle, and horses. We compared IOP values measured by TonoVet® and TonoVet Plus® tonometers in clinically normal eyes of dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and sheep. Materials and Methods: Five groups comprising 20 animals each of dogs (various breeds, 9 months–10 years old, 14 females, 6 males), cats (various breeds, 6 months–12 years old, 8 females, 12 males), horses (various breeds, 5–12 years old, 12 females, 8 males), cattle (Holstein, 1–7 lactation, female), and sheep (Latvian Darkhead ewes, 1–8 years old) were included in the study. Both eyes of all animals were subjected to ophthalmic examination, including evaluation of IOP by rebound tonometry using TonoVet® and TonoVet Plus® devices. Normality was determined using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The independent t-test was used to determine differences between IOP values in the right and left eyes and between both tonometers. This study was approved by the Ethical Commission of the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies (Nr. LLU_Dzaep_2022-2-4). Results: No differences in IOP between the right and left eyes were found in all cases (p > 0.05). The mean IOP ± standard deviation values in both eyes for TonoVet® and TonoVet Plus® tonometers were as follows: for dogs, 15.25 ± 2.73 mmHg and 19.65 ± 3.46 mmHg; and in cats, 18.88 ± 3.98 mmHg and 18.78 ± 4.26 mmHg, respectively. In horses, mean IOP was 22.15 ± 3.74 mmHg and 24.28 ± 3.00 mmHg; in cattle, 24.73 ± 2.89 mmHg and 23.28 ± 2.97 mmHg; and in sheep, 18.05 ± 3.54 mmHg and 22.49 ± 4.66 mmHg, respectively. Significant differences in IOP values were observed between the tonometers in sheep, dog, and horse groups (mean difference –4.40, –4.48, and 2.13, respectively). Conclusion: This study showed significantly higher IOP values measured by the TonoVet Plus® tonometer in dogs and sheep. © Kovalcuka, et al. Open Access.

ABSTRACT: The viral proteins VP1-1, VP2, VP4, VP7 and NS3, of African horse sickness virus serotype 4 (AHSV4), have previously been identified to contain CD8+ T cell epitopes. In this study, overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequences of these AHSV4 proteins were synthesized and used to map epitopes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from five horses immunized with an attenuated AHSV4 were stimulated in vitro with the synthesized peptides. Various memory immune assays were used to identify the individual peptides that contain CD8+ T cell epitopes, CD4+ T cell epitopes and linear B cell epitopes. The newly discovered individual peptides of AHSV4 proteins VP1-1, VP4, VP7 and/or NS3 that contain CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell or linear B cell epitopes could contribute to the design and development of new generation AHS peptide-based vaccines and therapeutics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of noncongenital atlanto-axial luxation in a 10-year-old Irish Draught mare. The mare initially presented to our referral hospital for dullness and colic signs. After resolution of the colic signs, the horse displayed increasing levels of dullness. Physical examination revealed that the horse could not flex and extend its neck freely to reach food from the ground. Radiographic and standing computed tomographic investigations revealed atlanto-axial luxation that was subsequently successfully reduced using a surgical approach under general anaesthesia. To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report describing the successful surgical treatment of presumed traumatic atlanto-axial luxation in an adult horse. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Trachurus trachurus [Linnaeus C (1758) Systema Naturae. Ed. 10th, 1: 824 p. (reprint 1956, London)] is abundant in Tunisian catches, with landings varying according to region and season. Due to its quantitative importance and economic contributions to the fishing sector, it is crucial to assess its biomass and locate its areas of concentration. Exploration and experimental trawling operations are conducted aboard the oceanographic vessel O/V “Hannibal” throughout the entire Tunisian sea. However, this study focuses on the findings in the north and east of the Tunisian sea. In the east area, the depth prospected varied from 40 m to 227 m with 49 hauls, while in the north area, the depth ranged between 30 m and 512 m with 53 hauls. Three important areas of Trachurus trachurus concentration were identified in the eastern waters, particularly in the Gulf of Hammamet, above Korba banks, Mamoura and Hallouf. The overall biomass index varied from 100 kg/km2 to 455 kg/km2 depending on the location. In the northern Tunisian waters, four specific areas of concentration of this species were noted, particularly toward the northeast of the Gulf of Tunis, above El Hawaria Bank at a depth of 100 m. The three other areas were located north of Bizerte, above the Cani Islands Bank; above Stafette and Fratelli benches; and toward the extreme northwest of Tunisia, south of Galite. The estimated biomass index ranges from 118 kg/km2 to 532 kg/km2. The statistical chi-squared test was applied to analyze and identify the difference between the two areas, using the Statistica 7 software. The findings revealed a variation in the length distribution between the northern and eastern Tunisian waters. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: What makes animal gaits so audibly rhythmic? To answer this question, we recorded the footfall sound of 19 horses and quantified the rhythmic differences in the temporal structure of three natural gaits: walk, trot, and canter. Our analyses show that each gait displays a strikingly specific rhythmic pattern and that all gaits are organized according to small-integer ratios, those found when adjacent temporal intervals are related by a mathematically simple relationship of integer numbers. Walk and trot exhibit an isochronous structure (1:1)—similar to a ticking clock—while canter is characterized by three small-integer ratios (1:1, 1:2, 2:1). While walk and trot both show isochrony, trot has a slower tempo and is more precise and accurate, like a metronome. Our results quantitatively discriminate horse gaits based on rhythm, revealing striking commonalities with human music and some animal communicative signals. Gait and vocal rhythmicity share key features, and the former likely predates the latter; we suggest this supports gait-based hypotheses for the evolution of rhythm. Specifically, the perception of locomotor rhythmicity may have evolved in different species under pressure for predator recognition and mate selection; it may have been later exapted for rhythmic vocal communication. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Monitoring the body condition of feral horses is important for animal welfare considerations and to anticipate population densities that affect the ecosystem. Monthly adult body condition scores (BCS) were estimated in a population of feral horses in an Argentine grassland nature reserve in 2001 and 2002, when the population reached maximum historical density approaching estimated carrying capacity. Monthly mean BCS showed a seasonal pattern. Female BCS was higher throughout 2001 with respect to 2002, while males only showed this pattern between wet seasons. BCS was higher for males than for females throughout the study and also higher during the wet season for both sexes. Mean monthly BCS of males was correlated to precipitation of the previous month, which is known to determine grass productivity in the area. Lower BCS values for females can be explained by the additional energy expenditure associated with pregnancy and lactation. In many cases, continuous monitoring of body condition is not possible and then it is important to identify times of the year when it is a more sensitive indicator of the population’s proximity to carrying capacity. For the area, this would be during the peak of rainfall in autumn or the minimum of rainfall in winter. The estimates corresponding to females would be especially accurate considering their dependence to density and rainfall. The implementation of management measures guided by BCS could avoid reaching population levels close to carrying capacity, reducing the negative impacts on the environment and on the welfare of the horses themselves. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Agonistic behaviours are often directed at other animals for self-defence or to increase distance from valued resources, such as food. Examples include aggression and counter-predator behaviours. Contemporary diets may boost the value of food as a resource and create unanticipated associations with the humans who deliver it. At the same time the domestic horse is asked to carry the weight of riders and perform manoeuvres that, ethologically, are out-of-context and may be associated with instances of pain, confusion, or fear. Agonistic responses can endanger personnel and conspecifics. They are traditionally grouped along with so-called vices as being undesirable and worthy of punishment; a response that can often make horses more dangerous. The current study used data from the validated online Equine Behavioural and Research Questionnaire (E-BARQ) to explore the agonistic behaviours (as reported by the owners) of 2734 horses. With a focus on ridden horses, the behaviours of interest in the current study ranged from biting and bite threats and kicking and kick threats to tail swishing as an accompaniment to signs of escalating irritation when horses are approached, prepared for ridden work, ridden, and hosed down (e.g., after work). Analysis of the responses according to the context in which they arise included a dendrographic analysis that identified five clusters of agonistic behaviours among certain groups of horses and a principal component analysis that revealed six components, strongly related to the five clusters. Taken together, these results highlight the prospect that the motivation to show these responses differs with context. The clusters with common characteristics were those observed in the context of: locomotion under saddle; saddling; reactions in a familiar environment, inter-specific threats, and intra-specific threats. These findings highlight the potential roles of fear and pain in such unwelcome responses and challenge the simplistic view that the problems lie with the nature of the horses themselves rather than historic or current management practices. Improved understanding of agonistic responses in horses will reduce the inclination of owners to label horses that show such context-specific responses as being generally aggressive. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The American Bashkir Curly Horse is frequently advertised to horse-allergic riders and claimed to be a so-called hypoallergenic breed that elicits fewer symptoms. Previous studies quantifying selected allergens in different breeds did not find a reduced allergen content in Curly Horses. Here, we provide a comprehensive proteomic analysis of horse hair extracts and a molecular analysis of the major allergen Equ c 1 with the aim of identifying differences in the Curly Horse breed that might explain their presumed reduced allergenic potential. Methods: Horse hair extracts were prepared from Curly and American Quarter Horse breeds, separated by gender and castration status, extracts from other breeds served as controls. Extracts and native Equ c 1 (nEqu c 1) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. IgE-binding capacities of nEqu c 1 and its recombinant variants were tested by ELISA using sera of patients sensitized to horses. Structures and ligand binding abilities were analyzed by computational modeling and fluorescence quenching assays. Results: All known respiratory horse allergens are present in hair extracts of Curly and Quarter Horses and share identical allergen-specific peptides. Lipocalin allergens are the most abundant proteins in horse hair extracts and contain several post-translational modifications. We identified two new variants of Equ c 1 that have similar IgE-binding capacities but show structural differences in their binding cavities and altered ligand binding behavior. There are no differences in IgE-binding of Equ c 1 derived from Curly Horses compared to other horse breeds. Conclusion: Our data do not support the claim that Curly Horses are less allergenic than other breeds. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Sport horse welfare is currently under scrutiny. Among other issues, it has been pointed out that behavioural signs of discomfort are frequently overlooked during training and competitions. Previous studies reported a relatively high prevalence of these types of behaviour (e.g., tail swishing, mouth opening – typically jointly labelled ‘conflict behaviour’) in elite level dressage and show jumping warmblood horses. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of conflict behaviour in Icelandic horses competing at elite level in breed-specific gait competitions. We used online video recordings from a competition in Iceland, including two different competitions (MD22, Fivegait F1: n = 25, and Loose-rein Tölt T2: n = 24 participating horses). The recordings were viewed at slow speed (x 0.25) enabling a detailed recording of the horses’ behavioural expressions. Mouth opening was the most frequently observed behaviour and occurred more in pace and tölt (Fivegait F1, P<0.001). In T2, mouth opening was more frequent in short-rein tölt than during loose-rein tölt (P<0.001). Sudden head movements, tail swishing and undesired gait changes also occurred, but less frequently. An elongated upper lip was observed in 12 of the 24 participating horses in T2, but only in short-rein tölt, suggesting that upper lip elongation is related to rein tension. We conclude that mouth movements (mouth opening and an elongated upper lip) are common behavioural expressions in Icelandic horses competing at elite level. Further studies are required to reveal the significance of these behaviours in terms of horse welfare. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This study systematically compared the performance of five corrosion-resistant electrode materials for electro-dewatering. Through a comprehensive analysis of dewatering efficiency, energy consumption, and corrosion resistance, conductive plastic composite electrodes (EKG) were selected as the optimal electrode material for experimentation. Additionally, the impact of electric field strength and electrode spacing on the efficiency and energy consumption of electro-dewatering (EDW) was investigated. The results showed that the increase in electric field intensity could improve the solid content and dewatering efficiency of the sediments, but the corresponding energy consumption also increased. The increased spacing of the plates reduced the dehydration effect and increased the energy consumption. By employing the Wild Horse Optimization algorithm, empirical and multifactorial response models for the dewatering solidification process were established, aimed at predicting the dewatering performance and energy consumption. The study concludes that for the remediation of heavy metals, the electric field strength should not exceed 10 V/cm to avoid excessive heavy metal migration and potential adverse chemical reactions. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The paper presents data on study of meat productivity horses Yakut breed. As a result, it was found that meat productivity of horses, including quality of meat products, largely depends on feed conditions. As result of research, it was found that animals from second and third groups exceeded first group in pre-slaughter weight by 3.29 and 2.99%, carcass weight by 4.42 and 3.38%, fat by 8.85 and 3.05%. The study of meat quality was carried out in terms of chemical composition and organoleptic characteristics. During analysis, it was found that meat samples of first group contained more moisture compared to second and third groups by 1.96 and 1.10%. At the same time, second and third groups exceeded the first group in protein by 1.43 and 0.73%, fat by 0.53 and 0.36%, P by 1.62 and 0.54%, Cu by 9.52 and 4.76%, Mg by 9.23 and 5.14%, Se by 3.57 and 1.79%, as well as vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2 and B3. The organoleptic evaluation of meat products found that all samples met quality requirements of the standard. Thus, analysis of the data showed that meat productivity of horses depends to a greater extent on feeding conditions. © 2024, Science and Innovation Center Publishing House. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there is a necessity for horses to be evaluated for kidney function as equine kidney disease is becoming an increasing problem. As we know, horses are often treated on everyday basis with drugs that can be nephrotoxic in some instances. This is why practitioners need to be familiar with different kidney biomarkers and their normal values in all horse age groups, as different age groups might have slight or significant differences in normal values. In this article we evaluate equine serum SDMA, which is becoming widely used and accepted in clinical practice as a biomarker for early detection of kidney injury. We evaluate its serum concentration in the geriatric group of horses in order to bring more insight into its use in this age group. © 2024 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Forestry.

ABSTRACT: Cadmium (Cd) pollution has become a global issue due to industrial and agricultural developments. However, the molecular mechanism of Cd-induced detrimental effects and relevant signal transduction/metabolic networks are largely unknown in marine fishes. Here, greenfin horse-faced filefish (Thamnaconus septentrionalis) were exposed to 5.0 mg/L Cd up to 7 days. We applied both biochemical methods and multi-omics techniques to investigate how the gills respond to Cd exposure. Our findings revealed that Cd exposure caused the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn activated the MAPK and apoptotic pathways to alleviate oxidative stress and cell damage. Glycolysis, protein degradation, as well as fatty acid metabolism might assist to meet the requirements of nutrition and energy under Cd stress. We also found that long-term (7 days, “long-term” means compared to 12 and 48 h) Cd exposure caused the accumulation of succinate, which would in turn trigger an inflammatory response and start an immunological process. Moreover, ferroptosis might induce inflammation. Overall, Cd exposure caused oxidative stress, energy metabolism disturbance, and immune response in greenfin horse-faced filefish. Our conclusions can be used as references for safety risk assessment of Cd to marine economic fishes. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Theileria equi is 1 of the emerging and prevailing tick-borne hemoprotozoans adversely affecting the equids worldwide, including Pakistan. The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and molecular characterization of T. equi in working horses (n = 194), the comparative efficacy of different diagnostic tests, associated risk factors, and hematobiochemical analysis. The blood samples of horses were subjected to microscopic examination, cELISA, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the results revealed a prevalence of 9.79, 21.13, and 13.40%, respectively, for T. equi in working horses. The comparison of microscopy and cELISA results with PCR showed that cELISA had higher sensitivity (84.62%), but lower specificity (88.69%) and accuracy (88.14%) in comparison to microscopy (57.69, 97.62, and 92.27%). Molecular characterization of T. equi by phylogenetic analysis revealed a 61% resemblance of study isolates with each other OL662926, OL662925, and 82% similarity with isolate OL662924 while also showing homology with T. equi isolates of South Africa, South Korea, India, Pakistan, and Brazil. The risk factor analysis revealed a significant association (P < 0.05) of tick control status, previous tick history, tick infestation, house hygiene, deworming/vaccination, and the presence of other livestock species with T. equi infection in horses. The hematobiochemical profile revealed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cells (WBCs), platelet (PLT), phosphorus, and an increase in lymphocytes, granulocytes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine in T. equi-infected horses. The current study is the first comprehensive report for comparative evaluation of microscopy, cELISA, and PCR, assessment of epidemiological risk factors as well as hematobiochemical variations due to T. equi infection in Pakistan. © American Society of Parasitologists 2024.

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness (AHS) is a non-contagious arthropod-borne infectious disease of Equidae. Because of its severity and quick spread, It is cosidered as a notifiable disease. The current study intended to look into the current suitation of the vector-borne African horse sickness virus (AHSV) in Egypt, determine viral seroprevelance, and assess the associated risk factors. In this context, 2739 sera and 150 spleen samples were collected from different Egyptian governorates and tested for AHSV screening. The sera were investigated for presence of antibodies against AHSV whilst spleen samples were tested for AHSV Ag and RNA detection. The obtained results revealed that all 2739 sera samples tested negative for AHSV antibodies. Furthermore, using ELISA and conventional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), to identify AHSV Ag and nucleic acid, the 150 tested spleen samples gave negative results with both assays. In conclusion, the recorded results indicated the absence of antibodies, antigen, and viral nucleic acid of AHSV in all tested samples which proved that there is no circulating virus in the investigated Egyptian governorates in the period from 2017 to 2022. Evenually, the effective control programs are recommended by carrying out further epidemiological investigations to understand the current situation of arboviruses in the country. © 2011-2024 Journal of Advanced Veterinary Research.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to describe clinical data associated with acorn intoxication and to find variables associated with survival. Data from horses presented at CISCO-ONIRIS from 2011 to 2018 with a diagnosis of acorn intoxication were included. Diagnosis was based on the following: season, the presence of acorns in the environment, clinical and hemato-biochemical parameters suggestive of a digestive/renal disease, the co-morbidity of companion animals, and post-mortem findings. Statistical analysis was completed using Student’s t-test for mean comparisons and a Chi-square test for group comparisons (p < 0.05). A total of 25 horses were included, and seasonality suggests that the intoxication may vary from year to year. Clinical signs associated with acorn intoxication were signs of circulatory shock (lethargy, tachycardia, abnormal mucous membrane, tachypnea), digestive signs (diarrhea, ileus, colic), and abnormal temperature. Clinical pathological findings included increased hematocrit, WBC, creatinine, BUN, GGT, AST, CK and decreased albumin. Overall, 44% (11/25) of horses survived. The majority (13/14) of non-survivors died, or were euthanized, during the first 48 h. Findings significantly associated with non-survival were age, heart rate, hemorrhagic diarrhea, ileus, hematocrit, creatinine, blood lactate, and thickness of the colon wall at ultrasonography. This study provides equine practitioners with valuable prognostic information in cases of acorn intoxication. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Ketoprofen is an anti-inflammatory drug that is commonly administered to racehorses for the alleviation of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation. This study represents a comprehensive examination of the metabolism (in vivo and in vitro), pharmacokinetics and ex vivo pharmacodynamics, of ketoprofen in horses. The in vitro metabolism as well as specific enzymes responsible for metabolism was determined by incubating liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 and UGT enzymes with ketoprofen. For the in vivo portion, 15 horses were administered a single intravenous dose of 2.2-mg/kg ketoprofen. Blood and urine samples were collected prior to and up to 120 h post-drug administration. Additional blood samples were collected at select time points and were stimulated with calcium ionophore or lipopolysaccharide, ex vivo, to induce eicosanoid production. Drug, metabolite, and eicosanoid concentrations were determined using LC–MS/MS. Incubation of ketoprofen with equine liver microsomes generated 3-hydroxy ketoprofen, an unidentified hydroxylated metabolite, and ketoprofen glucuronide. Recombinant equine CYP2C23 produced the greatest amount of hydroxylated ketoprofen and recombinant equine UGT1A2 generated ketoprofen glucuronide. Dihydro, 3-hydroxy, and glucuronide metabolites were identified in blood and urine samples. The Vdss was 0.280, 0.385, and 0.319 L/kg for total ketoprofen, S (+) ketoprofen, and R (−) ketoprofen, respectively. The mean half-life was 6.01 h for total ketoprofen, 2.22 h for S (+) ketoprofen, and 1.72 h for R (−) ketoprofen. Stimulation of ketoprofen-treated blood with lipopolysaccharide and calcium ionophore resulted in an inhibition of TXB2, PGE2, PGF2alpha, LTB4, and 15(s)-HETE production for up to 120 h post-drug administration. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Parasitic infections pose significant threats to humans’ and animals’ well-being worldwide. Among these parasites, Halicephalobus spp., a genus of nematodes, has gained attention due to its ability to cause severe infections in various animal species, including horses. Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Halicephalobus spp., specifically focusing on Halicephalobus gingivalis in horses. Materials and methods: In July 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted in northern Iran to determine the prevalence of Halicephalobus spp. Using standard coprological techniques, 141 fecal samples from randomly selected horses were analyzed for GI helminth eggs. The Halicephalobus spp. eggs present in faeces were identified by molecular methods. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the partial 5′ variable region (~ 390 base pairs) of 18 S DNA using SSUA_F and SSU22_R primers. Furthermore, the PCR products obtained were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was performed using available sequences from GenBank. Results: Microscopic examination of 141 fresh faecal samples revealed 5 fecal samples were infected with small ellipsoidal nematode eggs ranging between 40 and 50 × 50–60 μm. This study’s PCR amplicons showed ~ 390 bp bands on 2.0% agarose gel. A partial sequence of 18 S DNA (363 bp) was obtained herein (GenBank accession no. OQ843456). Conclusion: Overall, using molecular tools represents a significant step forward in diagnosing and managing the Halicephalobus gingivalis infections in horses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Analgesic protocols related to orchiectomy or castration of young horses vary widely depending on geographic location, educational background of the veterinarian, and other demographic factors. Specific practices of equine veterinarians in the United States (US) have not been reported. Objectives: To determine perioperative pain management practices of equine veterinarians in the United States as they relate to castration of healthy yearling colts. Study design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: An internet-based questionnaire included items related to analgesic drugs used in association with castration of healthy yearling colts. Demographic, educational, and experiential factors associated with routine recommendation of analgesic medications after castration were analysed with calculation of odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Responses from 146 equine veterinarians in the United States revealed that 112/146 (76.7%) administered a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) at the time of castration, and 107/143 respondents (73.3%) recommended administration of NSAIDs for a median of 3 days (IQR = 3–5) after surgery. Veterinarians who recommended NSAID analgesia after castration provided a higher pain severity score for horses at 24 h after a routine castration. Routine recommendation of post-castration NSAID analgesia was associated with veterinarians who were employed in a multi-veterinarian practice (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2–6.1) and completed their veterinary education in the year 2000 or more recently (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1–5.9). Main limitations: Possible distribution, self-selection, and response biases as a result of convenience sampling methodology and possible recall bias of respondents. Conclusions: Perioperative pain management practices vary widely among US veterinarians but the majority of veterinarians, especially more recent graduates and those in multi-veterinarian practices, recommend administration of an NSAID at the time of castration and for a median of 3 days after surgery. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Corticosteroids are a commonly used, inexpensive intra-articular treatment for osteoarthritis which may increase the risk for laminitis in horses due, in part, to hyperinsulinaemia. Humans with metabolic syndrome experience increases in insulin and glucose concentrations post-injection, but responses in horses are unknown. Objectives: To determine the effect of a single intra-articular (IA) dose of triamcinolone acetate (TA) on blood insulin and glucose concentrations. Study design: Before-after study. Methods: Ten horses with normal insulin regulation as assessed by an oral sugar test received 18 mg of TA into one middle carpal joint. Insulin and glucose concentrations were evaluated at baseline and 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h following IA corticosteroid injection. Differences from baseline were evaluated using a repeated measures ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison testing or a Friedman test with Dunn's correction (significant at p < 0.05). Results: Mean ± SD blood insulin concentration post IA TA injection was increased at 6 h (15.8 ± 3.1 μIU/mL, p = 0.01), 24 h (23 ± 5.8 μIU/mL, p ≤ 0.001), and 48 h (29 ± 13 μIU/mL, p ≤ 0.01) compared to baseline (10 ± 12.3 μIU/mL), with the peak at 48 h. Median ± 95% CI blood glucose concentration post IA TA injection was increased at 6 h (112.7 ± 20.3 mg/dL, p = 0.006), 8 h (112.9 ± 21.4 mg/dL, p = 0.004), 24 h (122.6 ± 14.6, p ≤ 0.0001), and 48 h (123.5 ± 15.4 mg/dL, p ≤ 0.0001) compared to baseline (89.2 ± 6.6 mg/dL), with the peak at 48 h. Main limitations: Only horses with normal insulin regulation were evaluated. Conclusions: Blood insulin and glucose concentrations modestly increased for 48 h following IA TA. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Fungal detection in equine airways may be performed on either tracheal wash (TW) or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by either cytology or culture. However, method comparisons are sparse. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of fungi in airways of horses according to the sample site and laboratory methodology. Sixty-two adult horses, investigated in the field or referred for respiratory disease, were included. Tracheal wash, and BALF collected separately from both lungs, were collected using a videoendoscope. Fungi were detected in cytologic samples examined by light microscopy, and by fungal culture. Hay was sampled in the field. Prevalence of fungi was of 91.9% in TW and 37.1% in BALF. Fungi were cultured from 82.3% of TW and 20.9% of BALF. Fungal elements were observed cytologically in 69.4% of TW and 22.6% of BALF. In 50% of horses, the same fungi were detected in both TW and hay, but fungi detected in BALF and hay differed in all horses. Poor agreement was found for the detection of fungi between TW and BALF and between fungal culture and cytologic examination (Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) < 0.20). Moderate agreement was found between cytologic examination of left and right lungs (κ = 0.47). The prevalence of fungi detected cytologically on pooled BALF was significantly different (p = 0.023) than on combined left and right BALF. Fungi were more prevalent in the TW than BALF, and results suggest that hay might not be the primary source of fungi of the lower respiratory tract of horses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: β-glucan is part of the cell wall of fungi and yeasts and has been known for decades to have immunomodulating effects on boosting immunity against various infections as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that is able to modify biological responses. β-glucan has been used in rat models and in vitro studies involving sepsis and SIRS with good results, but this supplement has not been evaluated in the treatment of endotoxemia in horses. This study aims to evaluate the effects of preventive supplementation with β-glucan in horses submitted to endotoxemia by means of inflammatory response modulation. Eight healthy horses, both male and female, aged 18 ± 3 months, weighing 300 ± 100 kg of mixed breed, were randomly assigned to two groups of four animals, both of which were subjected to the induction of endotoxemia via the intravenous administration of E. coli lipopolysaccharides (0.1 µg/kg). For 30 days before the induction of endotoxemia, horses in the β-glucan group (GB) received 10 mg/kg/day of β-glucan orally, and horses in the control group (GC) received 10 mg/kg/day of 0.9% sodium chloride orally. The horses were submitted to physical exams, including a hematological, serum biochemistry, and peritoneal fluid evaluation, and the serum quantification of cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. For statistical analysis, the normality of residues and homogeneity of variances were verified; then, the variables were analyzed as repeated measures over time, checking the effect of treatment, time, and the interaction between time and treatment. Finally, the averages were compared using Tukey’s test at a significance level of 5%. Horses from both experimental groups presented clinical signs and hematological changes in endotoxemia, including an increase in heart rate and body temperature, neutrophilic leukopenia, an increase in serum bilirubin, glucose, lactate, and an increase in TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. Hepatic and renal function were not compromised by β-glucan supplementation. GB presented higher mean values of the serum total protein, globulins, and IL-8 compared to that observed in GC. In the peritoneal fluid, horses from GB presented a lower mean concentration of neutrophils and a higher mean concentration of macrophages compared to the GC. It was concluded that preventive supplementation of β-glucan for thirty days modulated the immune response, as evidenced by increasing serum total proteins, globulins, IL-8, and changes in the type of peritoneal inflammatory cells, without effectively attenuating clinical signs of endotoxemia in horses. Considering the safety of β-glucan in this study, the results suggest the potential clinical implication of β-glucan for prophylactic use in horse endotoxemia. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: To optimise the performance and welfare of horses during equestrian competitions in hot climates, it is advised to acclimate them to the heat. The effects of training in a heated indoor arena were studied. Four Olympic horses (13.3 ± 2.2 years; three eventers, one para-dressage horse) were trained for 14 consecutive days in a heated indoor arena (32 ± 1 °C; 50–60% humidity) following their normal training schedule in preparation for the Tokyo Olympic games. Standardised exercise tests (SETs) were performed on Day 1 and Day 14, measuring heart rate (HR; bpm), plasma lactate concentration (LA; mmol/L), deep rectal temperature (Trec; °C), sweat loss (SL; L), and sweat composition (K+, Cl− and Na+ concentration). The data were analysed using linear mixed models. The Trec and HR were significantly decreased after acclimation (estimate: −0.106, 95% CI −0.134, −0.078; estimate: −4.067, 95% CI −7.535, −0.598, respectively). Furthermore, for all the horses, the time taken to reach their peak Trec and heat storage increased, while their LA concentrations decreased. The SL, Cl−, and Na+ concentrations decreased in three out of the four horses. Conclusions: Fourteen days of normal training in a heated indoor arena resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular and thermal strain. This is advantageous because it shows that elite sport horses can be acclimated while training as usual for a championship. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To measure the trunk vertical displacement (VD) in horses trotting on a water treadmill (WT) at different water depths (WDs) and speeds. ANIMALS 6 sound Standardbred horses (median age 12 years [IQR:10.5-12]). METHODS The horses were trotted on a WT at 2 speeds (3.5 m/s and 5 m/s) and during 4 conditions: dry treadmill (DT), WD at mid-cannon (WD-CAN), mid-radius (WD-RAD), and shoulder (WD-SHOUL). The dorsoventral movement was obtained with accelerometers placed over the withers, thoracolumbar junction (T18), tuber sacrale (TS), and sacrum (S5). The VD was defined with the median value of the upward (Up) and downward (Down) amplitudes of the vertical excursion during each stride. The difference of VD at each sensor location was compared between the DT and the 3 WDs, and between the 2 trotting speeds for the same condition. RESULTS The VD amplitudes were significantly increased at any sensor location when trotting in water at WD-CAN and WD-RAD compared to DT (P <.05 for all), with the highest increase at WD-RAD and T18. When the speed increased from 3.5 to 5 m/s, the VD amplitudes were significantly decreased at T18 at each water level (P =.03), and at WD-RAD only for the withers and TS (P =.03). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Both water depth and speed affect the trunk VD in horses at trot on a WT with an opposite effect. The VD increases when increasing the WD up to mid-radius, while the VD decreases when increasing the trotting speed, with the main effects observed at the thoracolumbar junction. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: A single dose of metformin administered 1 h prior to oral glucose challenge was previously shown to reduce insulinaemic responses in horses with experimentally-induced insulin dysregulation (ID). Targeted administration could be useful for controlling post-prandial hyperinsulinaemia in horses with naturally-occurring ID. Objectives: The objective was to compare the insulinaemic and glycaemic responses to oral sugar testing (OST) performed at different intervals after a single dose of metformin in horses with naturally-occurring ID. We hypothesised that pre-treatment with one dose of metformin would significantly decrease the insulinaemic response to OST. Study design: Randomised cross-over in vivo experiment. Methods: Eight university-owned adult horses with naturally-occurring ID underwent OST 1, 2 and 6 h following a single oral dose of metformin (30 mg/kg) or 1 h after placebo (240 mL water) with a 7-day washout between treatments over a period of 3 weeks. Plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucose concentrations were measured at 0, 60 and 90 min after 0.45 mL/kg light corn syrup and the effect of treatment (and the interval since dosing) examined using a mixed effects linear regression model. Results: Metformin treatment had no significant effect on plasma glucose, insulin or C-peptide concentrations at any time point compared with placebo (p > 0.05). For OST 1 h post metformin, median (IQR) plasma insulin was 91.3 (62.4–114.9) μIU/mL at 60 min versus 76.2 (59.1–134.5) for placebo (p = 0.8) and 62.7 (31.4–109.7) at 90 min versus 51.8 (29.2–126.3) for placebo (p = 0.9). Main limitations: Small sample size may limit identification of more subtle decreases in insulin concentration with metformin pre-dosing. The results of this study are relevant only for one pre-treatment dose (30 mg/kg) which limits extrapolation to predictions about the effects of longer-term metformin administration on insulin and glucose dynamics in the horse. Conclusions and clinical importance: The results do not support the use of targeted metformin treatment to reduce post-prandial hyperinsulinaemia in horses with naturally-occurring ID. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Algeria is a typical country of great and ancestral equestrian tradition where horses are a varied asset in terms of animal genetic resources, offering an important diversity of breeds in terms of their adaptation and their capacity for production in their natural environment. This literature review aims to illustrate the role played by the horse in Algerian culture and traditions from the past to the present and, to present main diseases studied throughout the country. The equine industry occupies a prominent place in the history and economy of North Africa, especially in Algeria, horse has a major role in sustainable development, particularly in the environmental field, by playing a particular role in the management of spaces and landscapes beneficial to the maintenance and development of biodiversity, but also in its relationship with humans. Especially in the Center and West of the country, horses are the main actors of "Fantasia", which ensures the continuity of an authentic military equestrian tradition, it is a simulation of traditional military action. According to the prevalence rates, the main diseases threatening horses’ health are Equine Influenza, West Nile Virus, Equine Viral Arteritis, Equine granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Toxoplasmosis, Microsporidiosis and Pinworms. However, low rates were observed for Rhinopneumonitis, Brucellosis, Surra and Cryptosporidiosis. Actually, horses deserve more attention from public authorities and civil society, to preserve this animal considered as a part of the national and humanitarian heritage. © CAB International 2024.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a complex and somewhat unpredictable phenomenon. Historically, the utilization of avoparcin in intensive farming during the latter part of the previous century led to the development of resistance to vancomycin, a crucial antibiotic in human medicine with life-saving properties. Currently, in the European Union, there is a growing reliance on the ionophore antibiotic monensin (MON), which acts both as a coccidiostat in poultry farming and as a preventative measure against ketosis in lactating cows. Although many researchers claim that MON does not induce cross-resistance to antibiotics of clinical relevance in human medicine, some conflicting reports exist. The numerous applications of MON in livestock farming and the consequent dissemination of the compound and its metabolites in the environment require further investigation to definitively ascertain whether MON represents a potential vector for the propagation of AMR. It is imperative to emphasize that antibiotics cannot substitute sound animal husbandry practices or tailored dietary regimens in line with the different production cycles of livestock. Consequently, a rigorous evaluation is indispensable to assess whether the economic benefits associated with MON usage justify its employment, also considering its local and global environmental ramifications and the potential risk of instigating AMR with increased costs for its control. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Blindfolds have commonly been suggested to make horses more tractable in emergency or high-stress situations such as barn fire evacuations or trailer loading. However, little research has been done on the veracity of this claim. Two studies were conducted to examine the impact of blindfolds on ease of handling. In Study 1, 33 riding lesson horses were led from a familiar stall both blindfolded and unblindfolded. In Study 2, 27 of these horses were then led through an obstacle course both blindfolded and unblindfolded that required them to weave through cones, back up through a chute, walk across a tarp and pass through a gate made of pool noodles that brushed their flanks. For both studies, time taken to complete each phase of the test (Study 1: haltering, blindfolding, exiting stall; Study 2: each of the four obstacles) was recorded, as well as heart rate difference from baseline, lead rope pressure and frequency of avoidant or resistant behaviours. Results were analyzed using a mixed model with post-hoc Tukey-Kramer comparisons to investigate the relationship between variables. Generally, blindfolded horses required more time and greater lead rope pressure for handling and displayed higher frequencies of avoidant (p < 0.05) and active refusal behaviour (p < 0.04) in Study 1 and for the cones and backing up obstacles in Study 2. Conversely, when navigating the visually frightening “gate” obstacle in Study 2, blindfolded horses required less time (p = 0.0053) and lead rope pressure (p = 0.0049) and demonstrated fewer avoidant (p < 0.0001) or refusal behaviours (p = 0.0009) than unblindfolded horses. Blindfolded horses showed a greater heart rate increase from baseline while being led in Study 1 (p = 0.0226). Blindfolding did not have an effect on heart rate in Study 2 (p = 0.1672), but horses demonstrated reduced heart rate difference from baseline during their second attempt at the obstacle course regardless of blindfolding status (p < 0.0001). These findings suggest that blindfolding may be a beneficial tool when navigating visually frightening stimuli and time is not a concern. However, in emergency scenarios such as barn fire evacuations, blindfolding is likely to increase lead time and difficulty of handling, which could negatively impact the success of a rescue and put human and animal lives at risk. Future research is required to test the efficacy of blindfolds in a more realistically simulated emergency environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the discrepancies between genetic and visual coat color assignment in the Sarcidano Horse and to elucidate potential reasons. Individual DNA from 90 Sarcidano Horses was used for genetic assignment of coat color to explore the correspondence with individual forms containing phenotypical traits. The MC1R exon 1 and ASIP exon 3 have been genotyped and sequenced to obtain a picture of the coat color distribution in this breed. Surprisingly, once we compared the genetic results with the individual forms reporting the phenotypic data for each subject, a certain degree of non-correspondence between the phenotypic and genetic data in relation to coat color emerged. From the genetic analysis, Chestnuts (n = 58) resulted the most common Sarcidano Horse (n = 58), followed by a quite large number of Blacks (n = 28) and a very small number of Bays (n = 4), whereas phenotypic distribution resulted in 38 Chestnuts, 40 Bays, only 2 Blacks, and 10 Grays (without the possibility of recognizing the true color they carried). Chestnut resulted a very representative coat color, while many horses that visually identified as Bays were genetically Blacks. This discrepancy, that could be due to a variety of individual and external factors, including age, time of year, living situation and dietary condition, suggesting the importance of accurate coat color identification to ensure adequate features registration and reliable prediction of offspring’s coat color. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Enterotomy of the pelvic flexure is commonly performed during colic surgery in the horse to empty the large colon of its contents. A two-layer closure with absorbable suture material is recommended, but a consensus has not been established. Many different techniques have been described and tested to evaluate surgical time, luminal diameter reduction, bursting pressure and post-operative complications including adhesion formation. The results of these studies vary within and between enterotomy techniques. The objective of this narrative review was to evaluate and summarise relevant published literature on pelvic flexure enterotomy techniques in the horse. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of instilling extract of the pitcher plant around the palmar digital nerves of horses to ameliorate digit pain causing lameness. Five mixed breed horses were recruited. Horses were determined to be lame because of pain in the distal portion of one or both thoracic limbs by a positive response to a basisesamoid nerve block using 2%^mepivacaine hydrochloride. Gait was evaluated pre- and post-nerve block at 30 min, 3, 7,14 and 21 days. At the 3-week evaluation, the basisesamoid nerve block was repeated using the extract, and the gait was evaluated at similar times. Lameness was evaluated objectively using a wireless, inertial, sensor-based, motion analysis system. The basisesamoid nerve block significantly ameliorated lameness at 30 min when gait was evaluated, but it had no significant effect on lameness after this time. The product containing extract of the pitcher plant had no significant effect on lameness when administered as a basisesamoid nerve block at any time. Extract of the pitcher plant administered adjacent to the medial and lateral palmar digital nerves (i.e., a basisesamoid nerve block) had no efficacy in ameliorating lameness in the distal portion of one or both thoracic limbs. Extract of the pitcher plant likely has no value for treating horses for chronic pain when administered as a regional nerve block. © 2023

ABSTRACT: This is a clinical case report describing the surgical correction of a penis retroverted through a scrotal castration site fistula of at least 4 months duration. The penile retroversion was not observed in the immediate post-operative period or for the first 2 months of ownership by the owner. Surgical correction involved breaking down adhesions, replacing the penis into its proper anatomic position and debriding and closing the scrotal fistula. The gelding was discharged 1 day post-operatively without any complications. Follow-up communication with the owner revealed no apparent concerns with surgical site healing or abnormalities in ability to urinate long-term. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Tibial perineural analgesia has often been reported to fail to achieve nerve desensitisation in horses. Ultrasound-guided (US-guided) techniques have recently been described to improve tibial perineural desensitisation. Objectives: To compare US-guided and ‘blind’ tibial perineural analgesia techniques in lameness investigation. Study design: Randomised clinical trial. Methods: Horses presenting for lameness investigation, which required tibial perineural analgesia, were randomly assigned either to a US-guided or blind injection group. The efficacy of perineural analgesia was assessed by testing the loss of skin sensation at the medial and lateral heel bulbs. Skin sensation was assessed, prior to injection and then at four intervals post-injection (10–15, 20–25, 30–35 and 40–45 min) using a hand-held digital algometer with a 1 mm diameter pin; a value of 25 N was defined as indicative of skin desensitisation. The time taken to perform each injection technique and any adverse reactions were recorded. Summary statistics were performed to examine differences between groups. The frequency of skin desensitisation was compared between groups using a Fisher's exact test and the length of time taken to perform injections was compared using a Mann–Whitney U test. Results: Sixteen US-guided and 11 blind injections were included in the study. All cases undergoing US-guided injection lost skin sensation, whereas this occurred in only one case receiving the blind injection. The US-guided group had a significantly higher probability of skin sensation loss (p < 0.001), although the injection technique took significantly longer to complete compared to the blind group (p < 0.001). No adverse reactions were noted with either perineural injection technique. Main limitations: Limited number of cases for each injection group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that US-guided tibial perineural injection is more likely to result in adequate and prompt tibial perineural analgesia compared to the blind injection technique, although it takes longer to complete. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A two-year-old Arabian horse presented for abnormal external genitalia and dangerous stallion-like behavior was diagnosed with disorder of sexual development (DSD), also known as intersex/hermaphroditism. Standing 1-stage surgical procedure performed under sedation, and local anesthesia to concurrently eliminate stallion-like behavior, risk of neoplastic transformation of intraabdominal gonads, and to replace ambiguous external genital with a functional, and cosmetically more acceptable anatomy. Step-1) Laparoscopic abdominal exploration and gonadectomy; Step-2) Rudimentary penis resection and perineal urethrostomy. The horse tolerated surgery well (combined surgery time 185 min) with no complications. At macroscopic examination of the gonads, they resembled hypoplastic testis-like tissues. Microscopic examination confirmed presence of seminiferous tubules, Leydig and Sertoli/granulosa cells. Cytogenetic evaluation revealed a 64,XX karyotype, SRY-negative. The stallion-like behavior subsided within days post-operatively. Long-term follow-up revealed the genitoplasty site healed without urine scalding or urethral stricture. The owner satisfaction was excellent and the horse could be used post-surgery as an athlete. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Active glucagon-like peptide-1 (aGLP-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of equine insulin dysregulation (ID), but its role is unclear. Cleavage of proglucagon (coded by the GCG gene) produces aGLP-1 in enteral L cells. Objectives: The aim in vivo was to examine the sequence of the exons of GCG in horses with and without ID, where aGLP-1 was higher in the group with ID. The aims in vitro were to identify and quantify the expression of GCG in the equine intestine (as a marker of L cells) and determine intestinal secretion of aGLP-1. Study design: Genomic studies were case–control studies. Expression and secretion studies in vitro were cross-sectional. Methods: The GCG gene sequence of the exons was determined using a hybridisation capture protocol. Expression and quantification of GCG in samples of stomach duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and ascending and descending colon was achieved with droplet digital PCR. For secretory studies tissue explants were incubated with 12 mM glucose and aGLP-1 secretion was measured with an ELISA. Results: Although the median [IQR] post-prandial aGLP-1 concentrations were higher (p = 0.03) in animals with ID (10.2 [8.79–15.5]), compared with healthy animals (8.47 [6.12–11.7]), there was 100% pairwise identity of the exons of the GCG sequence for the cohort. The mRNA concentrations of GCG and secretion of aGLP-1 differed (p < 0.001) throughout the intestine. Main limitations: Only the exons of the GCG gene were sequenced and breeds were not compared. The horses used for the study in vitro were not assessed for ID and different horses were used for the small, and large, intestinal studies. Conclusions: Differences in post-prandial aGLP-1 concentration were not due to a variant in the exons of the GCG gene sequence in this cohort. Both the large and small intestine are sites of GLP-1 secretion. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Equestrian sports require precise animal welfare and health evaluations. To test the hypothesis that horses maintain their welfare when subjected to two three-barrel (3TB) races with 2 min intervals, an experiment was designed to evaluate their surface temperature using infrared thermography (IRT) in regions of interest (barrel, flank, neck, jaw, corner of the mouth, and ocular caruncle) and also measure blood biomarkers (hemogram, total plasma protein, fibrinogen, urea, creatinine, GGT, CK, cortisol, IL-6, and IL-1β). Ten Quarter Horses were monitored through thermography (pre-race, +1, +4, and +24 h post-race) and blood sampling (pre-race, +1, +4, and +24 h post-race). ANOVA and Tukey test at 5% were used. IRT in six regions of interest (Left/Right—barrel, flank, neck muscles) increased at +, with no differences between values recorded at +1 and +4 when compared to those measured pre-race (p > 0.05). Plasma protein, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (p < 0.05) increased immediately after the races, with recovery at +1 h. Other biomarkers did not change, including cortisol, IL-6, and IL-1β (p > 0.05). Results indicate that well-conditioned 3TB horses subjected to two races at short intervals do not show changes that could be related to impaired health or welfare. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: People spent more time at home as part of the precaution taken after the COVID-19 pandemic. In this stage, human beings began to own more pets and spend more time with them. One of the most significant questions during this period was whether COVID-19 could be transmitted to pets. Beta coronavirus was already known in the veterinary field to cause diseases with different pathogenicity in many animal species. Over time, research has shown that the disease can be transmitted to pets and wild animals. Many studies have shown that equines could be infected with this disease. This study serologically investigated whether COVID-19 was transmitted to horses from humans. Materials, Methods & Results: In this cohort study, 510 horse serums were collected from Canakkale (n = 80), Istanbul (n = 200), Tekirdag (n = 75), and Kirklareli (n = 155), provinces in the Thrace region of Turkey. The sampling was conducted in October and December 2021, when the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The samples were grouped as 0-1, 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15 ages. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates were coated with the whole inactive SARS-CoV-2 virus at five μg/ml. Hyperimmunized horse sera was used as a positive control, and newborn foal serums that did not drink colostrum were used as a negative control. Positive and negative control sera were also tested by virus neutralization assay (VNA). Primary and secondary serum dilution was determined using the checkerboard method. Accordingly, the test serum dilution was 1/12,800, and the secondary antibody dilution was 1/2,500. The classical indirect ELISA steps were followed. Horses, 192 (37.6%) were bred in riding clubs, and 318 (62.4%) were bred in individual barns. OD values ranged between 0.05-1.39. The cut-off value prepared by ROC analysis with 100% sensitivity, 99.78% specificity, and 95% confidence interval was defined as the OD 0.78 limit value in determining positivity. In this study, 60 (11.76%) horses tested serologically positive for SARS-CoV-2. The highest infection rates were in Istanbul (13%) and Kirklareli (13.3%), and the lowest were in Canakkale (8.75%). According to the chi-square test, there was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between cities (P > 0.05). It was determined that horses in the 6-10 age group and in riding schools had a statistically higher rate of contracting the disease than horses in other age groups and barn (P < 0.05). The infection rate was found to be very low in horses younger than 1-year-old and close to 15-year-old. Discussion: The infection was more intense in the 1-10 age group and riding clubs. The lower incidence of disease was seen in old and young horses because of their lack of use in equestrian activities. According to the results of this study, 11.76% of 510 horses were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. As a result of another study conducted on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 587 racehorses with a single or several fixed riders, it was reported that 5.9% was positive. In this respect, the results were found to be compatible. The SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate in cats and dogs has been reported as 4-43.8% and 3.4-23.5%, respectively. It was thought that the lower infection rate in horses as pets compared to dogs was related to the fact that horse riding was done outdoors, and COVID-19-positive individuals were prohibited from going out to do these activities in the acute period and rested at home during the shedding period. Compared to this study and other studies, it has been determined that the infection in horses is silent and has a short viremia period, and this related seropositivity can be detected. Sick humans should be more careful about zooanthropozoonosis diseases that can be transmitted from humans to horses. © 2024 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The study aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of tapentadol in horses, by determining plasma serotonin concentration and adrenocortical response, as biomarkers of pain stress in chronic joint disorders. Thirty-six horses (20 females and 16 males) were divided into three groups of 12 subjects each: group A, osteoarthritis (OA), grade 3–4 lameness; group B, OA, grade 5 lameness; and group C, no OA, no lameness, were enrolled. The orthopedic examination included flexion tests, and radiological and ultrasound examinations. The degree of lameness has been estimated from 0 to 5 according to the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEPs). Heart and respiratory rates (HR and RR) and blood pressure were recorded. Serotonin concentration and circulating cortisol levels were determined at baseline and the end of every week for 4 weeks. Biochemical parameters were recorded at baseline and the end of treatment with tapentadol. Subjects with OA were treated with tapentadol 0.5 mg kg−1. The response to painful stimulus on flexion tests was evaluated using the modified numeric pain rating scale (modified NRS 0–7) from baseline and the cumulative pain score (CPS 0–4) after the first week of treatment with tapentadol. The lameness decreased throughout the timeline in both groups (score from 3–4 to 1 in group A and score from 5 to 1 in group B) (p < 0.05). The NRS score decreased throughout the timeline (p < 0.05), from mild pain to no pain in group A (score 1–3 to 0) and from moderate pain to no pain in group B (score from 4 to 0). Physiological variables remained within the physiological range throughout the timeline. Cumulative pain scores ranged from 0.5 to 4 in group A and 1.5 to 7 in group B (p = 0.008). Serotonin concentrations remained unchanged throughout the timeline in all groups (p = 1.000) but in the OA groups, the concentrations were lower than control (p < 0.001). Circulating cortisol levels were reduced compared to baseline in subjects treated with tapentadol (p < 0.001). Tapentadol is effective in OA pain management in horses. Serotonin and cortisol may be utilized as biomarkers in the pain stress response. Serotonin can also determine the state of wellbeing of patients.

ABSTRACT: Hypertension and diabetes are diseases that interrelate which can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and one way to combat this issue is to reduce sodium intake. Raw horse gram has demonstrated comparable antioxidative and antidiabetic properties with soybean-fermented products which led to the utilization of horse gram to produce a fermented reduced-sodium functional food. Horse gram was fermented with Aspergillus oryzae, and a total of 5 samples containing sodium contents of 9% to 10.5% with a control of 11.7% were prepared. Next, sensory testing was conducted, and the most accepted sample was used for comparison with raw horse gram to determine changes in total phenolic content, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activity. A comparison of the fermented sample with raw horse gram observed that there was an improvement in polyphenol content, ABTS, DPPH activity, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase inhibition activity. The sensory results showed that Sample 1 with 10.5% sodium content had the highest acceptance and overall liking score above 5, suggesting that consumers can accept the sodium reduction. Raw horse gram exhibited good health properties which were enhanced by fermentation processing, and consumers were able to accept a reduced sodium product which encourages further analysis of other health benefits that horse gram can provide and development of other food products. © 2024 by authors, all rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A 25-year-old Irish sport horse was presented for investigation of a 7-day history of apathy and lethargy. Clinical examination revealed tachycardia, tachypnoea, distended, pulsating jugular veins and ventral oedema. Serum biochemistry showed azotaemia. The ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and the thorax revealed peritoneal, pleural and pericardial effusion. Following the assessment, the mare was euthanised and a full post-mortem examination was performed. The main findings included a ruptured mass in the left atrium of the heart with subsequent haemopericardium. By histological examination and immunoreactivity for thyroglobulin-1, the cardiac mass could be further classified as a thyroid carcinoma. As there was no evidence of thyroid neoplasia in the rest of the carcass, it is likely that the neoplasia originated from ectopic thyroid tissue in the heart. Additional findings included multiple intestinal haemangiomas and perianal melanomas. The case report indicates that cardiac thyroid carcinoma may be a possible differential diagnosis in horses diagnosed with congestive heart failure. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Essential oil of brown color was obtained by hydro-distillation from fresh flowers of horse chestnut. All major components of the corresponding oils were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The microorganisms most sensitive to the studied essential oil of flowers were revealed: Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Bacillus subtilis. Extensive documentation on the antimicrobial properties of essential oils and their constituents has been carried out by several workers. Although the mechanism of action of a few essential oil components has been elucidated in many pioneering works in the past, detailed knowledge of most of the compounds and their mechanism of action is still lacking. This knowledge is particularly important for the determination of the effect of essential oils on different microorganisms, how they work in combination with other antimicrobial compounds, and their interaction with food matrix components. Also, recent studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with essential oils have significant antimicrobial potential against multidrug- resistant pathogens due to an increase in chemical stability and solubility, decreased rapid evaporation and minimized degradation of active essential oil components. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: As the most promising strategy for cancer treatment, immunotherapy has attracted much attention, but its treatment effect is still blocked by the deficient immune response efficiency. In light of the significant role of mitochondria in cell metabolism, it has been considered to be a promising target to amplify immune response. In this report, a mitochondria-targeted nanodrug (UCNP@COF@FeCO/TPP@CM, UCFT@CM), camouflaged by cancer cell membrane (CM), was designed to realize cascade target and enhance immune response, further achieving the synergistic therapy of photodynamic therapy (PDT), CO gas therapy and immunotherapy. With the assistance of CM, the nanodrug exhibited significant enhancement on homologous targeting. After endocytosis, UCFT@CM would accumulate in mitochondria and realize controlled release of CO and enhanced PDT relying on the characteristics of mitochondria, further leading to serious mitochondrial oxidative stress and amplified immunotherapy. In addition, we verified that a new immune signal related to mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), is strongly associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD). Taken together, the sequenced targeting treatment makes full use of characteristics of mitochondria and provides a new approach for precisely targeting organelle to enhance the immune response. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A descriptive case series of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of eight horses presenting to a UK equine veterinary hospital with suspected idiopathic peripheral vestibular syndrome over a 7-year period (2014–2021). Idiopathic vestibular syndrome in the horse causes unilateral clinical signs including; ataxia, nystagmus, strabismus and a head tilt. Diagnosis is aided by neurological examination, endoscopy of the upper airway and cross-sectional imaging (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography). This case series indicates that horses with this condition can make a full recovery with return to ridden exercise. Treatment with anti-inflammatory medication did not appear to influence outcome. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Traits such as shape, size, and color often influence the economic and sentimental value of a horse. Around the world, horses are bred and prized for the colors and markings that make their unique coat patterns stand out from the crowd. The underlying genetic mechanisms determining the color of a horse’s coat can vary greatly in their complexity. For example, only two genetic markers are used to determine a horse’s base coat color, whereas over 50 genetic variations have been discovered to cause white patterning in horses. Some of these white-causing mutations are benign and beautiful, while others have a notable impact on horse health. Negative effects range from slightly more innocuous defects, like deafness, to more pernicious defects, such as the lethal developmental defect incurred when a horse inherits two copies of the Lethal White Overo allele. In this review, we explore, in detail, the etiology of white spotting and its overall effect on the domestic horse to Spot the Pattern of these beautiful (and sometimes dangerous) white mutations. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The influence of a horse’s appearance on health, sentimental and monetary value has driven the desire to understand the etiology of coat color. White markings on the coat define inclusion for multiple horse breeds, but they may disqualify a horse from registration in other breeds. In domesticated horses (Equus caballus), 35 KIT alleles are associated with or cause depigmentation and white spotting. It is a common misconception among the general public that a horse can possess only two KIT variants. To correct this misconception, we used BEAGLE 5.4-phased NGS data to identify 15 haplotypes possessing two or more KIT variants previously associated with depigmentation phenotypes. We sourced photos for 161 horses comprising 12 compound genotypes with three or more KIT variants and employed a standardized method to grade depigmentation, yielding average white scores for each unique compound genotype. We found that 7 of the 12 multi-variant haplotypes resulted in significantly more depigmentation relative to the single-variant haplotypes (ANOVA). It is clear horses can possess more than two KIT variants, and future work aims to document phenotypic variations for each compound genotype. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study evaluated tear film (TF) interferometry on horses examined in Northern Italy in 2019-2021. The objectives were to evaluate horses affected by keratitis, and to describe TF values in horses with no evidence of ocular disease. All horses received a complete ophthalmic examination and were examined with the Ocular Surface Analyser, Veterinary-setting, prior to eye manipulation, staining and sample collection. Eighteen horses with no evidence of ocular disease were included in the comparison group. Additionally, 46 horses displaying signs of keratitis (neovascularization, corneal opacities, ulceration, epithelial and subepithelial infiltrates) were evaluated. These horses were divided into presumed non-infectious and infectious or presumed infectious keratitis groups (one with proven bacterial origin, and the others with diagnosed or presumptive keratomycosis) with the former including immune-mediated keratitis. From the observations of TF interferometry in the comparison population the authors concluded that for non-invasive break-up time (NIBUT), the estimated preliminary reference interval was 10.4-31.2s, and for tear meniscus height (TMH), it was 0.215-0.457mm. Moreover, within the keratitis population, from an interferometric point of view punctate lesions of the ocular surface were present in all cases of active diagnosed or presumptive subepithelial keratomycosis but not in any of the non-infectious cases, either non-ulcerative or ulcerative. Limitations of the study include a relatively low number of horses examined and the fact that the diagnosis of infectious keratitis was presumptive and based on clinical improvement after treatment in some cases. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of TF interferometry performed in horses. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Stressful factors, including physical exercise, can influence the body's defense mechanisms and can be involved in the etiology and evolution of systemic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of various stressors to which sport horses are commonly subjected on the innate immune system. For this, four experimental protocols were designed including different animals, namely: (a) resting horses subjected to everyday medium level exercise (n = 18, average age = 7 years, range: 6 to 11 years), (b) medium course transportation, where the distance of one-way trips represented 270 km (n = 8, average age = 7 years, range: 6 to 9 years), (c) a long course, with a 561 km one-way distance (n = 5, average age = 8.2, range: 7 to 11 years) and (d) pre- and post-competition investigations (n = 9, average age = 7 years, range: 6 to 11). Blood was sampled on heparine (50 UI/ml) before and after the workout or transportation. The phagocytic activity of leukocytes was measured by a carbon particle inclusion test, along with total immunoglobulin/opsonin levels (Ig) (24% Zn sulphate precipitation test) and circulating immune complexes (4.2% polyethylene glycol precipitation test). The results were statistically interpreted by use of Micrososft Excel program (Student's t test). The various types of stress differently influenced the equine athletes. While a moderate daily exercise did not substantially influence the humoral and cellular effectors of innate immunity, transportation exerted stronger beneficial effects based on the distance to the competition site. As a fast acting antimicrobial mechanism, the phagocytosis underwent the most pronounced changes, positively influenced mainly by the short course transportation. While the transportation stress enhanced phagocytosis, the competition decreased the potential of the cells to react, without significantly influencing their numbers. The experiment suggested that management measures, such as age-tailored exercise and maternal care and diet could help in alleviating stress from stable to stable, during the competition season, thus improving animal welfare and allowing a better health forecast. © 2024 Polskie Towarzystwo Nauk Weterynaryjnych.

ABSTRACT: There are various methods like composting, combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and anaerobic digestion to convert animal wastes that harm the environment into various bio-products. Horse manure containing lower ash and higher rate of lignin compositions can be potentially reuse as a valuable feedstock in anaerobic digestion method to produce nutrient-rich digestate (bio-fertilizer) clean and cheap biofuels, and bio-energy to replace the cost effective fossil fuels which not only make climate change but harms our health by generating toxic emissions and contamination of soil and water. Therefore, converting bio wastes into useful green resources especially using anaerobic co-digestion is necessary to reduce their adverse environmental impact and can contribute towards the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13 and 15. As can be seen today, various animal manure types have begun to be used in different situations for their green benefits. This review aimed to provide an overview of the transformation of horse manure into compost, biogas in terms of its preferability as a renewable energy source or a value-added product that mitigate the environmental problems and contribute to the SDGs specially 7, 9, 12, and 13. The potential of animal manure to produce biomaterials, organic acids, biofuels and bioenergy is clear. Therefore, bioprocesses or biorefineries using this biomass as raw material may be promising in the near future in the context of bioeconomy, may help increase renewable energy production and may become capable of promoting innovation that boosts the value of livestock-derived organic fertilizers. There are still needs to extend the development of technologies for converting on-site bio waste resources to useful forms, exploring new and safe biological conversion pathways and bio waste processing methods. © The Author(s) 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Congenital myotonia is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by delayed relaxation of the musculature following a strong contraction. Variants in the skeletal muscle chloride channel 1 gene (CLCN1) have been linked to this disorder across several species. The CLCN1_c.1775A>C, an autosomal recessive variant, was identified as a potential causative factor for congenital myotonia in New Forest Pony. While the CLCN1_c.1775A>C variant has been studied in different breeds of horses, it remains unexplored in Brazilian Quarter Horses. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of the CLCN1_c.1775A>C variant among Brazilian Quarter Horses across various disciplines. Materials, Methods & Results: In this study, 96 DNA samples were obtained from athletic Brazilian Quarter Horses representing various disciplines, 24 each from cutting, reining, barrel racing, and bull-cacthing (“vaquejada”). DNA viability was assessed via PCR targeting the β-actin gene. Subsequently, a previously described set of specific primers was employed to amplify the region encompassing the CLCN1_c.1775A>C variant. The resulting purified PCR products underwent Sanger direct sequencing, and their electropherograms were analyzed. Notably, none of the horses in this cohort were found to carry the CLCN1_c.1775A>C variant. The inbreeding coefficient (F) was calculated using pedigree data sourced from the 96 Quarter Horses according to Brazilian Quarter Horse Breeders Association records encompassing 4 generations. The average F value for the entire cohort was found to be 0.2%. However, when assessed across disciplines, the average F values varied, with cutting at 0.002 (0.2%), reining at 0.003 (0.3%), barrel racing at 0.0008 (0.08%), and bull-cacthing at 0.001 (0.1%), respectively. Notably, within this cohort, 48 horses were identified as inbred, exhibiting an average F of 1.5%. Discussion: Genetic variants associated with conditions such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, myosin heavy chain myopathy, and polysaccharide storage myopathy type 1 have been previously documented in Quarter Horses globally, including Brazil. However, as in the present study, the CLCN1 c.1775A>C variant was also not detected in American Quarter Horses affected by muscular disorders. Although this variant has been implicated as the cause of congenital myotonia in a New Forest pony, its correlation with cases of congenital myotonia in Quarter Horses has not been established yet. Although the inbreeding coefficient and the prevalence of endogamous horses observed in this study were lower compared to findings in other studies, the presence of inbreeding and shared ancestors within Quarter Horses lineages was evident. High rates of inbreeding may disseminate undesirable genetic variants, since popular stallions may improve the athletic performance of its progenies but also may transmit alleles with pathogenic variants, as seen in other genetic disorders in horses. Differently, since it was not observed in this group of evaluated Quarter Horses nor in other previous studies, it may be that the CLCN1 c.1775A>C is a 'de novo' variant related strictly to congenital myotonia in the New Forest pony. Nevertheless, it is imperative to highlight the potential for congenital myotonia to inflict significant harm upon horses. Investigations into new cases are essential to establish both clinical and etiological diagnoses, thereby enabling the assessment of the requisite preventive measures against this disorder. © 2024 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is a high prevalence of obesity in ponies and pleasure horses. This may be associated with equine metabolic syndrome and an increased risk of laminitis. Body condition scoring (BCS) systems are widely used but are subjective and not very sensitive. Objectives: To derive a body condition index (BCI), based on objective morphometric measurements, that correlates with % body fat. Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Morphometric measurements were obtained from 21 ponies and horses in obese and moderate body condition. Percentage body fat was determined using the deuterium dilution method and the BCI was derived to give the optimal correlation with body fat, applying appropriate weightings. The index was then validated by assessing inter-observer variation and correlation with % body fat in a separate population of Welsh ponies; and finally, the correlation between BCI and BCS was evaluated in larger populations from studies undertaken in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Results: The BCI correlated well with adiposity in the ponies and horses, giving a Pearson r value of 0.74 (P < 0.001); however, it was found to slightly overestimate the % body fat in leaner animals and underestimate in more obese animals. In field studies, the correlation between BCI and BCS varied particularly in Shetlands and miniature ponies, presumably due to differences in body shape. Main limitations: Further work may be required to adapt the BCI to a method that is more applicable for Shetlands and miniature ponies. Conclusions: This BCI was able to provide an index of adiposity which compared favourably with condition scoring in terms of accuracy of estimating adiposity; and was more consistent and repeatable when used by inexperienced assessors. Therefore, this may be a useful tool for assessing adiposity; and may be more sensitive than condition scoring for tracking weight gain or weight loss in individual animals. © 2023 Mars Horsecare UK Ltd and The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An 18-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was referred for further investigation and treatment of acute colic. Exploratory celiotomy was recommended based on the degree of suspected large colon distension on rectal palpation, and only transient reprieve from colic signs following analgesia. This subsequently revealed an intussusception affecting the left dorsal colon (LDC) with the orad LDC (intussusceptum) within the aborad LDC (intussuscipiens). The intussusception, approximately 20 cm in length, was obstructing the colon. Following exteriorisation, reduction of the intussusception was performed, but marked thickening of the colon wall and luminal obstruction led to the decision to perform a partial colon resection of the left dorsal and ventral colon and side-to-side anastomosis. The gelding made an unremarkable recovery from anaesthesia and progressed well post-operatively. Histopathology found no clear cause of the intussusception. Follow-up (11 months post-operatively) confirmed complete recovery and the horse had returned to the previous level of light exercise. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness (AHS) is a highly severe disease caused by a viral etiological agent, African horse sickness virus (AHSV). It is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, while sporadic outbreaks have occurred in North Africa, Asia, and Europe, with the most recent cases in Thailand. AHSV transmission between equines occurs primarily by biting midges of the genus Culicoides, especially C. imicola, with a wide distribution globally. As research in horses is highly restricted due to a variety of factors, small laboratory animal models that reproduce clinical signs and pathology observed in natural infection of AHSV are highly needed. Here, we investigated the expression profile of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in target organs and serum of IFNAR (-/-) mice, to continue characterizing this established animal model and to go deep into the innate immune responses that are still needed. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This chapter discusses the general concepts to issues related to antimicrobial drug use and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) for horses. Equine medicine is less progressive on AMS than other species-specific branches of veterinary medicine. Equine medicine is less progressive on AMS than other species-specific branches of veterinary medicine. Equine medicine is frequently faced with a lack of availability of approved veterinary medicinal products, including antimicrobials, since horses represent small pharmaceutical markets, or markets with low economic importance. Polymicrobial and mixed anaerobic-aerobic infections are common in horses with pleuropneumonia. Thus, cytology, Gram-stained smears, culture and susceptibility are essential to direct antimicrobial therapy. Horses and humans utilize sweating as their primary cooling mechanism. Sweating is also part of the disease response to pain (e.g., colic) or fever. Cytology is often used for a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial skin disease. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Horses and cattle have shown low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and there is no evidence of experimental intraspecies transmission. Nonetheless, seropositive horses in the US and seropositive cattle in Germany and Italy have been reported. The current study investigated the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in horses and cattle in Switzerland. In total, 1940 serum and plasma samples from 1110 horses and 830 cattle were screened with a species-specific ELISA based on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and, in the case of suspect positive results, a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) was used to demonstrate the neutralizing activity of the antibodies. Further confirmation of suspect positive samples was performed using either a pseudotype-based virus neutralization assay (PVNA; horses) or an indirect immunofluorescence test (IFA; cattle). The animals were sampled between February 2020 and December 2022. Additionally, in total, 486 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), oropharyngeal, nasal and rectal swab samples from horses and cattle were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Six horses (0.5%; 95% CI: 0.2–1.2%) were suspect positive via RBD-ELISA, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in two of them via confirmatory sVNT and PVNA tests. In the PVNA, the highest titers were measured against the Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Fifteen cattle (1.8%; 95% CI: 1.0–3.0%) were suspect positive in RBD-ELISA; 3 of them had SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in sVNT and 4 of the 15 were confirmed to be positive via IFA. All tested samples were RT-qPCR-negative. The results support the hypotheses that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in horses and cattle in Switzerland was low up to the end of 2022. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The main goal of the Belgian Warmblood horse studbook (BWP) is to breed successful competition horses, with emphasis on show jumping. However, competition results are only available later in life and competition traits are lowly heritable. Hence, the use of phenotypes that record performance-related traits at an early life stage could help increase genetic progress. In this study, we evaluated the potential of eleven linear scored early life jumping traits assessed during jumping in freedom (2–5 years old) or under the saddle (4–6 years old) as proxies for later success in show jumping competitions. To this end, we estimated their heritabilities and genetic correlations with the competition trait, adjusted fence height, by using 2170 free jumping records, 1588 jumping under saddle records, 674,527 show jumping competition records and almost 81,000 informative horses in the pedigree. As participation of young horses in these contests is on a voluntary basis, a pre-selection most probably exists. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the association between participation to young horse contests and participation to show jumping competitions later on (called here start status phenotype). We also estimated heritabilities for “start status in free jumping contest”, “start status in jumping under saddle contest” and “start status in free jumping or jumping under saddle contest” by fitting threshold models. Furthermore, we calculated genetic correlations between these traits and adjusted fence height and calculated the correlations between EBVs for start status in young horse contests and EBVs for success in competitions. Estimated heritabilities of early life jumping traits ranged between 0.05 and 0.30. Their genetic correlations with adjusted fence height were moderate to high (rg = 0.37–0.63). Relatively more horses that participated in young horse contests competed later on compared to horses that did not participate in young horse contests (p-value < 0.001). They were also significantly more successful in show jumping competitions. Furthermore, start status in young horse contests was moderately heritable in BWP horses (h2 = 0.56–0.65) and moderately to highly correlated with later success in competitions (rg = 0.30–0.77). Hence, we showed that ELJ traits are good proxies for later success in competitions and that a pre-selection of horses occurs in young horse contests. It is suggested to stimulate participation to young horse contests to achieve a more representative sample of the population. Early life jumping traits can therefore optimize the genetic progress for show jumping performance. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Effective communication and bonding between species depend on understanding the emotional state and the expressive behavior of the counterpart. This is of particular importance for human-horse relationships, as misunderstanding horses’ communicative signals can easily lead to severe injuries. While the published evidence suggests that the human ability to correctly interpret equine affective states is far from perfect, this evidence is inconclusive regarding the influence of previous experience with horses. Further, the role of emotion recognition ability as well as the interaction of the two factors – horse-experience and emotion recognition ability – are poorly understood. Method: To fill this gap, we employed an online survey asking participants to interpret 32 different photographs of horses’ body language depicting different affective states. Additionally, we assessed participants’ emotion recognition ability by means of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test and asked them to provide socio-demographic information (i.e., age, gender, horse-experience). Results: Our results suggest (1) that horse-experienced individuals performed better in interpreting horses’ affective states than horse-inexperienced participants and (2) that participants with a high emotion recognition ability performed better in interpreting horses’ affective states than participants with a low emotion recognition ability. We did not find evidence for an interaction of emotion recognition ability and horse-experience. Importantly, our results remained significant irrespective of how we defined “experienced” vs. “inexperienced” and after controlling for unequal gender distributions across these two groups. Discussion: Our study showed that previous experience with horses and emotion recognition ability both affect the interpretation of horses‘ affective states. The effect for previous experience was much larger than for emotion recognition ability. However, even horse-experienced individuals only correctly identified about 50% of the affective states. The findings are discussed with regard to findings from previous and directions for future research. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Equine thyroid disorders pose a diagnostic challenge in clinical practice because of the effects of nonthyroidal factors on the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis, and the horse's ability to tolerate wide fluctuations in thyroid hormone concentrations and survive without a thyroid gland. While benign thyroid tumours are common in older horses, other disorders like primary hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in adult horses and congenital hypothyroidism in foals are rare. There is a common misunderstanding regarding hypothyroidism in adult horses, especially when associated with the clinical profile of obesity, lethargy, and poor performance observed in dogs and humans. Low blood thyroid hormone concentrations are often detected in horses as a secondary response to metabolic and disease states, including with the nonthyroidal illness syndrome; however, it is important to note that low thyroid hormone concentrations in these cases do not necessarily indicate hypothyroidism. Assessing equine thyroid function involves measuring thyroid hormone concentrations, including total and free fractions of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3); however, interpreting these results can be challenging due to the pulsatile secretion of thyroid hormones and the many factors that can affect their concentrations. Dynamic testing, such as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, can help assess the thyroid gland response to stimulation. Although true hypothyroidism is extremely rare, thyroid hormone supplementation is commonly used in equine practice to help manage obesity and poor performance. This review focuses on thyroid gland pathophysiology in adult horses and foals, interpretation of blood thyroid hormone concentrations, and evaluation of horses with thyroid disorders. It also discusses the use of T4 supplementation in equine practice. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Context. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are a species of social, economic and cultural importance that are experiencing a population decline throughout much of their range. Factors such as disease, landscape-level changes in nutritional output of forage species, winter habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, competition for resources with both domestic and wild ungulates, and predation have all been implicated in the decline. Recently, summer habitat quality in Oregon has been identified as a potentially strong limiting factor for mule deer population performance. Competition and habitat degradation from feral horses (Equus caballus) have been proposed as factors potentially exacerbating existing habitat limitations for mule deer. Aims. The aim of this study was to investigate factors affecting mule deer summer range occupancy within a study area that experienced both wildfires and the presence of feral horses. Methods. We deployed 72, 77 and 75 camera traps throughout the Murderers Creek and Northside wildlife management units located in north-eastern Oregon during summer 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. We used an occupancy modelling framework to build and evaluate models of mule deer summer range occupancy related to competition, vegetation and abiotic variables. Key results. Our final model set included four covariates: (1) an index of feral horse use; (2) whether the site was disturbed by wildfire; (3) distance to forest edge; and (4) eastness of the site. Model averaging indicated that mule deer probability of occupancy was negatively related with increased feral horse use and distance to forest edge, and positively related to eastern slopes and sites within a wildfire perimeter. Conclusions. Our results add to the growing body of literature indicating that wildfires in forested ecosystems benefit mule deer and add to the limited body of literature indicating that feral horse use of a site negatively impacts mule deer. Implications. Managers should incorporate fire into forest restoration projects when possible to benefit mule deer. Where feral horses and mule deer overlap, increased management of feral horse herds could potentially benefit mule deer. Lastly, our research showcases the utility of camera traps coupled with occupancy modelling to answer research questions that, in the past, were mainly answered through radio collaring. © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

ABSTRACT: Bacterial pneumonia is a common disease in adult horses, but there are no guidelines for practitioners regarding risk factors, diagnosis, and management of the disease. The objectives of this study were to describe how a group of equine veterinarians diagnose and treat bacterial pneumonia in adult horses. A 22-question survey was distributed via multiple platforms to equine veterinarians asking questions regarding the frequency with which they identified specific clinical findings and used certain diagnostic modalities, and the approach to antimicrobial and adjunct therapy. Three hundred nine survey responses were received of which 244 were complete and used in the final analyses. There are significant differences in the ways that different equine veterinarians diagnose and treat bacterial pneumonia based on practice type and training of the practitioner. The majority of practitioners treat with antimicrobials for longer than 2 weeks, and only 53.3% of respondents reported that they “always” or “most of the time” used culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide therapy. There is a need for guidelines to reduce the duration of therapy and improve antimicrobial stewardship when treating bacterial pneumonia in horses. Copyright © 2024 Hepworth-Warren and Love.

ABSTRACT: Horses undergoing abdominal exploratory surgery are at risk of hypotension and hypoperfusion. Normal mean arterial pressure is used as a surrogate for adequate tissue perfusion. However, measures of systemic circulation may not be reflective of microcirculation. This study measured the mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, lactate, and four microcirculatory indices in six healthy, anesthetized adult horses undergoing elective laparotomies. The microcirculatory parameters were measured at three different sites along the gastrointestinal tract (oral mucosa, colonic serosa, and rectal mucosa) with dark-field microscopy. All macro- and microcirculatory parameters were obtained when the horses were normotensive, hypotensive, and when normotension returned following treatment with dobutamine. Hypotension was induced with increases in inhaled isoflurane. The horses successfully induced into hypotension did not demonstrate consistent, expected changes in systemic perfusion or microvascular perfusion parameters at any of the three measured gastrointestinal sites. Normotension was successfully restored with the use of dobutamine, while the systemic perfusion and microvascular perfusion parameters remained relatively unchanged. These findings suggest that the use of mean arterial pressure to make clinical decisions regarding perfusion may or may not be accurate. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus) is a national protected species in China. It first became extinct in the wild in 1976, and was reintroduced to the Kalamaili National Park (KNP) in Xinjiang, China in 2001. This study aimed to analyze the genetic diversity and structure of the reintroduced population of Przewalski’s horse in KNP. Here, we developed and designed microsatellite molecular markers using 48 feces samples and combined this with published genomic data from the species. A preliminary analysis of genetic diversity within the Przewalski’s horse population in the KNP was conducted using 16 pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers with high levels of polymorphism and high stability. A total of 199 alleles were amplified using 16 SSR primer pairs, averaging 12.438 at each locus. In the sample of 48 genomes, the average effective number of alleles detected was 2.695, the average expected heterozygosity was 0.577 and the inbreeding coefficient was 0.232. Twelve loci showed significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium following Bonferroni sequential corrections. Our research finds that the genetic diversity of the Przewalski’s horse population in the KNP remains high. This is the first research using newly developed SSR markers to describe the genetic diversity and structure of the reintroduced Przewalski’s horse population in KNP, China. As such, it can inform future reintroductions of the species and conservation measures. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

ABSTRACT: Aims: Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Corynebacterium ulcerans, when producing toxin, are the cause of diphtheria, a potentially life-threatening illness in humans. Horses (Equus ferus caballus) are known to be susceptible to infection that may manifest clinically on rare occasions. In late 2021 and early 2022, specimens from five horses suffering from pastern dermatitis were cultured at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland. C. diphtheriae and/or C. ulcerans were recovered from all of these. This study aimed to (1) analyse the bacterial isolates and (2) describe the outbreak and identify possible sources of the infection and infection routes in the stable. Methods and Results: Susceptibility testing, PCR for the tox gene, and Elek test for toxin production in PCR-positive isolates were performed. Whole genome sequencing was also conducted to achieve high-resolution strain typing. An epidemiological survey was done by means of a semi-structured interview of horses' caretaker, and contact tracing was done among people at the stable. Two tox gene-positive, toxin-producing C. diphtheriae belonged to sequence type (ST) 822. Other C. diphtheriae (n = 2, ST828) and C. ulcerans (n = 2, ST325 and ST838) isolates did not carry the tox gene. The epidemiological investigation explored numerous possible routes of transmission, but the definite source of infection was not identified. All established human contacts tested negative for diphtheriae. All horses recovered after antimicrobial treatment. Conclusions: Our study shows that C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans may readily spread among horses at the same stable and complicate pastern dermatitis infections. These potentially zoonotic bacteria can cause outbreaks even in a country with a very low prevalence. Caretakers should be encouraged to wear gloves and practice good hand hygiene when treating infected skin lesions in horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine sarcoids are common skin tumors that are thought to be caused by cross-species infection by bovine papillomaviruses (BPV). A 16-year-old horse developed a 1cm diameter mandibular gingival mass opposite the right second premolar tooth (406) and a 2cm diameter mass close to the commissure of the lips on the same side of the mouth. The right cheek was diffusely thickened. Histology of the smaller mass revealed a proliferation of mesenchymal cells covered by hyperplastic epithelium that formed thick rete pegs. BPV2 DNA was amplified from the mass. Although the mass had been incompletely excised, there was no recurrence after 5 months. The histological features and detection of BPV2 DNA is consistent with a diagnosis of equine sarcoid. Sarcoids have not previously been reported in the oral cavity of horses. It is hypothesized that trauma to the mouth may have been important for sarcoid development. Additionally, different BPV types may have variable ability to infect the gingiva. While rare, sarcoids are a differential for an oral mass in a horse. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report the use and feasibility of a self-locking resorbable loop device for cryptorchidectomy. Study design: Clinical prospective study. Population: Twenty horses. Methods: Horses suspected to have an abdominal testicle/s after admission work-up were enrolled. Horses were anesthetized in dorsal recumbency and a standard laparoscopic technique was performed. The looped device was inserted into the abdomen, glided around the testis/cord and tightened. Then, the spermatic cord was transected prior testis removal. Surgical procedure details and remarks, perioperative complications and total surgical time were recorded. Short- (>3 weeks) and long-term (>6 months) follow-ups were obtained by telephone questionnaire. Results: Median total surgical time was 67 min (range: 43–189 min) and significantly shortened after the first four horses. The loop device was easily glided around 13/20 abdominal testes and required more time and technical skills around larger testes (≥3 years). Excellent intraoperative hemostasis was achieved in 17 horses. Three horses demonstrated mild intraoperative bleeding that required retightening, device replacement or adding a second device, respectively. Three horses developed mild postoperative hemoabdomen identified ultrasonographically and were successfully managed medically. Follow-up revealed no significant complications related to the procedure. One horse was euthanized for colic 4 months after surgery and one died of hemolytic shock 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion: This device represents another method to perform equine cryptorchidectomy that requires minimal training and laparoscopic expertise but demands knowledge of the device and application to prevent complications. Clinical significance: Laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy using this device is an alternative technique for horses <3 years. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: During neurological EHV-1 outbreaks, modified-live vaccines (MLV) are often administrated intranasally in an off-label fashion to healthy cohort horses in order to achieve rapid mucosal immunity. Thus, the goal of the present study was to determine if a commercially available EHV-1 MLV given intranasally to healthy horses would trigger a measurable systemic and/or mucosal antibody response. Eight healthy adult horses were given the EHV-1 MLV vaccine intranasally, while 8 healthy adult horses received the vaccine intramuscularly. An additional 8 healthy horses served as unvaccinated controls. EHV-1 specific antibodies (total IgG, IgG4/7, IgG1 and IgA) were measured in blood and nasal secretions prior to vaccine administration and 14- and 30-days post-vaccine administration. Further, nasal secretions and whole blood were tested for the presence of EHV-1 DNA by qPCR prior to and 5 days after vaccine administration. EHV-1 was detected by qPCR for the first 48 hours post-intranasal vaccine administration in nasal secretions in a total of three horses. Total EHV-1 IgG and IgG4/7 antibody values in serum increased only in horses receiving the intramuscular MLV. Antibody values at 14- and 30-days post vaccine administration were not different from values prior to vaccine administration in horses receiving the intranasal vaccine. The results support the intramuscular use of the EHV-1 MLV as recommended by the manufacturer. Intranasal vaccination with the study-specific EHV-1 MLV did not induce an increase in systemic or nasal antibodies, therefore, this vaccine route seems suboptimal and should not be used to vaccinate adult horses that have received multiple EHV-1 vaccinations and have pre-existing antibodies against EHV-1. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Infection with equid herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1), a DNA virus of the Herpesviridae family represents a significant welfare issue in horses and a great impact on the equine industry. During EHV-1 infection, entry of the virus into different cell types is complex due to the presence of twelve glycoproteins (GPs) on the viral envelope. To investigate virus entry mechanisms, specific combinations of GPs were pseudotyped onto lentiviral vectors. Pseudotyped virus (PV) particles bearing gB, gD, gH and gL were able to transduce several target cell lines (HEK293T/17, RK13, CHO-K1, FHK-Tcl3, MDCK I & II), demonstrating that these four EHV-1 glycoproteins are both essential and sufficient for cell entry. The successful generation of an EHV-1 PV permitted development of a PV neutralisation assay (PVNA). The efficacy of the PVNA was tested by measuring the level of neutralising serum antibodies from EHV-1 experimentally infected horses (n = 52) sampled in a longitudinal manner. The same sera were assessed using a conventional EHV-1 virus neutralisation (VN) assay, exhibiting a strong correlation (r = 0.82) between the two assays. Furthermore, PVs routinely require -80 °C for long term storage and a dry ice cold-chain during transport, which can impede dissemination and utilisation in other stakeholder laboratories. Consequently, lyophilisation of EHV-1 PVs was conducted to address this issue. PVs were lyophilised and pellets either reconstituted immediately or stored under various temperature conditions for different time periods. The recovery and functionality of these lyophilised PVs was compared with standard frozen aliquots in titration and neutralisation tests. Results indicated that lyophilisation could be used to stably preserve such complex herpesvirus pseudotypes, even after weeks of storage at room temperature, and that reconstituted EHV-1 PVs could be successfully employed in antibody neutralisation tests. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Equine-assisted therapies are becoming increasingly popular for addressing physical and psychological disabilities in clients. The role of the horse’s welfare in equine-assisted service receives increasing attention in research. Several studies have shown that horses are able to perceive human emotions and respond to human stress responses. However, no research has yet looked at the other side of the coin—whether and how humans perceive and react to equine stress levels during equine-assisted services. To fill this gap in the research, we employed a within-subjects design, in which horse-naïve participants had a standardized interaction with both an experimentally stressed horse and an experimentally relaxed horse. We assessed physiological indicators of stress (heart rate, heart rate variability, and salivary cortisol) in participants and horses, as well as psychological indicators of stress (state anxiety and positive and negative affect) in participants. Although our stress and relaxation manipulations were successful (indicated by horses’ physiological indicators of stress), we did not find any difference in the participants’ physiological or psychological indicators of stress between the interaction with a stressed and the interaction with a relaxed horse. Together with results from previous studies, this suggests that humans cannot intuitively recognize the (physiological) stress level of horses, which has important implications for effective communication and bonding between humans and horses and for the safety of equine activities. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is currently one of the more frequent diseases in horses. We aimed to identify changes in the salivary proteome in horses with EGUS at diagnosis and after successful treatment by using gel proteomics. Saliva samples were collected from nine horses with EGUS before and after treatment and nine matched healthy controls. SDS-PAGE (1DE) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) were performed, and significantly different protein bands and spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Horses with EGUS had increases in proteins such as adenosine deaminase (ADA), triosephosphate isomerase, keratins and immuno-globulin heavy constant mu and decreases in carbonic anhydrase (CA), albumin and prolactin-induced protein. These changes would indicate various physiopathological mechanisms involved in this disease, such as the activation of the immune system, decreased stomach defence mechanisms and inflammation. The treated horses presented lower expression levels of thioredoxin (TRX) after a successful treatment, in proteomics analysis and also measured with a commercially available ELISA kit. Overall, horses with EGUS have protein changes in their saliva when measured with gel proteomics compared with healthy horses, and they also showed changes after successful treatment. These proteins could be potential biomarkers for detection and monitoring treatment response in EGUS. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The immunogenome is the part of the genome that underlies immune mechanisms and evolves under various selective pressures. Two complex regions of the immunogenome, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and natural killer cell receptor (NKR) genes, play an important role in the response to selective pressures of pathogens. Their importance is expressed by their genetic polymorphism at the molecular level, and their diversity associated with different types of diseases at the population level. Findings of associations between specific combinations of MHC/NKR haplotypes with different diseases in model species suggest that these gene complexes did not evolve independently. No such associations have been described in horses so far. The aim of the study was to detect associations between MHC and NKR gene/microsatellite haplotypes in three horse breed groups (Camargue, African, and Romanian) by statistical methods; chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Pearson's goodness-of-fit test and logistic regression. Associations were detected for both MHC/NKR genes and microsatellites; the most significant associations were found between the most variable KLRA3 gene and the EQCA-1 or EQCA-2 genes. This finding supports the assumption that the KLRA3 is an important receptor for MHC I and that interactions of these molecules play important roles in the horse immunity and reproduction. Despite some limitations of the study such as low numbers of horses or lack of knowledge of the selected genes functions, the results were consistent across different statistical methods and remained significant even after overconservative Bonferroni corrections. We therefore consider them biologically plausible. © 2024 The Authors. HLA: Immune Response Genetics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Hyperinsulinemia-associated laminitis (HAL) is the primary concern for insulin dysregulated (ID) equids and their insulin response to the consumption of oral, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) has been shown to be a risk predictor for HAL development. This randomized, crossover study's objective was to examine the insulinemic responses to 3 forage pellets (1 g/kg BW) (timothy hay, TH, 9.5 % CP & 10 % NSC DM; alfalfa hay, AH, 16.3 % CP & 9.8 % NSC DM; timothy-alfalfa hay; TAH, 17.2 % CP & 9.8 % NSC DM) along with a positive (dehulled oats; OG, 14.7 % CP & 59.7 % NSC DM) and negative dietary challenge control (low-NSC; LNSC, 12.8 % CP & 5.4 % NSC DM) of ID (n = 8; 16.1 ± 2.2 yr; 565.4 ± 99.1 kgs.) and non-ID (NID; n = 7; 17.0 ± 2.8 yr; 583.6 ± 57.9 kgs.) horses. ID horses had higher positive incremental area under the curve for insulin (IAUCi) (ID: 890 ± 925 µIU/mL*minute vs. NID: 225 ± 228 µIU/mL*minute), peak (ID: 101.5 ± 80.72 µIU/mL vs. NID: 25.7 ± 7.2 µIU/mL), and delta (ID: 45.5 ± 77.1 µIU/mL vs. NID: 4.9 ± 5.3 µIU/mL) insulin for all forage pellets compared to NID (p < 0.01). ID horses IAUCi for the forage pellets was not different compared to the LNSC (218 ± 327 µIU/mL*minute) but was different from OG (10,522 ± 4,565 µIU/mL*minute). ID horses’ lack of an augmented insulinemic response to the low NSC forage pellets (fed in small amounts) indicates that they could be a safe feedstuff for ID animals. © 2023

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study aimed to assess the incidence of hypotension and the subsequent administration of dobutamine in horses anesthetized with isoflurane and romifidine during elective surgery. Time from induction of anaesthesia to administration of dobutamine was registered, as well as the time and dose needed to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 70 mmHg. Additionally, the influence of patient and anaesthesia related parameters on the need for dobutamine supplementation was evaluated. In total, 118 horses were included in this retrospective study. Dobutamine was administered to effect when MAP<70 mmHg. Data registered: patient weight, acepromazine premedication, body position, administration of intraoperative ketamine bolus, locoregional anaesthesia, mechanical ventilation, duration of anaesthesia, dose and duration of dobutamine administration, heart rate, MAP before dobutamine administration, MAP and time required to increase MAP≥70 mmHg. Dobutamine infusion was needed in 54.2% of the horses 30 ± 17 min after isoflurane-romifidine anaesthesia started. Dobutamine 0.55 ± 0.18 μg kg−1 min−1 achieved a MAP≥70 mmHg in 12 ± 8 min. Duration of dobutamine infusion was 56 ± 37 min. An univariable logistic regression showed a significant association between dobutamine and acepromazine administration (p = 0.01; OR = 3.43), anaesthesia time (p = 0.02; OR = 2.41) and dorsal recumbency (p < 0.001; OR = 8.40). In a multivariable logistic regression, only dorsal recumbency significantly increased the need for dobutamine supplementation (p < 0.001; OR = 7.70). There was no significant association between patient weight (p = 0.11; OR = 1), locoregional anaesthesia (p = 0.07; OR = 0.47), administration of a ketamine bolus (p = 0.95; OR = 0.98) or volume controlled ventilation (p = 0.94; OR = 1.04) and dobutamine administration. Low doses of dobutamine were suitable to restore MAP above 70 mmHg within a limited time period. Only dorsal recumbency increased the need of dobutamine administration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Boldenone is an anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) that is prohibited in equine sports. However, in certain situations, it is endogenous, potentially formed by the microbes in urine. An approach to the differentiation based on the detection of the biomarkers Δ1-progesterone, 20(S)-hydroxy-Δ1-progesterone and 20(S)-hydroxyprogesterone was assessed, and their concentrations were monitored in the urine of untreated female horses (n = 291) alongside boldenone, boldienone, testosterone and androstenedione. Using an ultra-sensitive analytical method, boldenone (256 ± 236 pg/mL, n = 290) and the biomarkers (Δ1-progesterone up to 57.6 pg/mL, n = 8; 20(S)-hydroxy-Δ1-progesterone 85.3 ± 181 pg/mL, n = 130; 20(S)-hydroxyprogesterone 43.5 ± 92.1 pg/mL, n = 158) were detected at low concentrations. The ex vivo production of Δ1-steroids was artificially induced following the storage of urine samples at room temperature for 7 days in order to assess the concentrations and ratios of the monitored steroids. The administration of inappropriately stored feed source also resulted in an increase in 20(S)-hydroxy-Δ1-progesterone concentrations and the biomarker ratios. Using the results from different datasets, an approach to differentiation was developed. In situations where the presence of boldenone exceeds a proposed action limit of 5 ng/mL, the presence of the biomarkers would be investigated. If Δ1-progesterone is above 50 pg/mL or if 20(S)-hydroxy-Δ1-progesterone is above 100 pg/mL with the ratio of 20(S)-hydroxy-Δ1-progesterone:20(S)-hydroxyprogesterone greater than 5:1, then this would indicate ex vivo transformation or consumption of altered feed rather than steroid administration. There remains a (small) possibility of a false negative result, but the model increases confidence that adverse analytical findings reported in female horses are caused by AAS administrations. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Opioids are widely used in veterinary medicine, but their use is restricted in horses due to their potential adverse effects, such as reduced intestinal motility and excitation. Morphine and tramadol are opioids recommended for pain control in horses, and the absorption of these drugs by the epidural route is relatively slow due to low lipid solubility, resulting in longer duration of the analgesic effect and a reduction in undesirable effects. This study aimed to monitor the clinical and behavioral alterations in horses administered morphine or tramadol by the epidural route. Materials, Methods & Results: Eight horses (2 males and 6 females) with mean weight of 336.3 ± 33.4 kg and age of 5.5 ± 1.3 years were allocated to 3 groups in a cross-over design, in which tramadol (TG) [1 mg/kg], morphine (MG) [0.2 mg/ kg], and 0.9% NaCl (CG) were administered in a previously implanted epidural catheter. The clinical parameters heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (rR), rectal temperature (RT) were measured before treatment administration (MB), 5 (M5), 10 (M10), 20 (M20), 30 (M30), 40 (M40), 50 (M50), and 60 min (M60) after epidural injection. Intestinal motility scores, latency to defecate, and behavioral alterations were evaluated at MB, M10, M30, M60, 120 (M120), 240 (M240), 480 (M480), and 960 min (M960) after treatment administration. Parametric data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls retest and non-parametric data to the Friedman or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn's test, both with significance set at P ≤ 0.05. Rectal temperature increased considerably in the CG animals from MB (36.8°C) to M60 (37.4°C) and in the MG at M20 and M60 (37.4°C) in relation to MB (36.9°C). The values of HR, rR, and motility scores on the left side did not vary significantly between groups and moments. However, there was a 40% reduction in right-sided intestinal motility scores (upper and lower quadrants) in the MG. In addition, the total intestinal motility score (sum of the four quadrants), 30 min after treatment administration, remained reduced until M120, compared to MB. Concomitantly, 50% of the MG animals had increased latency to defecate, although this was not significant. Discussion: The maintenance of heart rate and respiratory rate parameters after administration of morphine [0.2 mg/kg] by the epidural route is related to the absence of sympathetic interference and the route of administration. Similarly, the study found no significant differences in the cardiorespiratory system after epidural administration of tramadol at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Generally, such alterations are associated with high doses, associations with other pharmacological classes, or exacerbated use of the opioid. The increase in body temperature in CG and MG is presumably associated with climatic conditions, as it was believed that opioids did not interfere with this parameter. The drop in right-sided and total intestinal motility scores in MG triggered an increase in latency to defecate, which may be associated with the blockade of opioid receptors in the myenteric nervous system, which promotes a reduction in cholinergic tone. There were no alterations in the motility score and latency to defecate after epidural administration of tramadol, as there were after oral or intravenous administration. The slight alterations and absence of variations in clinical parameters caused by the administration of morphine and tramadol by the epidural route in horses, respectively, reinforce the use of these drugs in pain control, given their analgesic potential, already proven in previous studies. © 2024 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ABSTRACT: Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease affecting all mammalian species. It is caused by the rabies virus and is prevalent worldwide. Horses are not commonly infected with rabies but their vaccination is recommended due to the potential zoonotic risk. This study aimed to evaluate the duration of immunity following rabies vaccination in horses. A total of 126 serum samples were collected from 93 horses, vaccinated 6 to 91 months before sampling. Rabies-virus-neutralizing antibody (RVNA) levels were evaluated using the Rabies Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT). A protective RVNA titer of above 0.5 IU/mL was found in 112 (88.9%) of the samples and 84 (90.3%) of the horses. Antibody titers declined over time (rho = −0.271, p = 0.002); however, there was no significant difference in antibody titers or the prevalence of unprotected horses between the time intervals following vaccination. Purebred horses had lower antibody titers (p = 0.024). The response to booster vaccination was inspected in ten horses, and increased antibody titers were found in eight of them. The results of this study demonstrate the prolonged persistence of protective immunity in horses following rabies vaccination, in some cases, for up to eight years. Therefore, the current annual vaccination strategy should be re-evaluated. A rate of 9.7% of poor responders should be considered from an epidemiological perspective in order to minimize the risk of emergence of the disease. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The urgent need to preserve ecosystems over vast areas has placed rewilding with wild herbivores to the forefront. However, there are still few scientific experimental field studies dealing with its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since 1993, in France, a socially natural population of wild horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) has been managed for its conservation. This introduction is an opportunity to compare this new management system with the multi-secular extensive sheep breeding and the more recent conventional domestic horse breeding. We sought to discover if plant communities show differences depending on the grazers and the managing system. We surveyed 208 plots divided into six grazed sites (two sites per type of grazer), where all plants species and their percent cover were listed within 1m2, and environmental variables – such as stones percent cover, slope - were measured within 100m2. To focus on the grazer effects, we used a subsample of plots with similar environmental variables. To study the grazing system - management choices - effects, we ran the analyses using all the plots. At both scales, our results show that species richness, evenness and heterogeneity are significantly higher with wild horses than with sheep grazing. Intermediate value is measured for evenness concerning domestic horses at the grazing system scale. Species richness is significantly higher for domestic horses than sheep focusing on the grazer; intermediate values are measured for evenness and heterogeneity. At both scales, wild horses also favour dicots rather than monocots. Our results indicate that grazing by horses maintains and promotes grassland diversity, especially when horses are managed ‘as wild’ - allowing them to express their natural behaviour. However, further studies are needed focusing on populations of patrimonial plant species over time, other taxonomical groups and/or on functional diversity and ecosystem services to compare and test more finely the effects of an animal bred extensively and ‘as wild’. © 2023

ABSTRACT: An 11-year-old, 500 kg, healthy mare was admitted for tenovaginoscopy. A jugular venous catheter was inserted to administer detomidine for diagnostic imaging and for anaesthesia-related drug administration. The horse was premedicated with intramuscular acepromazine and intravenous flunixin. For sedation, 7.5 mL of a solution, presumed to be xylazine 2%, was drawn up in a syringe and labelled with a sticker. Two minutes after injection of 7.5 mL from xylazine-labelled syringe, the horse showed severe ataxia and fell. Nystagmus and catatonia appeared while one person sat on its neck, to prevent it from rising. After 8 minutes, the horse could not be kept down and took several uncoordinated attempts to stand, still showing nystagmus and ataxia for several minutes. The xylazine-labelled syringes were analysed. They contained pure ketamine. This case report should raise awareness about clinical errors, a healthy error culture and use of Morbidity and Mortality Rounds to improve patient and personnel care. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test is used to diagnose pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) using 10- or 30-min protocols. Imprecise sampling time for the 10-min protocol can lead to misdiagnoses. Objectives: To determine the effect of imprecise sampling time for the 30-min protocol of the TRH stimulation test. Study design: In vivo experiment. Methods: Plasma immunoreactive adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) concentrations were measured 9, 10, 11, 29, 30 and 31 min after intravenous administration of 1 mg of TRH in 15 control and 12 PPID horses. Differences in ACTH concentrations between sampling times, variability in ACTH concentrations between protocols, and diagnostic classification of PPID were assessed using Friedman's test, Bland–Altman plots, and Fisher's exact test, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals reported and significance set at p < 0.05. Results: Imprecise sampling time resulted in variable ACTH concentrations, but significant differences in absolute ACTH concentrations were not detected for imprecise sampling within each protocol or between protocols. Imprecise sampling changed PPID diagnostic classification for 3/27 (11 [4–28] %) horses for both protocols. Using the 30-min protocol as a reference, 1/12 (8 [1–35] %) horses returned a negative test result and 5/12 (42 [19–68] %) horses returned equivocal test results that would be considered positive in practice due to the presence of supportive clinical signs. Main limitations: Limited sample size and inter-horse variability reduced the ability to detect small but potentially relevant differences. Conclusions: Overall, the impact of imprecise sampling was not significantly different between the 10- and 30-min TRH stimulation test protocols. However, diagnostic classification for PPID would have varied between the 10- and 30-min protocols in this population, if clinical signs had been ignored. Precise timing during TRH stimulation tests and contextual interpretation of ACTH concentrations remain fundamental for the diagnosis of PPID. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The global climatic changes pose a substantial threat to the well-being and productivity of both humans and animals. Methods: This study examined the impact of climate changes during different seasons over a 3-year monitoring period (2021–2023) on various blood parameters including, white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The study focused on 25 Thoroughbred mares located in Kastamonu-Türkiye. Thermal and hygrometric parameters, including ambient temperature, relative humidity, and ventilation, were collected. Subsequently, Temperature-Humidity index (THI) was computed. Blood samples were collected on the first day of every month from January 2021 to December 2023 and used for a complete blood count analysis. Between 2021 and 2023, changes in environmental indicators were correlated to changes in hematological parameters. Results: Two-way for repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant seasonal fluctuation (<0.0001) in ambient temperature, relative humidity, and THI. There was a reduction in RBC (<0.01), and MCH (<0.01) every year, HGB (<0.0001) in summer 2021, 2022 and in summer and autumn 2023. HCT (<0.0001), MCV (<0.01), showed decreasing values in autumn 2022 and 2023. MCHC values showed increasing values in July and August 2021, 2022 and in June 2023. WBC levels increased throughout the spring periods of 2021 and 2022. In April 2021, there were elevated levels of lymphocytes and monocytes (<0.0001) respectively. Discussion: These findings could be helpful to promote the monitoring of physiological status both for the assessment of welfare status and for diagnostic purposes for the evaluation of possible disease outbreaks due to climate change in veterinary medicine.

ABSTRACT: A relatively new method to study the species richness and diversity of nematode parasites in grazing animals is to perform deep sequencing on composite samples containing a mixture of parasites. In this work, we compared species composition of strongyles in two groups of horses as a function of egg count and age, based on a DNA barcoding approach. Faecal egg counts and larval cultures were obtained from nearly 300 horses, i.e., domestic horses (n = 167) and trotters (n = 130) sampled nationwide. The second internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2) of strongyle nematodes in the larval cultures was first amplified using barcoded universal primers and then sequenced on the PacBio platform. Subsequently, bioinformatic sequence analysis was performed using SCATA to assign operational taxonomic units (OTU). Finally, species occurrence and composition were assessed using R. ITS2 sequences were found in the majority (89%) of larval samples. Sequencing yielded an average of 140 (26 to 503) reads per sample. The OTUs were assigned to 28 different taxa, of which all but three could be identified as species. The average relative abundance of the seven most abundant species (all Cyathostominae) accounted for 87% of the combined data set. The three species with the highest prevalence in both horse groups were Cyathostomum catinatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus and Cylicostephanus calicatus, and they were frequently found in different combinations with other species regardless of horse group. Interestingly, this result is largely consistent with a previous Swedish study based on morphological analysis of adult worms. In addition, two migratory strongylids (Strongylus vulgaris and S. edentatus) occurred in few domestic horses and trotters. Except for C. minutus and C. nassatus, which decreased with age, and C. catinatum and S. vulgaris, which increased, no specific trends were observed with respect to horse age. Taken together, these results are broadly consistent with data obtained before the introduction of selective targeted treatment in Sweden in 2007. All in all, our results suggest that this treatment strategy has not led to a significant change in strongyle nematode community structure in Swedish horses. The study also confirms that nemabiome analysis in combination with diversity index analysis is an objective method to study strongyle communities in horses. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The work is the first comprehensive analysis of equine pathological changes from the Polish territory. The research material was collected from 20 archaeological sites, mainly early medieval settlements, such as strongholds, settlements, towns and horse graves. In the material examined, 186 cases of lesions were found. Of these, 26.9% were lesions of the spine, 39.8% lesions of the limb skeleton and 31.7% lesions of the head including dental pathologies. Most of the lesions in the limbs involved their distal segments. The vast majority of pathological cases can be linked to animal use. It was found that horses in which pathological lesions were observed were used under cover. In one case, the observed cranial trauma was the cause of death associated with injury to the nasal auricles and large vessels and consequent blood loss and possible shock. It was found that, in some of the cases, the horses started to be used early which affected their organs of motion and spine. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The subject of this study is a 3-year-old horse with a contractual flexor deformity of both thoracic limbs with a predominance of the left limb. Infrared thermography was conducted, and the radiographs regarding the musculoskeletal system assessment were reviewed. Congenital flexural limb deformities are a well-known group of developmental orthopedic diseases that can be effectively treated if diagnosed early. Our study aims to evaluate the degree of permanent changes in a patient not promptly treated and to compare thermography results to x-ray findings. The radiograph analysis revealed extensive pathological changes in both the passive and active locomotor systems. Thermography also showed some changes but was unable to predict whether the affected limbs would be able to recover. © 2024 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Forestry.

ABSTRACT: Eutrophication assessments in water management to quantify nutrient loads and identify mitigating measures seldom include the contribution from horse facilities. This may be due to lack of appropriate methods, limited resources, or the belief that the impact from horses is insignificant. However, the recreational horse sector is growing, predominantly in multi-functional peri-urban landscapes. We applied an ecosystem management approach to quantify nutrient loads from horse facilities in the Stockholm Region, Sweden. We found that horses increased the total loads with 30–40% P and 20–45% N, with average area-specific loads of 1.2 kg P and 7.6 kg N ha−1 year−1. Identified local risk factors included manure management practices, trampling severity, soil condition and closeness to water. Comparisons of assessment methods showed that literature standard values of area-specific loads and water runoff may be sufficient at the catchment level, but in small and more complex catchments, measurements and local knowledge are needed. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Speed alterations affect many gait analysis parameters. How horses adapt to speed is relevant in many equestrian disciplines and may differ between breeds. This study described changes in gait parameters in 38 Warmblood (WB) and 24 Franches-Montagnes (FM) horses subjected to an incremental speed test at walk (1.35–2.05 m/s) and trot (3.25–5.5 m/s). Time, force and spatial parameters of each limb were measured with an instrumented treadmill and analysed with regression analysis using speed as the independent variable. With higher speeds, stride rate, length, over-tracking distance and vertical ground reaction forces increased while the impulses decreased. The parameters followed the same linear or polynomial regression curves independent of breed, while the slope (linear) or incurvation (polynomial) often differed significantly between breeds. Some differences between the breeds were associated with height and speed (e.g. stride length at walk), and would disappear when scaling the data. The main differences between the breeds seem to stem from the movement of the hind limbs, with the FM obtaining long over-tracking distances despite the shorter height at withers. Some parameters relevant to gait quality could be improved in the FM to resemble WB movement by strict selection using objective measurements systems. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The evolving research methods and tools, along with the archived historical data, shed new light on the domestication process and origin of horses in North America. According to previous theories, horses became extinct in that region, and their current presence could only be attributed to the colonization by conquistadors. Contrary to these speculations, genetic data, primarily from well-preserved dental and jaw structures, indicate that the evolution of horses was of a polyphyletic nature. Traditional oral accounts, which challenge reports from the first European settlers, are now carefully analysed. This article is a synthetic analysis of literature concerning the domestication process of horses. It suggests that the thesis about the reintroduction of horses to both Americas may be flawed and needs revision. It presents a completely new picture of the direction of equid migration, beyond the already known overland route through the Land Bridge of Beringia. Additionally, it reveals possible new human-horse relationships associated with the domestication and expansion of only certain lineages of this species. This opens the possibility of a new interpretation of historical data and suggests new research areas. © 2024 Polskie Towarzystwo Nauk Weterynaryjnych. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Striatal dopamine is a neurotransmitter that marks reward and mediates reward learning. Spontaneous Eye Blink Rate (SEBR) reflects striatal dopamine activity and could offer a novel, proxy measure of learning performance. Additionally, arousal affects performance in a range of cognitive tasks, but there is less evidence for the relationship between baseline arousal and learning. This study investigated whether SEBR predicts learning performance in an equine model. Further, it investigated novel physiological predictors of learning performance (eye temperature and heart rate variability). Nineteen horses completed a two-choice discrimination reversal learning (RL) task. Performance was measured using a Performance Index. SEBR and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) were measured at rest (home stable) and during RL. Infrared Thermography of eye temperature (IRT) was measured immediately before and after RL. SEBR did not change in response to RL despite being thought to reflect striatal dopamine activity. HRV was higher during RL than at rest though was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Additionally, eye temperature decreased significantly during trials (left eye: p = 0.002; right eye: p = 0.05). These results indicate lower arousal in response to training, possibly similar to a ‘flow state’ in humans. Results of a negative binomial GLM revealed that SEBR was not associated with performance, however, positive predictors of learning performance included resting HRV (p = 0.009), HRV during the task (p = 0.002), and left eye temperature change (p < 0.0001). The association between left eye temperature and learning performance is consistent with lateralised blood flow to the left-brain hemisphere (responsible for learning targeted responses) and thought to be the first observation of this phenomenon during learning. Lower arousal may facilitate left-hemisphere dominance, creating the cognitive space to respond adaptively in RL. Left hemispheric dominance controls parasympathetic activity, potentially explaining the interactions observed here. Results suggest arousal both in the home and training environment may have important impacts on learning. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The study assessed the role of equids at slaughter as faecal carriers of Salmonella enterica and the occurrence of contaminated equid carcasses during the slaughter process in Northern Italy (Emilia-Romagna Region). From June to November 2021, 152 equids (146 horses, 5 donkeys and 1 mule) were tested for Salmonella both in caecal contents and through carcass swabs. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of recovered strains was tested against 15 antimicrobials. Salmonella was detected in 3/152 of the caecal contents (2.0 %), while all carcass samples were negative. S. enterica serovars Enteriditis, Typhimurium and Stanleyville were identified. The only AMR isolate was S. Typhimurium with AMR profile AmCStxT. Considering the consumption of raw horse meat (i.e., minced raw meat named “pesto di cavallo” and dried and smoked strips named “sfilacci di cavallo”) in different areas of Northern Italy, we also investigated the possible link between horse meat eating and salmonellosis cases in the human population in the same area. Specifically, we compared the Salmonella strains collected during the study with those routinely processed in the laboratory surveillance system for human salmonellosis in Emilia-Romagna (a region with about 4.5 million inhabitants). The comparison was based on whole genome sequencing data through core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) used in routine surveillance. A genomic match in cgMLST was found between the strain of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis isolated from a horse caecal content and an enduring outbreak of 17 human cases in Emilia-Romagna during the study period. The consequent epidemiological investigation highlighted that a number of cases with known food history reported the consumption of horse meat and traced different batches of the consumed meat, released weeks apart from each other, to the slaughter investigated in the study. The results of the epidemiological investigation suggested the role of horses in the S. enterica serovar Enteritidis outbreak affecting raw horse meat consumers. This study shows that, despite the low prevalence on equid carcasses, S. enterica in horse meat can represent a risk to consumers. From the perspective of the slaughter activities, this highlights the need to maintain a high level of hygiene during the entire process, starting from the hygiene at lairage up to the slaughtering phase and dressing of carcasses. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In 2019, a Swedish outbreak of equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV-1) led to varying neurological symptoms also known as EHM (equine herpes myeloencephalopathy). Nineteen of the 39 exposed horses developed EHM. EHM outbreaks have become more common in recent decades and can result in large economic losses for the horse industry in addition to clear welfare implications. However, there is limited information about the estimated time to recovery from EHM and return to previous level of performance and there is limited published information regarding neurological rehabilitation in horses. Our objective was to describe and evaluate the potential benefit of implementing individual rehabilitation plans for horses recovering from EHM. Four horses with EHV-1 and with clinical signs of neurological dysfunction were selected. All horses were initially hospitalised at an intensive care unit between 4 and 9 days and approximately 3 months after the outbreak they were considered sufficiently recovered to start a rehabilitation programme. The programs mainly focused on regaining proprioception, core stability and strength with consideration given to fatigue in the horse and risk to the handlers. A repeated neurological examination was performed six times over the first year and the rehabilitation programs were modified accordingly. The owners considered the horses ‘normal’, both mentally and physically, between 6 and 8 months after the outbreak. All horses were back to their previous level of performance after 8–11 months. A limitation of the study was a small study population with no control group. Our conclusions are that horses suffering from severe EHM may return to an acceptable athletic function given time and an individually adapted rehabilitation program. To potentially show that an individually adapted rehabilitation plan brings the horse back to acceptable function faster than nonspecific rehabilitation, a case-control study would be required. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This case report describes the poisoning of two mares from the same paddock with Robinia pseudoacacia (Black locust) bark. The poisoning manifested itself by the sudden onset of weakness and fever with transient improvement after the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and fluids. After the initial stabilisation, the mares were left unattended overnight. One of them was found dead in the morning. The surviving mare developed colic and severe encephalopathy and had to be referred to the clinic. Blood tests revealed severe hyperammonaemia. After four days of symptomatic treatment, she fully recovered. Robinia pseudoacacia with bark freshly bitten off was found in the paddock. The necropsy of the dead mare revealed oedema of the brain and lungs, pleural haemorrhages, and hyperaemia and haemorrhages of the glandular mucosa of the stomach. The intestinal content was watery, without macroscopic findings of the bark. Due to the peracute onset in both mares at the same time, hyperammonaemia and paralytic ileus in the surviving mare, and the presence of Robinia pseudoacacia in the paddock, poisoning with this tree was highly suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by the microscopic findings of Robinia pseudoacacia bark tissue in the gastric content of the dead mare.  © 2024 The authors.

ABSTRACT: Salbutamol is a short-acting and selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist. Inhaled (IH) administration of salbutamol is widely used to control lower respiratory tract disease in horses. Here, we estimated the pharmacokinetic parameters of salbutamol after a single intravenous (IV) or IH administration in six horses, and we statistically analysed the detection times with various dosing regimens. Plasma and urine concentrations of salbutamol were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and data were modelled by using a nonlinear mixed effect model followed by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). With IH salbutamol, the maximum plasma concentration was 0.12 ± 0.06 ng/mL at 0.29 ± 0.17 h after administration. Typical values were, for clearance, 1.53 L/kg/h; distribution volume at steady state, 5.43 L/kg; terminal half-life, 6.06 h; IH bioavailability, 19.0%; and urine to plasma ratio, 2057. Statistically estimated 95th percentile detection times in the urine at levels below the international screening limit (0.5 ng/mL) proposed by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, as simulated in 5000 horses by MCS, were 44 h after 1.6 μg/kg q 24 and 54 h after 1.6 μg/kg q 4 h over a 3-day IH administration period. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Including Internet of Things (IoT) technology in horse-rearing management can potentially mitigate problems such as human resource shortages and time limitations in performing daily behavior monitoring. In this study, a small and inexpensive activity meter used to monitor dogs and cats (PLUS CYCLE®, JARMeC, Kanagawa, Japan) was used to monitor the daily behavior of horses. A study was performed to examine the suitability of the PLUS CYCLE® device for monitoring horses and to determine whether it could estimate horse behavior. The device was equipped with an accelerometer and was used to monitor Kiso horses in horse stalls and pastures after installing the devices at specific locations on headcollars and girths. The amount of activity from the accelerometer showed differences among the horses’ behavioral types (lying, standing, walking, and feeding) in the stall, suggesting that it functions in horses. In the pasture, the amount of activity was correlated with GPS movement speed. Then, we tried to establish restricted cubic spline regression models to predict the locomotion speed in the pasture based on the amount of activity, but the prediction accuracy was low. This study showed that PLUS CYCLE® can be used to monitor horse activity amount during the daily management of individual horses. However, to achieve higher precision in monitoring detailed behaviors, additional investigation and data pertaining to the amount of activity for each horse during rearing in different environments are needed. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: A 12-hour-old Brazilian Sport Horse foal, presenting signs of dysmaturity, was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, being hospitalized for nine days before euthanasia. Clinically, neurological signs such as difficulty in maintaining head posture, tetraparesis, and asymmetric ataxia were observed, raising suspicion of cervical vertebrae abnormalities. Radiographic analysis revealed occipitalization of the atlas with asymmetric fusion of the atlas to the occipital bone and dorsal luxation of the axis; all these findings were confirmed at necropsy. Additionally, histopathology revealed axonal degeneration at spinal cord and pons as a result of nervous tissue compression at the atlantooccipital fusion area. Congenital occipitoatlantoaxial malformation (OAAM) was the definitive diagnosis in this case, and, to the best of our knowledge, it is described for the first time on a Brazilian Sport Horse. © 2024, Brazilian Association of Veterinary Pathology.

ABSTRACT: Prompt diagnosis of equine septic arthritis is crucial for successful treatment. Serum amyloid A (SAA) has been suggested as a reliable biomarker. However, we previously found that synovial fluid SAA increases in nonaffected joints of horses with septic arthritis. We hypothesized that systemic SAA may leak into the nonaffected joints. If this is the case, we also hypothesized that locally produced joint SAA isoforms may be better candidates for septic arthritis biomarkers. Thus, our objectives were 1) to evaluate the temporal kinetics of systemic and synovial fluid SAA in horses with septic arthritis (n = 5), non-septic synovitis (n = 5), and systemic inflammation (n = 5), examining both affected and contralateral joints; and 2) investigate putative locally produced joint SAA isoforms and detect amino-acid differences between them. We confirmed that SAA increases significantly in synovial fluid in nonaffected joints of horses with systemic inflammation (≤352 mg/L), as well as in contralateral nonaffected joins in horses with septic arthritis (≤1,830 mg/L) compared to baseline at time 0 (<0.2 mg/L). We also identified a putative locally produced joint SAA peptide in synovial fluid (FGDSGHGAADSR) that differed in 1 amino acid from 2 systemic peptides found both in plasma and synovial fluid. The putative joint SAA isoform was present in joints of horses with both septic arthritis and systemic inflammation (ion intensities 104–106). Thus, the increase of synovial fluid SAA may be both due to the leakage of SAA from serum into joints and local production of joint SAA isoforms. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A two-year-old male Japanese draft horse (known as a “Ban’ei horse”) excreted eight cestodes. Based on their morphological features, they were identified as Anoplocephala perfoliata. The partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences of the worms were nearly identical to A. perfoliata isolated from horses in Europe. The results of phylogenetic analyses of COI revealed that our samples and the European isolates formed the same clade, which was separate from Chinese and Australian isolates. Ban’ei horses were developed by crossbreeding draft horses imported from European countries in the 1900s. Our results suggest that A. perfoliata was transported to Hokkaido with horses from Europe. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. perfoliata infection in a Japanese draft horse. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: Effective communication and bonding between species rely on understanding the emotional states and expressive behaviours of one another. This is especially crucial in human-horse relationships, as misinterpreting horses’ communicative signals can easily result in serious injuries [1]. Understanding horses’ body language is essential for humans to build trust and improve interactions [2]. The objective of the research was to evaluate the fears of Holstein breed horses and their reactions to humans. Each horse was evaluated individually, without any limitations or restrictions. To evaluate the horses’ fear and reactivity toward humans, three behavioural tests were performed: 1st test (voluntary approach test), 2nd test (avoidance distance measurement test) and 3rd test (physical contact tolerance test) [2–3]. Additionally, reactions to stimuli during interactions with humans were observed. These tests also served to assess the horses’ body language and temperament. Two evaluators took part in all tests, and the impact of human gender on the horses’ fears and reactivity was examined. The statistical analysis of the data was performed using the SPSS 25.0 programme. The Spearman correlation was used to detect the linear relationship between investigated traits. The differences in the means of variables were analysed by the Student t-test. A probability of less than 0.05 was significant (P < 0.05). The results of the horse body language test showed that the horses responded equally to both men and women. The average temperament of horses interacting with evaluators of different genders showed tendency to be 0.8 points higher with male evaluator (P > 0.05). After analysing the relationships between the evaluators and the horses’ voluntary approach to different genders, it was found that the average time for horses to approach a woman was 74 seconds shorter than the time taken to approach a man; meanwhile, horse avoidance distance measurements showed consistent results: 83.3% of horses exhibited no significant avoidance (< 1 m) towards both a female evaluator and a male evaluator. The interrelationships regarding the physical touch of the tested horses and evaluators of different genders revealed that the average tolerance for physical contact with men was 0.17 points higher than with women (r = 0.857, P < 0.01); while the horses’ reactions to a sudden stimulus revealed a tendency that horses responded, on average, 7.49 seconds faster to the stimulus from a man than they did when the same stimulus was presented by a woman (P?> 0.05). © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija).

ABSTRACT: Background: Exercising arrhythmias can be clinically irrelevant or associated with poor performance, collapse and sudden cardiac death. Objectives: To test if readable exercising ECGs can be recorded by grooms or riders and to describe arrhythmias in ECGs from different types of exercise in Eventing horses and investigate associations with type of workout, the presence of previous cardiac signs and intensity of exercise. Study design: Cohort study. Methods: Single lead exercising ECGs were obtained by riders or grooms during training and competition from a convenience sample of horses in training for Eventing competitions. Arrhythmias were described, and associations between different arrhythmia categories and variables that described the horse and the workouts were sought. Results: There were 1002 ECGs from 62 horses (median [range] 7 [2–97] ECGs/horse) evaluated and 737 workouts (73.6%) were >95% readable and included in the analysis. There were arrhythmias in 250 (33.9%) of the workouts, complex arrhythmias in 13 (1.8%) and the number of premature complexes was median (range) 0 (0–118). Peak heart rate and duration of exercise were associated with the number of premature complexes, the presence of arrhythmias and complex arrhythmias and were colinear with the type of exercise. Having previous signs of cardiac disease and the type of workout were associated with higher odds of having arrhythmias. Conclusions: Monitoring the rhythm of equine athletes with ECGs obtained by riders and transmitted to an online cloud was feasible. Arrhythmias were frequent, and complex arrhythmias were rare. The presence of cardiac signs, type of exercise and peak heart rate were associated with the presence of arrhythmias. None of the horses developed poor performance or collapse attributed to cardiac disease. The arrhythmias that should be concerning for equine veterinarians need further definition. © 2024 The Author(s). Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of essential oil (EO) supplementation on insulin sensitivity (IS) and the plasma metabolome in insulin dysregulated (ID) horses. Horses were blocked by degree of IS and assigned randomly to treatment: oral daily bolus (50 mL) of either a plant derived EO supplement or carrier (CON). Mares were housed in dry lots with ad libitum access to grass hay and supplemented individually twice daily with a concentrate to meet nutrient requirements for mature horses. Before and after 6 wks of treatment, mares underwent a combined glucose-insulin tolerance test (CGIT) and an oral sugar test (OST) on separate days. Global metabolome analysis was conducted on plasma samples before and after treatment. Although treatment did not affect (p > 0.4) AUC or glucose clearance during CGIT, there was a treatment*covariate interaction (p ≤ 0.08) for insulin concentrations at 75 min (INS75) and positive phase time (PT) with EO decreasing both INS75 (p ≤ 0.002) and PT (p = 0.05) in horses with more severe initial degree of ID. Similarly, EO treatment reduced (p ≤ 0.006) insulinemic response to the OST in horses exhibiting higher pre-treatment responses (treatment*covariate, p = 0.004). There were 702 metabolites identified that were uniquely changed with EO treatment. Pathway analysis and biomarkers showed EO-mediated changes in amino acid, linoleic acid, mesaconic acid, TCA-cyle intermediates and bile acid metabolism. The directional changes in these pathways or biomarkers are consistent with changes in inulin sensitivity in other models. These data show that EO shifted the plasma metabolome and improved insulin sensitivity in horses. Copyright © 2024 Loos, Zhao, Li, Li, Han, Vanzant and McLeod.

ABSTRACT: Background: A proportion of senior horses (≥15 years of age) are still used for competition. Information about this particular group of horses is currently sparse. Objectives: To provide an overview of the demographics, management and health of competing U.S. senior horses (≥15 years of age). Study design: Online survey. Methods: Descriptive and inferential (Kruskal–Wallis test) analysis of 246 surveys from owners of U.S.-resident senior horses used for competition. Confidence intervals were calculated for prevalence estimates of clinical signs and medical conditions. Results: Competing senior horses were mainly kept at their owners' own facility, with owners making all management decisions (52.2%). In terms of housing, competing senior horses were most frequently kept in a stall but with ≥12 h a day on pasture. Competing seniors were predominantly 15–20 years of age (73.4%), were geldings (69.5%) and were Quarter Horses (33.5%). About one-half competed/trained for competition at a medium level. Three percent competed at the highest (e.g., international) level. The most common discipline was dressage (32.0%). Stiffness/reduced leg-joint flexibility was the most common owner-reported clinical sign (29.2%; 95% CI: 23.5–35.6) and osteoarthritis was the most common owner-reported veterinary-diagnosed medical condition (32.6%; 95% CI: 26.8–39.0), followed by gastric ulcers (8.0%; 95% CI: 5.1–12.3) and lameness (7.6%; 95% CI: 4.8–11.8). Nearly one-half (43.3%) indicated that their competing senior horse had no veterinary-diagnosed medical condition at the time of the survey. Main limitations: Potential recall, response and sampling bias. Conclusions: Although few horses over 20 years of age were used in competition, senior horses (≥15 years of age) competed up to the highest level (e.g., internationally) in some disciplines. Competing senior horses were affected by medical conditions commonly reported in the general senior horse population (e.g., osteoarthritis and lameness) and younger competing horses (e.g., gastric ulcers and lameness), potentially increasing the complexity of their management. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Identifying factors that drive among-individual variation in mixed parasitic infections is fundamental to understanding the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions. However, a lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools to quantify mixed infections has restricted their investigation for host populations in the wild. This study applied DNA metabarcoding on parasite larvae cultured from faecal samples to characterize mixed strongyle infections of 320 feral horses on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, in 2014 to test for the influence of host (age, sex and reproductive/social status) and environmental (location, local density and social group membership) factors on variation. Twenty-five strongyle species were identified, with individual infections ranging from 3 to 18 species with a mean richness (±1 S.D.) of 10.8 ± 3.1. Strongyle eggs shed in faeces were dominated by small strongyle (cyathostomins) species in young individuals, transitioning to large strongyles (Strongylus spp.) in adults. Egg counts were highest in young individuals and in the west or centre of the island for most species. Individuals in the same social group had similar parasite communities, supporting the hypothesis that shared environment may drive parasite assemblages. Other factors such as local horse density, sex, date and reproductive/social status had minimal impacts on infection patterns. This study demonstrates that mixed infections can be dynamic across host ontogeny and space and emphasizes the need to consider species-specific infection patterns when investigating mixed infections. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Equine piroplasmosis is an apicomplexan hemoprotozoan-caused disease that affects equids worldwide. Horses that survive piroplasmosis can become asymptomatic carriers for the rest of their lives. The present study aimed to determine the frequency of piroplasms and to compare three different blood smear tests (jugular, peripheral, and splenic blood) to detect piroplasms in asymptomatic wandering horses seized by the "Secretaria de Estado da Agricultura, Abastecimento e Desenvolvimento Rural do Distrito Federal" (SEAGRIDF), Midwest region of Brazil. Of the 100 horses evaluated, 38 were diagnosed positive for piroplasm (38%), with the etiological agents found at the jugular blood smear in 11% (11/100) of horses, peripheral blood smear in 13% (13/100), and splenic blood smear in 38% (38/100). Piroplasm-positive horses showed anemia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia, but the hematological changes did not differ statistically between positive and negative horses. In summary, the stray horses evaluated showed a high incidence of piroplasm (38%). All positive horses presented one of the etiologic agents in the splenic blood, but some did not show the parasite in the jugular blood smear (27/38, 71%) or the peripheral blood smear (25/38, 65.8%). Thus, the splenic blood was shown to be the best sample to determine the presence of piroplasm in wandering horses. As it is a low-cost and easy-to-perform test, it can be included in the routine diagnosis of equine piroplasmosis, helping to monitor the prevalence of piroplasms in places where molecular techniques are not accessible. © 2024 Colegio Brasileiro de Patologia Animal.

ABSTRACT: Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), also known as dimethyl sulfone, is a naturally occurring sulphur-containing compound that can be found in plants, animals and humans. MSM can also be a metabolite of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Due to their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, both MSM and DMSO are prohibited substances in horseracing. As both substances are naturally occurring, their misuse in horses is controlled by International Residue Limits (IRL) of 1200 and 15 μg/mL, respectively, in horse urine as established by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. The elimination of DMSO in horses has been reported; however, there has been no report on the elimination of MSM in horses. This paper describes a pilot study of an administration study of MSM in two geldings following one scoop (~15 g) of Pure MSM twice daily for six consecutive days. MSM in post-administration urine and blood samples was quantified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry after sample dilution, with additional protein precipitation for the blood samples. The elimination profiles of MSM in urine and blood are described. The maximum detection time in urine at the IRL of 1200 μg/mL was around 4.5 days after the last dose. Plasma MSM in both horses was around 120 μg/mL at 4.4 days after the last dose, which was the last blood sample collected. As such, 120 μg/mL may indicate a possible IRL for controlling MSM in horse blood. The analysis of DMSO in post-MSM-administration samples showed that DMSO is not a significant metabolite of MSM in horses. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Dental disease is a common but often under-recognised condition in horses, possibly due to an inability to recognise clinical signs of oral discomfort. Some dental disorders are reportedly more painful than others, but there is no current metric by which dental pain can be objectively assessed. This study aimed to determine whether a facial expression-based pain scale offered an objective and reliable method for assessing dental pain in horses. It was hypothesised that dental disorders affecting the periodontium would produce high pain scores. Methods: Twelve horses with dental disease were evaluated for pain using a numerical rating scale (NRS) and a horse grimace scale (HGS) by blinded observers using still, lateral photographs. Results: Interobserver reliability was poor across all observers when both the NRS (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.36) and the HGS (ICC = 0.27) were used in horses with dental disease. The highest mean scores were given for horses with equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) and periodontal disease (PD). Limitations: This study has a small sample size of both horses and questionnaire respondents, and the respondent demographics are not representative of the wider veterinary population Furthermore, no positive or negative controls were used for the pain scoring. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate the unreliability of tools designed for identifying acute pain for assessing chronic pain, such as dental pain. A more dental-specific ethogram is required to accurately identify dental pain in horses. Both the NRS and HGS produced the highest mean scores for EOTRH and PD, supporting existing literature that these conditions are associated with more obvious signs of pain. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Gait visual scores are widely applied to horse breeding because they are a fast and easy phenotyping strategy, allowing the numeric interpretation of a complex biological process such as gait quality. However, they may suffer from subjectivity or high environmental influence. We aimed to investigate potential causal relationships among six visual gait scores in Campolina horses. The data included 5475 horses with records for at least one of the following traits: Dissociation (Di), Comfort (C), Style (S), Regularity (R), Development (De), and Gait total Scores (GtS). The pedigree comprised three generations with 14,079 horses in the additive relationship matrix. Under a Bayesian framework, (co)variance components were estimated through a multitrait animal model (MTM). Then, the inductive causation algorithm (IC) was applied to the residual (co)variance matrix samples. The resulting undirected graph from IC was directed in 6 possible causal structures, each fitted by a structural equation model. The final causal structure was chosen based on deviance information criteria (DIC). It was found that S significantly impacts the causal network of gait, directly and indirectly affecting C. The indirect causal effect of S on C was through the direct effect of S on De, then the direct effect of De on R, and finally, the direct effect of R on C. Di was caused by S, which is the reason for the genetic correlation between Di and GtS, due to causal effects being added to the model, they absorb the genetic correlation between Di and GtS. Those paths have biological meaning to horse movements and can help breeders and researchers better understand horses' complex causal network of gait. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The article is devoted to the influence of natural antioxidants on the quality parameters of meat semi-finished products from horse meat and the microbiological stability of the product during its storage. In solving the set tasks, the standard, generally accepted methods of research were used. Statistical processing of the obtained results and assessment of data reliability were carried out by statistical methods using Microsoft Excel and Statistica (version 12.0). A new antioxidant of natural origin, dihydroquercetin, has been proposed and tested. Effective doses of its application have been established: 0.05 - 0.075% for raw horse fat and 0.075% for semi-finished meat products from horse meat produced with its addition. It has been shown that the administration of dihydroquercetin (Dx) together with ascorbic acid (AA) and tocopherol (Tp) is 10–30% more effective. The effect of dihydroquercetin on the indicators of oxidative spoilage in the technological process, from the production of horse meat to finished products using the latter, has been studied. The organoleptic parameters (appearance, odour, colour) of the control sample and the sample with 0.025% Dx by fat weight corresponded in their characteristics to the experimental samples with 0.05%, 0.075% and 0.1% by 45 days of storage. The introduction of dihydroquercetin, ascorbic acid, and tocopherol also makes it possible to slow down the microbiological spoilage of the semi-finished products that have been obtained during storage. © (2024), (HACCP Consulting).

ABSTRACT: Despite the long history of the horse-human bond, our understanding of the brain and mind of horses remains limited due to the lack of methods to investigate their brain functions. This study introduces a novel methodology for completely non-invasive, multi-channel recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials in awake horses to examine equine auditory cortical processing. The new approach utilizes specially designed brush-shaped active electrodes that facilitate stable signal acquisition through the hair coat by penetrating electrode pins and integrated pre-amplifiers. A 12-channel electrode array provided greater scalp coverage than prior work. As a proof of concept, clear cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded in response to sound onsets and offsets. The equine CAEP waveform morphology resembled the human P1-N1-P2-N2 complex, although the latencies were shorter than typical human values. The CAEP amplitudes were maximal at centroparietal electrodes, contrasting with the frontocentral distribution seen in humans, potentially explained by differences in auditory cortex orientation between species. This non-invasive multi-electrode method enables the evaluation of cognitive abilities, normal and abnormal brain functions, and advances scientific understanding of the equine mind. It offers potential widespread applications for recording EEGs and evoked potentials in awake horses and other medium-to-large mammalian species.

ABSTRACT: Background: Sinus gas expansion is a rare condition in equine patients, resulting in progressive deformity of the facial bones. The condition is sparsely documented in veterinary literature. Similar lesions are categorised as sinus pneumocele or pneumosinus dilatans in human patients, based on the presence or absence of sinus wall erosion. Objectives: To describe imaging findings in horses with gas expansion of the paranasal sinuses. Study design: Multicentric retrospective descriptive case series. Methods: Horses with a computed tomographic (CT) description of sinus gas expansion were included. Computed tomography changes were described, and lesions were categorised as sinus pneumocele or pneumosinus dilatans. Signalment, history and clinical signs were recorded, as well as radiological signs, histology and follow-up information, when available. Results: Eight horses met the inclusion criteria, including seven diagnosed with sinus pneumocele and one with pneumosinus dilatans. Clinical signs were variable, depending on the affected bones and sinuses. The conchofrontal sinus was the most frequently affected. Irregular sinus wall erosion, marginal separation of the bone diploe and abnormal septation were consistent imaging findings in horses with sinus pneumocele. Active bone remodelling was confirmed by histology in one patient. Based on CT, the sinus mucosa was thickened adjacent to the sinus wall erosion in 5/7 patients, with hazy dystrophic mineralisation in three horses. One horse had a follow-up CT at 26 months, showing progression of the lesion. The horse with pneumosinus dilatans had minor facial bone deformity and severe gas expansion of all left-sided paranasal sinuses, largely encroaching on the right paranasal sinuses, without bone erosion. Conclusion: Diagnostic imaging and more particularly CT is valuable for identifying and characterising abnormal gas expansion of the paranasal sinuses in horses. Based on this small case series, the condition is slowly progressive and inconsistently associated with clinical signs. Its pathophysiology remains unclear, warranting further exploration. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Long-loop rodeo is a major competition for Criollo horses. We aimed to feature long-loop tournaments and to assess the profiles of competing horses. The animals (n = 49) were registered, and their body mass/scores, information about breeding, feeding, and training management, loaded weight, and tournament track (n = 11) were collected; speeds reached were estimated. Heart and respiratory rates of horses (n = 27) were collected before the tournament, on the final day of the event, and 18-24 h after the end of the tournament. Blood samples were collected from the animals at the same time. Blood count (n = 19) and biochemical profile (n = 28) were conducted based on total proteins, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Data were assessed using analysis of variance in association with Tukey’s test (P ≤0.05) and Spearman’s correlation (P ≤0.05). Most horses were bred in a semi-stable system, fed roughage and concentrate, and subjected to non-standardized training. The tournament comprised a high-intensity and short-duration exercise with a mean speed of 6.44 m/s, during which the horses carried 25.59% of their body weight on their backs. Clinical evaluations and hematological and biochemical assessments in this study showed physiological changes caused by exercise. Copyright Pereira et al.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated the clinical efficacy of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol– ketamine–xylazine (PKX) with or without remifentanil for castration in horses. Twentyfour Thoroughbred horses were premedicated with intravenous (IV) xylazine (1.0 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) and anesthetized with IV ketamine (1.5 mg/kg) and propofol (1.0 mg/kg). Surgical anesthesia was maintained with constant infusion of propofol (3.0 mg/kg/hr)–ketamine (3.0 mg/kg/hr)–xylazine (1.0 mg/kg/hr) (group PKX: n=8), PKX combined with remifentanil (3.0 µg/kg/hr) (group PKXR3: n=8), or PKX combined with remifentanil (6.0 µg/kg/hr) (group PKXR6: n=8). During anesthesia, none of the horses showed any limb movements, but five, two, and two horses in the PKX, PKXR3, and PKXR6 groups, respectively, showed cremaster muscle contractions. One horse in the PKX group required doubling the PKX infusion rate to continue surgery. Adverse effects of remifentanil (trembling of the nose tip or tongue) were observed in one and three horses in the PKXR3 and PKXR6 groups, respectively. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were well maintained in all groups. Ventilation was assisted in four, five, and six horses in the PKX, PKXR3, and PKXR6 groups, respectively. Recovery scores in the PKX group were fair in one horse, good in three horses, and excellent in four horses, whereas recovery in all horses in the PKXR3 and PKXR6 groups was judged to be excellent. TIVA with PKX combined with remifentanil 3.0 µg/kg/hr could provide more sufficient anesthetic depth than PKX with fewer clinically significant adverse effects than that with remifentanil 6.0 µg/kg/hr. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: A breeding program has been developed for the Latvian warmblood heavy type horses in Latvia, with the aim to preserve this type, because the number of these horses is small and the status of the local endangered breed has been granted. The aim of the study was to analyse the genetic structure, inbreeding and effective population size of the Latvian warmblood heavy type (LSB) horse population. Horses that were living at the time of the study on January 1, 2023 were used for the study. A total of 374 genetic resources live horses were analysed. Population structure analysis, inbreeding and effective population size were investigated. Calculations were done by POPREP (v1.0) software. The effective population size (Ne) decreased, however, since 2018 the decline in the size of the effective population has not been so rapid. In 2000, the Ne was 316 animals, and in 2020, it was 101 animals. Over the years, changes in the average inbreeding level in the LSB population were observed from year to year. In 2000, inbreeding was 1.39%, and in 2020 it was 1.47% with the average inbreeding level of 1.12%. Over the last 20 years, large changes in Ne have been observed, thus, the loss of genetic diversity in the LSB breed should be controlled. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Platelet lysate (PL) demonstrates antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties offering potential for treatment of bacterial pneumonia in horses. It remains unknown whether nebulization is suitable for PL administration in horses. This pilot study characterized particle size and flow rate of pooled equine PL (single preparation) nebulized using an equine-specific nebulizer (Flexivent®). Methods: Protein composition and antimicrobial activity were compared before and after nebulization. Protein composition was evaluated according to growth factor, antimicrobial peptide and cytokine concentrations and proteomic analysis. To evaluate antimicrobial activity, bacterial growth inhibition [maximum growth (μmax); carrying capacity (K)] were determined for E. coli, Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus and Rhodococcus equi (WT and MDR) using pre- and post-nebulized PL concentrations of 50%. Results: Flow rate and median particle size were 0.8 ml/min and 4.991 μm with 52% of particles ≤ 5 μm. Differences in PL protein composition were detected with nebulization. For E. coli and S. zooepidemicus, nebulization did not alter effect of PL on growth parameters. PL treatments decreased K for S. zooepidemicus (p = 0.009) compared to BHI. For R. equi K was increased post- vs. pre-nebulization (WT and MDR) and μmax increased pre- vs, post-nebulization (MDR). PL treatments increased K and μmax for MDR R. equi and μmax for WT R. equi compared to BHI (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: Nebulization of PL in vitro is technically feasible. The results of this study support further investigation to better characterize the effect of nebulization on PL and its suitability for nebulization in horses.

ABSTRACT: Sustained atrial tachycardia at an atrial rate of 191/min on the surface ECG was detected in a 6-year-old Warmblood mare. The vectorcardiogram obtained from a 12-lead ECG suggested a caudo-dorsal right atrial origin of the arrhythmia. Impedance-based three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping, using the EnSite™ Precision Cardiac Mapping System revealed a clockwise macro-reentry around a line of conduction block in the caudomedial right atrium. Ten radiofrequency applications were applied to isolate the caudal vena cava myocardial sleeves at a power of 35 W and mean contact force of 14 ± 3 g until a lesion size index of 6 was reached. Sinus rhythm was restored at the first energy application. Successful isolation was confirmed by demonstrating entrance and exit block. Holter monitoring 5 days post-ablation revealed no abnormalities. To date, 9 months after treatment, no recurrence has been observed. The use of lesion size index-guided ablation and isolation of the arrhythmogenic substrate in the caudal vena cava may minimise the risk of recurrence. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the environmental and economic impact of integrating hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) in horse farms to produce hydrochar with potential environmental and economic benefits as a fertilizer. The results indicate that HTC has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophication impacts compared to traditional methods. Despite the high CAPEX making the HTC integration economically unfeasible, the system can become viable if hydrochar is used instead of purchased fertilizers and if the capital investment is reduced by 54%. To realize these environmental and economic benefits, financial support to lower the initial investment will be required. In addition, further R&D and increased demand for small-to-medium scale HTC can reduce capital cost. © 2024, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Desmotomy of the accessory ligament of the superficial digital flexor tendon (AL-SDFT) has been described for the treatment of superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) tendinopathy in Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses, and in event horses. To our knowledge, the outcome of this procedure has not been described in a population of warmblood horses. Objective: To report on the outcome of treatment of SDFT tendinopathy in warmblood horses using tenoscopic desmotomy of the main part of the AL-SDFT. Study design: Prospective observational case series. Methods: All 62 horses included in the case series had uni- or bilateral SDFT tendinopathy within the metacarpal/carpal region. The following data were collected and analysed using crosstabulations: breed, age, sex, use, affected limb(s), duration of tendinopathy, lameness grade, type and size of the SDFT lesion, bi- or unilateral desmotomy, duration of surgery, intraoperative findings, intraoperative/post-operative complications, duration of hospitalisation and outcome 24 months after surgery. Results: Forty-six horses (75%) were sound with 31 (51%) of these horses performing at the same level as prior to injury. Recurrent SDFT injuries or persistent lameness was observed in 15 (25%) horses. Two horses (3%) developed septic tenosynovitis post-operatively, one required euthanasia. Horses with lesions in the proximal third of the SDFT had a better outcome than those with lesions in the two distal thirds (OR = 4.71, 95% CI = 1.33–16.70). Main Limitations: There were no control groups of horses with SDFT tendinopathy treated by conservative therapy, tenoscopic complete or conventional open desmotomy. Conclusions: Tenoscopic desmotomy of the main part of the AL-SDFT is a successful treatment for SDFT tendinopathy in warmblood horses, especially in proximal SDFT lesions. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background. Przewalski’s horse is included in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the Red Data Book of Ukraine as an endangered species. To confirm the uniqueness and consolidation of rare animal species, cytogenetic and molecular genetic monitoring is necessary. Obtaining biological material (blood) for genetic research is preceded by immobilization of wild ungulates. The successful selection of drugs for the purpose of sedation and analgesia helps to preserve the life and health of the animal. Materials and Methods. Przewalski’s wild horse population (10 heads) of the F. E. Falz-Fein “Askania-Nova” biosphere reserve, immobilization of animals with the Madison drug and the Reverson antidote, cytogenetic and molecular genetic (ISSR-fingerprinting) analysis. Results. The effectiveness indicators of doses of Madison and Reverson were: in horses m = 200 kg – a dose of Madison 20 mL/head, immobilization after 22 min, in horses m = 300 kg, a dose of Madison – 25 mL/head, immobilization in 20–22 min. The Reverson antidote was applied in the following doses: animal m = 200 kg – a dose of Reverson 5–15 mL/goal, cessation of the sedative effect – 12 min; animal m = 300 kg – a dose of Reverson 5–15 mL/goal, cessation of the sedative effect – 18 min. Observation of the effect of the drugs did not reveal any negative side effects. Cytogenetic analysis determined the karyotype norm of somatic cells with 2n = 66 chromosomes. Genomic disorders, aneuploidy, accounted for 6.7%, polyploidy – 1.3 %. Structural violations (chromosomal and chromatid breaks) were not detected. The results of the micronucleus test: the share of lymphocytes with a micronucleus – 3.0 ‰, binuclear lymphocytes – 2.3 ‰, mitotic index – 7.7 ‰. Genetic indicators of the population of Przewalski’s horses according to ISSR markers: when using (GA)9 C as a primer, microsatellite repeats of polymorphic loci were not found, and according to primer (GAG)6 C – 50 % of polymorphic loci. The main indicators of genetic diversity, with the help of ISSR markers: the share of polymorphic loci was 25 %, the average gene diversity per locus – 0.39, the Shannon–Wiener information index – 2.5. Conclusions. No negative side effects occur when Madison and Reverson drugs are used to immobilize Przewalski’s horses. According to the results of cytogenetic analy sis, the stability of the karyotype of the studied animals was established. The study of genetic polymorphism of the horse population by ISSR markers (AG)9C and (GAG)6C indicates a high degree of genetic consolidation. All tested animals are relatively safe according to the revealed intra-population genetic diversity. © 2024 Lyubov Starodub et al.

ABSTRACT: Two horses kept on different farms at a geographical distance of 150 km were presented with acute neurological dysfunction. Ante-mortem diagnostic tests including bloodwork, CT scan and cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not provide a diagnosis in either case. Due to rapid deterioration, both horses were euthanised shortly after admission. Postmortem histopathological examination revealed granulomatous meningoencephalitis with intralesional nematodes that were morphologically identified as Halicephalobus gingivalis. This is the first documentation of central nervous system infestation by H. gingivalis in horses residing in Belgium, emphasising the importance of considering aberrant parasitic migration in the differential diagnosis of acute neurological dysfunction. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cecocolic intussusceptions are a rare condition of acute colic in horses requiring immediate surgical intervention due to persistent uncontrollable pain and ongoing ischemic cecal necrosis. Particularly in cases where reduction of the intussusception is surgically not feasible surgical interventions such as partial typhlectomy through colotomy (partial cecal amputation) combined with or without cecal bypass techniques are described. Alternatively, surgical interventions can also be performed without partial typhlectomy via incomplete bypass ileocolostomy. Information regarding applicable techniques and outcomes base on sparse literature of single case reports or small case series. Therefore, this case series aims to add more cases treated with incomplete bypass ileocolostomy without typhlectomy to existing literature and to compare the outcome by reviewing medical records from January 2009 to March 2024 in context to literature. Five horses were surgically treated and were followed-up between 1 and 9 years. Minor short-term complications were recorded during hospitalization such as transient mild colic and febrile episodes. Long-term outcome revealed that horses received or exceed their previous level of use. By adding the hereby presented cases to published data horses treated with ileocolostomy without partial typhlectomy had a long-term survival rate of 100%. However, numbers of published cases are still low with 49 horses being included in the literature review whereof 42 recovered from surgery. The overall long-term survival rate was 53%. The added value of this study is based on the comprehensive documentation of a cohort of five horses successfully treated with an incomplete bypass procedure, demonstrating favorable long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the study advances the surgical technique by implementing the closure of mesenteric gap. The evidence for the application of the surgical technique has been strengthened.

ABSTRACT: Leading from a recent case when horses appeared to be given precedence over disabled people, this paper explores the tensions that disabled people often experience in public space. The presence of disabled people is chronically contested, monitored and questioned. Ableism plays a key role in determining where, when, what and how space is allocated. Alternative, non-disabling ways of proceeding are then suggested. © 2024 Royal Scottish Geographical Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: MicroRNA (miRNA) has previously been used as a biomarker for cardiac disease in humans and dogs, however, studies in horses are not yet available. Objectives: To determine if adult horses with moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation have a different serum miRNA expression profile compared to healthy controls. Study design: Retrospective cross-sectional. Methods: Serum samples from 77 adult horses with moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation and 77 healthy control horses were analysed using a commercial cardiac disease-specific miRNA panel previously used in dogs. Results: The commercial canine cardiac miRNA panel had low discriminatory power as a biomarker for mitral valve regurgitation in adult horses. Sensitivity was 0.58 (95% Cl: 0.47–0.69) and specificity 0.57 (95% Cl: 0.46–0.68). Main limitations: Clinical data were extracted retrospectively and currently there is no well-established criteria for grading mitral regurgitation in horses; there were few severe mitral regurgitation cases and the pathogenesis of mitral regurgitation was not considered. Controls were not matched by age, breed or sex. An assay developed for use in dogs was used. Conclusion: Despite strong miRNA conservation across species, the commercially available canine cardiac miRNA panel failed as biomarker for mitral valve regurgitation in adult horses. Further research is needed to determine if an equine specific panel can be developed that performs better as biomarker for cardiac disease in horses. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Horse behavior is highly diverse and influenced by multiple factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of selected factors on the frequency of social and comfort behavior in horses residing in a sandy paddock and pasture during different seasons. The study included a herd of 20 horses – 14 geldings and six mares. The youngest was three years old, the oldest was 21 years old, and the rest of the horses were in the 4 to 19 age range. The research involved observing the behavior of horses outside the stable, on the pasture and in a sandy paddock during four seasons. An ethogram was created to document specific social and comfort behavior. Weather conditions data for each day were collected using an anemometer. Statistically significant differences were observed in the occurrence of specific behavior between mares and geldings. The age of the horses did not affect the occurrence of specific behavior. Statistically significant correlations were found between weather conditions during the four seasons and the occurrence of social and comfort behavior. The research demonstrated that gender and weather conditions influence the occurrence of social and comfort behavior in horses. © 2024 Sciendo. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Chronic diarrhoea presents a diagnostic challenge for both human physicians and equine veterinarians. There is currently no consensus in the equine veterinary literature on the definition of chronic diarrhoea. The differential list is extensive and identifying diarrhoea by pathophysiologic mechanism can help remove less likely diagnoses. Achieving a definitive antemortem diagnosis is also challenging. Results from non-invasive diagnostics may only lead to the conclusion that inflammation is present. Cellular infiltrate, if present, may not be representative of the underlying disease. Invasive diagnostics resulting in acquisition of full-thickness biopsies may result in a diagnosis when other methods have failed. However, there is currently minimal data correlating these findings with those from full post-mortem examination. This article discusses the various diagnostic options and reviews the available literature on their value in evaluating currently available patients with chronic diarrhoea. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report a radical surgical technique for perianal melanomas involving the anal margin in standing horses. Study design: Observational retrospective study. Sample population: Twenty client-owned horses presented for surgical excision of extensive (≥4 cm) perianal melanomas. Methods: Demographic data, surgical technique, intraoperative, immediate- and late-postoperative complications were reviewed. Results: All horses (median age 15, Q1–Q3 12 to 17.3 years) were operated under standing sedation and epidural anesthesia. Median hospitalization period was 6.5 days (Q1–Q3 5 to 8.3 days). The anal margin was fully resected in 14 cases. A deep perirectal dissection was performed in 16 cases. Eight cases required additional local anesthetics. One case bled profusely during and after the procedure. One case became recumbent during the procedure, showed intense postoperative pain, and was eventually euthanized 6 weeks later because of ataxia. During hospitalization, one horse displayed colic signs and 10 others required manual evacuation of the rectum because of decreased fecal output. Complications after hospital discharge included mild colic signs (n = 4), partial wound dehiscence (n = 1) and hypergranulation of the wound (n = 2). All other cases healed without complications in 6 to 12 weeks. Median follow-up period was 11.8 months (Q1–Q3 6.3 to 27.2 months). Six horses developed new melanomas with only one in the perianal region. Conclusion: This technique of surgical excision of extensive perianal melanomas was efficiently performed on standing horses with minimal local recurrence. This procedure led to high client satisfaction. Early postoperative pain was commonly encountered. Owners should be warned of the potentially large surgical wound that will be created. Clinical significance: This technique allowed for removal of large perianal melanomas with limited recurrence during the long term follow up and may improve the quality of life of affected horses. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: This chapter explores equine sensory modalities, highlighting the distinct perceptual abilities of horses. As with humans, vision, hearing, olfaction, taste, and touch comprise the equine sensory apparatus and impact responses to the environment. However, differences in horse and human range and capacity necessitate an understanding of equine perception for positive horse-human interactions. Horses have a unique sensory landscape with panoramic visual abilities, superior aural capabilities, and a highly developed sense of smell. The importance of proper tactile stimulation, a communication channel used in daily interactions, is emphasized. The discussion extends to sensory enrichment techniques, proposing the use of odors, touch, and sound to enhance horse welfare. Factors like breed, individuality, age, and color further shape equine perception, stressing the need for tailored management strategies. As a crucial aspect of equitation science, understanding equine sensory abilities remains pivotal, urging continued scientific analysis for a holistic understanding of diverse equine needs. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The welfare of horses involved in sport and leisure activities has come under increasing scrutiny, both from within the equine sector and from the public. A systematic review of scientific evidence was conducted to derive observable, evidence-based behavioural measures of positive or negative affective state and factors relating to quality of life in the domestic horse (Equus caballus). Two separate searches (including the terms ‘emotion/affect’, or ‘stress’) were conducted, with 179 articles being retained. In Part I of this two-part review (companion paper published simultaneously), articles relating to the extent to which the species-specific needs of the horse are fulfilled in the home environment (n = 21), in relation to social grouping (n = 20), and during weaning (n = 14) were reviewed. Experimental tests of affective state in relation to housing and management (n = 8), and studies relating to stereotypical behaviour (n = 7) were also included. Opportunities for behavioural expression were dependent upon the provision of social and physical resources. Withdrawn or agitated behaviours in situ, avoidance behaviour during handling and agonistic intra-species interactions were indicative of negative affective state. Affiliative intra-specific social interactions, and forage ingestion were considered positive signs. For horses to live a good life, their need for space, companionship, and forage must be prioritised from birth and throughout their lives. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe the procedure and outcome of electrochemotherapy (ECT) with bleomycin as a first-line treatment for bilateral ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in the eye of a horse. Animal Studied: A client-owned 5-year-old Haflinger gelding with limbal-conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. Procedures: During general and local anesthesia, injection of bleomycin in the ocular tumor was followed by electroporation, applied with a 15 mm needle electrode, needles held parallel to the ocular surface. Results: Treatment with ECT resulted in therapeutic electric pulses and complete tumor response with no recurrence during follow-up. Tumor toxicity as a result of treatment was mild, with no adverse effect to normal tissue. Conclusions: In this case of bilateral ocular tumors, staged ECT with bleomycin was shown to be a safe and effective treatment with complete tumor remission and no recurrence during the observation period. The result suggests ECT as a possible treatment in ocular tumors, with further research recommended. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: Background: Impinging dorsal spinous processes (IDSP) are a common cause of pain and loss of performance in sports horses, with a range of surgical and conservative treatments available. Objectives: Identify relationships between treatment choice and the likelihood of returning to previous level of performance for horses diagnosed with IDSP. Study design: Cross-sectional survey of owners with horses diagnosed with IDSP. Methods: A 14-question online survey was circulated via social media. Data were collected for 260 horses and analysed for associations between treatment choice and return to pre-diagnosis level of performance. Results: Just under 50% of horses in the sample returned to their previous level of performance post-treatment. Horses that were treated surgically had twice the odds of returning to their previous level than those that were not, and horses that underwent an exercise rehabilitation programme had 10 times the odds of returning to level. Main limitations: As this was an owner survey, self-selection bias and recall bias could have influenced the findings. Conclusions: If the aim is for the horse to return to a competitive career post-treatment, the most appropriate surgical intervention appears to be the best approach, and an exercise rehabilitation plan may have benefit. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Orthopaedic diseases are the most common and problematic health issues for horses in training. A better understanding of the horse's bone structure and its changes related to everyday training may help to predict and avoid injury [1–3]. The objective of the present study was to estimate the influence of basic training effects on hock bone proportions in young horses enrolled in training for Polish Warmbloods officially conducted by Polish Horse Breeders Association. The hock bone proportions in young Polish Warmblood horses (n = 69) were studied based on x-ray image measurements done during official breeding horses performance testing. Six measurements were used to identify 4 width and length proportions indexes. The radiological examinations were done before and after horse training, which consists of work with or without the rider at walk, trot, and canter (40–50 min) with some light class (< 100 cm) jumping (< 12 jumps) 6 days a week. The training effect was investigated using analysis of variance (Mixed SAS). The statistical model included a random horse effect and fixed effects: training (1st, 2nd investigation), training centre (1st, 2nd), sex (19 stallion, 50 mares), limb (left, right), and regression on age in days. Pearson correlations between proportions were calculated. Training influenced two proportions. Tibial 3rd metatarsal epiphyses width proportion (AM; P < 0.0001) and hock multi-structural lengths proportion (DN; P = 0.0288) were greater after training. Distal epiphysis of the tibia (A) seems greater in training than the proximal epiphysis of the 3rd metatarsal epiphysis (M). The width proportions were revealed to be most affected by training, compared with the length proportions. Pearson correlations between measurements changed in training with the overall values from −0.2 to 0.2. Repeatability of measured indexes was mostly high (> 0.7). © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Angular limb deformities (ALDs) are a common skeletal development disorder in newborn foals. This condition affects the growth and development of foals and severely impacts their future athletic performance and economic value, causing significant financial losses to the horse industry. Placentitis, metritis, and severe metabolic diseases during mare pregnancy are significant causes of ALDs in newborn foals. It has been established that intestinal flora disorders can easily lead to inflammatory and metabolic diseases in the host. However, the incidence of ALDs in foals in Zhaosu County, Xinjiang, a key production area of China's horse industry, remains unclear. Additionally, the relationship between functional changes in foals with ALDs and their mares and changes in their intestinal flora is not well-understood. Methods: This study investigated the status of ALD in newborn foals through clinical observation and imaging examinations. In addition, molecular biological methods were applied to examine the effects of ALDs foals and their mares on physiological and biochemical markers and gut microbiota. Results: The results showed that the incidence of ALD in Zhaosu area of China was 4.13%. In addition, by comparing and correlating the physiological and biochemical indicators and intestinal flora of foals and mares with ALD with those of healthy horses, it was found that foals and mares with ALD may promote the occurrence and development of the disease through the “blood marker changes-intestinal flora-ALDs” axis. In addition, by comparing the physiological and biochemical indicators and intestinal flora of foals and mares with ALD with the intestinal flora of healthy horses, it was found that the physiological and biochemical indicators and intestinal flora structure and metabolic pathways of foals and mares with ALD had significant changes. Discussion: The diversity, species composition, and function of the intestinal flora of ALDs and their mares were significantly altered. These findings provide a scientific basis for understanding the etiology of ALDs in foals and offer new perspectives for diagnosing and treatment ALDs in newborn foals.

ABSTRACT: This work was designed to investigate the role of endurance exercise effects on some physical and biochemical parameters of peritoneal fluid of Iraqi Arabian horses. Ten local Iraqi Arabian horses were included, under a strict aseptic surgical approach, Peritoneal Fluid (PF) samples (5ml/each) were collected before and after running at different speeds, 48hrs interval between each type of speed. These samples were analyzed to determine the physical (pH, turbidity, viscosity, and color) and biochemical (total nucleated cells count(TNCC), total protein (TP), fibrinogen, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium, chloride, and potassium) parameters. The physical parameters showed gradual increases in pH, turbidity, and viscosity, and the color was changed to yellow in gallop. The biochemical parameters revealed significant increases in TNCC, TP, fibrinogen, creatinine, ALP, and lactate while there were gradual decreases in glucose, LDH, sodium, chloride, and potassium. A conclusion could be made that there are significant effects of endurance exercise on the physical and biochemical markers of the PF, and checking of sport horses must be done after hard sports. We consider these informational data are very useful for horsemen and veterinarians. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The purpose was to determine local (articular) and systemic effects of intra-articular interleukin-1 in horses supplemented with a dietary PUFA supplement [STRUCTURE-Joint (ST-J)]. Sixteen (16) healthy, mature, light breed horses were randomly assigned to diets containing 0 or 120 mL (n = 8 per group) of ST-J for 30 d. On days 0 (prior to beginning supplementation) and 27, recombinant equine interleukin-1β (reIL-1 β) (75 ng) was injected into the left or right intercarpal joint to induce mild, transient synovitis. Synovial fluid was obtained by aseptic arthrocentesis at postinjection hour 0 (immediately prior to IL-1 injection), 6, 12, and 72. ST-J supplementation for 30 d significantly increased synovial fluid nitric oxide, and resolvin D1 compared with the unsupplemented control group and significantly increased PGE2 levels and reduced joint circumference in the ST-J treated horses on day 30 compared to the same group of horses on day 0. There was also a significant increase in plasma hemoglobin, free and total bilirubin, and decrease in plasma glucose. These data provide evidence for the usefulness of ST-J to modulate physiological variables with importance in exercise performance and tissue adaptation to exercise stress and further research on this product is warranted. Lay Summary Although there is strong evidence in published literature supporting the positive effects of feeding a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplement to horses, many commercially available products lack scientific evidence for efficacy. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of a dietary PUFA supplement [STRUCTURE-Joint (ST-J)] on the response to inflammatory challenge. Sixteen healthy, mature horses received a diet containing ST-J (0 or 120 mL per day; 8 horses per group) for 30 d. An inflammatory challenge [recombinant interleukin-1β (IL-1)] was injected into the horses’ carpal joint to create a mild and temporary inflammation. Blood samples were collected on days 0 and 30, and joint fluid samples were collected at four time points after the injection of reIL-1 β to measure biomarkers of inflammation and joint health. Horses receiving ST-J had increased mediators of joint metabolism (prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide), which are important in exercise recovery and tissue adaptation. There also was an increase in hemoglobin and a decrease in glucose, supporting the use of this product to improve adaptation to exercise stress in horses. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Our study investigates the influence of genetic parameters related to inbreeding in the Hispano-Arabian horse, focusing on coat color patterns. A total of 11,010 horses born between 1900 and 2019 were analyzed. Fourteen coat colors were studied: Chestnut/Sorrel, Black, Bay, Dun, Grey, Isabelline, Overo, Palomino, Cremello, Pearl, Piebald, Roan, Smokey Cream, and White. These coats were categorized into two groups: pure coats (Chestnut/ Sorrel, Bay and Black) and diluted coats (Dun, Grey, Isabelline, Cremello, Overo, Palomino, Pearl, Piebald, Roan, Smokey Cream, and White). Using Bayesian analysis, we determined that inbreeding levels are higher in pure coat colors compared to diluted ones. The highest average inbreeding value was found in the bay coat (4.5%), while the lowest values were observed in white and piebald coats (0%). These findings highlight the need for careful management of breeding programs to preserve genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding in the Hispano-Arabian horse. © 2024, UCOPress.

ABSTRACT: As people become more emotionally involved with horses, they develop sophisticated communication skills, enabling horses to respond to human emotions [1]. An animal's reaction to stress can be influenced by the rider's or handler's emotional state, not just physical exertion, or environmental stimuli [2]. Cooperation and a strong emotional connection between the rider and the horse are crucial for good sporting results, reducing the risk of injuries, accidents, and stress for both [3]. To optimise the horse-human relationship, it is necessary to promote positive experiences through verbal or tactile communication, which strengthens the mutual emotional connection, decreases stress levels, and improves riding results. The purpose of this study was to analyse the interaction between the riding horses and the people riding them. To determine the mutual emotional connection between the horse and the human, the body language of the horse, the rider's touch to the horse and his voice were evaluated. Riding tests were conducted to determine the emotional connection between a horse and a person. The riding test consisted of two exercises: riding commands of 4 and a complete performance of 8-tuck. Both exercises were performed 4 times with an interval of 30 s. To determine the emotional level of the horse and the human, the heart rates of the horses and subjects were analysed per minute. A 5-question questionnaire for the subjects and a 3-question questionnaire for the parents of the subjects were used to determine the subjects’ emotional level before and after riding. The results of the study showed that the strength of the emotional connection between the horses in the stable and the people who ride them depends on the body language of the horses, the rider's touch to the horse and the result of his voice assessment scores. The execution time of the command also affected the efficiency of further executed commands. However, a study of heart rates between horses and humans showed that the heart rates of horses in a stable and the people who ride them are independent of each other. From the results of the survey of the subjects and the parents of the subjects, we can see that all children experience joy and happiness while riding and become more self-confident. Surveys also revealed to us that most subjects had fallen off their horses. Most developed a fear of falling again, while only a minority of subjects did not develop any psychological fear. © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Bothrops atrox is the most common viper in the Amazon, and its venom causes local and systemic changes. This report describes the clinicopathological and laboratory findings of ophidism due to Bothrops in six horses in Pará, Brazil. The animals, which belonged to five different rural properties, showed clinical signs of apathy, anorexia, and increased touch sensitivity in areas of increased volume. Three animals were bitten in the distal part of the pelvic limbs and three in the head area. The affected animals in the distal limb area exhibited marked edema extending from the fetlock to the thigh and had difficulty moving. Those affected in the head region exhibited an increase in volume that gave the appearance of a “rhinoceros head,” as well as blackening of the mucosa of the lips and gums. All animals exhibited tachycardia and tachypnea, and laboratory findings of two animals showed anemia, leukocytosis, increased clotting time, and elevated liver (AST and GGT) and kidney enzymes (urea and creatinine). Treatment was ineffective, and three of four treated animals died. Necropsy was performed on three animals, revealing extensive hemorrhage in the tissues at the snake bite sites and incoagulable bloody fluid in the cavities. Congestion was observed in the diaphragm, in the serosa of the small intestine, and in lighter areas on the renal surface. Histopathology showed muscle degeneration, necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, hemorrhage, and hyaline casts in the kidneys. This case report highlights the clinicopathological findings of snakebite in horses. In addition, this seems to be the first report of bothropic envenom in a mule in Brazil. © 2024 Colegio Brasileiro de Patologia Animal. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Dentigerous cysts are well-known congenital defects in horses, and the literature on this condition is extensive. Recently, a third type of dentigerous cyst, associated with an exostosis arising from the temporal bone, has been described. Today, computed tomography (CT) is often available and provides detailed information about the exact location and extent of dentigerous cysts, allowing for the description of new findings. Study design: This is a case series outlining the clinical, radiographic and computed tomographic features of dentigerous cysts in seven horses presented to the Equine Clinic at the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Switzerland. Objectives: The aim of this case series was to describe the radiographic and computed tomographic findings, and the occurrence of exostoses arising from the temporal bone, in horses with dentigerous cysts. Methods: The medical records of the Equine Hospital at the University of Zurich were reviewed for horses admitted with dentigerous cysts between 2007 and 2023. Data collected and analysed included patient signalment, clinical history, clinical signs and their duration prior to referral, diagnostic imaging results, treatment and outcomes. Results: The most common location for the cysts was the base of the ear, although in one case, the maxillary sinus was involved. Of the seven cases, four were Icelandic horses. CT proved superior to standard radiography for determining the extent and precise location of the cysts, as well as for identifying dental material and exostoses in the temporal region. CT also facilitated detailed surgical planning. All cysts were surgically removed with good long-term outcomes. Main limitations: Overall, the incidence of dentigerous cysts in horses was low. The relatively high occurrence of dentigerous cysts in Icelandic horses in this study is an interesting finding, though the small sample size calls for further research. Conclusions: Two of the cases in this series were similar to a recently described variant of a ‘temporal dentigerous cyst associated with an exostosis in the temporal region’ and were closely connected to the bony structure and draining tract. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chakouyi (CKY) horses from the Qinghai‒Xizang Plateau are well known for their unique lateral gaits and high-altitude adaptation, but genetic mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain unclear. This study presents a comparison of 60 newly resequenced genomes of gaited CKY horses with 139 public genomes from 19 horse breeds. Population structure analyses (admixture, PCA, and neighbor-joining tree) reveal a close genetic relationship between CKY and other highland breeds (Tibetan and Chaidamu horses). Compared with other Chinese breeds, CKY horses present reduced nucleotide diversity (θπ) and lower inbreeding (FROH coefficient), suggesting possible selective pressures. A key region on chromosome 23 (Chr23: 22.3 –22.6 Mb) is associated with the lateral gaits and harbors a highly prevalent nonsense mutation (Chr 23:22,391,254 C>A, Ser301STOP) in the DMRT3 gene, with an 88% homozygosity rate, which is strongly correlated with the distinctive gait of CKY horses. Furthermore, selection signals reveal that the EPAS1 gene is related to high-altitude adaptation, and the CAT gene contributes to altitude resilience in CKY horses. These findings suggest that preserving genetic diversity is essential for maintaining the unique gaits and high-altitude adaptations of CKY horses. © 2024 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of China

ABSTRACT: Criollo breed is quite popular in Brazil, mainly in the Southern Region, and the long loop rodeo is one of the main sports modality adapted to this breed. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in the muscle and oxidative functions caused by exercises practiced in this sports modality. Data such as exercising frequency, covered distance, mean duration time and number of runs, and blood samples at the following times: before the tournament, on the final day of the event, and 18–24 h after the end of the tournament were collected. Were assessed lactate and the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase (for the evaluation of the muscle function) and species reactive to oxygen, species reactive to thiobarbituric acid, catalase, superoxide dismutase and uric acid (for oxidative stress). Data were assessed through variance analysis associated with Tukey test (P ≤ 0.05), as well as through Spearman’s correlation (P ≤ 0.05). Significant creatine kinase and lactate increase in T1 associated with the maintenance of oxidative indicator levels in T1 and T18 reflected the significant muscle effort and the slight mobilization of oxidative parameters, which were compensated by the antioxidant defenses, since the assessed animals recovered after T18. There was no damage at cell level and the horses showed good muscle and antioxidant condition for exercising. © 2024 Society of Veterinary Medicine of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

ABSTRACT: The paper provides an overview of literature data and results of the authors’ own investigations on the phenomenon of a sudden mass appearance of a “large” (“giant”) form of the horse mackerel (Trachurus, Carangidae) (LM) in the Black Sea in the late 1940s and its unexpected disappearance in the mid-1960s. This phenomenon was of great interest and attracted attention of many researchers hypothesizing that it was a new source of information for understanding processes of the organisms’ adaptation and important issues of microevolution and speciation. Different approaches to the study of this fact are analyzed, including determination of the LM origin and clarification of its taxonomic status. On their basis, three mutually exclusive versions are proposed. According to the first one, the LM is a new species of the Mediterranean origin; according to the second one, it is an ecomorph of Trachurus mediterraneus ponticus; and according to the third one, it is a hybrid of T. mediterraneus mediterraneus and T. mediterraneus ponticus. Based on the investigation on thermal resistance of isolated muscles and serological analysis of tissue proteins, Yu. Altukhov and co-authors identified the LM as an independent species of the Mediterranean (and, possibly, Atlantic) origin which appeared in the Black Sea because of a sudden expansion of its range after a sharp increase (outburst) in abundance. The main evidence for the Black Sea origin of the LM is the fact as follows: all stages of its life cycle, i. e., reproduction, growth of juveniles, feeding, and wintering of adults, occur in the Black Sea; moreover, its large specimens were known earlier. Belonging of the Black Sea “small” horse mackerel and LM to the same species was confirmed by the electrophoretic studies on protein composition of their blood serum. The idea of the hybrid origin of the LM was first proposed by I. Dobrovolov based on an investigation of electrophoretic spectra of nonspecific muscle esterases in T. mediterraneus ponticus and T. mediterraneus mediterraneus. According to our data, the third version of the LM origin seems more probable than other ones. Occurrence of T. mediterraneus mediterraneus in the Black Sea and its hybridization with T. mediterraneus ponticus are manifestations of the mediterranization; this process has intensified due to increasing anthropogenic load on the ecosystem of Azov–Black Sea Basin and ongoing disruption of freshwater balance resulting from overregulation of river flows and sea salinization. None of three versions can be refuted or confirmed by molecular genetic methods, since there is currently no LM in the Black Sea. Thus, the phenomenon of the “large” horse mackerel appearance in the Black Sea is still unexplained. © 2024 A.O. Kovalevsky Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas of RAS. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Owners sometimes raise issues relating to management and problem behavior with their veterinarian, but many veterinarians feel ill-prepared to deal with these. This is not helped by some of the terminology that is used, which may not only be unfamiliar to those without a background in behavior, but is also used in different ways by different authors. In this chapter, we review our scientific understanding of many behavior problems, with a special emphasis on repetitive behavior problems (commonly referred to as “vices” or stereotypies) and lay out an approach to problem behavior with which the average equine veterinarian should be able to engage. Veterinarians have a specific responsibility to understand health issues that might impact behavior, and so we outline how this should be evaluated. In the final section, we describe practical suggestions for a range of problem behaviors which affect the welfare and needs of horses. © 2025 Elsevier Inc. All rights are reserved.

ABSTRACT: Anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS) are banned substances in both human and equine sports. They are often administered intramuscularly to horses in esterified forms for the purpose of extending their duration of action. As such, the detection of intact esters of endogenous steroids in hair is particularly advantageous, as it can provide unequivocal proof of their external origin. Compared with urine and blood matrices, hair in general allows a longer detection window as long as the administered drug can be incorporated into hair and has not degraded. This can be useful in doping control of equine sports, where the timing of sample collection may be critical due to the transient nature of AAS in other biological fluids. This paper describes the detection of AAS and/or their esters, as well as corticosteroids, in horse hair using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) and gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) after solid-supported liquid extraction (SLE) at basic pH. The developed UPLC-HRMS and GC-MS/MS methods in combination allowed the detection of 117 AAS, corticosteroids and/or their esters with estimated limits of detection down to sub-ppb levels and with good inter-day precision. Method applicability has been demonstrated through the detections of (i) boldenone undecylenate, nandrolone phenylpropionate and trenbolone acetate in three proficiency testing hair samples and (ii) nandrolone as a metabolite in a post-administration hair sample collected from a castrated horse having been administered nandrolone decanoate. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 2-year-old male Thoroughbred presented with the right hindlimb lameness for the past 3 months. The horse showed swelling around the right stifle. Radiography revealed radiolucency in the medial condyle of the right femur, indicative of subchondral cystic lesion. The horse underwent surgery under general anesthesia. Acortical screw was located on serial radiographs. After placing the screw in the medial condyle, arthroscopy was performed to identify lesions in the femorotibial joint; however, no significant findings were observed. The horse recovered smoothly from anesthesia with assistance and was discharged 1 day later. The owner reported the horse did not show lameness; it returned to training and started racing. This report describes transcondylar screw fixation in a horse with a subchondral bone cyst in South Korea, and suggests that bone screw fixation is an effective treatment for subchondral cystic lesions of the femoral condyle. © The Korean Society of Veterinary Clinics.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The shift of the horse breeding sector from agricultural to leisure and sports purposes led to a decrease in local breeds’ population size due to the loss of their original breeding purposes. Most of the Italian breeds must adapt to modern market demands, and gait traits are suitable phenotypes to help this process. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology can be used to objectively assess them. This work aims to investigate on IMU recorded data (i) the influence of environmental factors and biometric measurements, (ii) their repeatability, (iii) the correlation with judge evaluations, and (iv) their predictive value. Material and methods: The Equisense Motion S® was used to collect phenotypes on 135 horses, Bardigiano (101) and Murgese (34) and the data analysis was conducted using R (v.4.1.2). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to assess the effects of biometric measurements and environmental and animal factors on the traits. Results and discussion: Variations in several traits depending on the breed were identified, highlighting different abilities among Bardigiano and Murgese horses. Repeatability of horse performance was assessed on a subset of horses, with regularity and elevation at walk being the traits with the highest repeatability (0.63 and 0.72). The positive correlation between judge evaluations and sensor data indicates judges’ ability to evaluate overall gait quality. Three different algorithms were employed to predict the judges score from the IMU measurements: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). A high variability was observed in the accuracy of the SVM model, ranging from 55 to 100% while the other two models showed higher consistency, with accuracy ranging from 74 to 100% for the GBM and from 64 to 88% for the KNN. Overall, the GBM model exhibits the highest accuracy and the lowest error. In conclusion, integrating IMU technology into horse performance evaluation offers valuable insights, with implications for breeding and training.

ABSTRACT: The connection between horse osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) and performance is controversial [1, 2], so detailed study of bone structure seems essential. The study aims to compare the measured hock bone structure proportion indexes with performance and OCD status. The data consists of hock structure proportion indexes (x-ray image measurements), conformation evaluation (3 objective measurements, 4 subjective traits), performance results (6 subjective traits), and OCD evaluation conducted during official performance tests for young Polish Warmblood breeding horses organised by Polish Horse Breeders Association. The four proportion indexes (157–164 observations) were based on bone structure measurements of hock x-ray images of 69 horses (50 mares; 19 stallions), tested twice (before and after) during a basic training test (60–100 days) for young breeding horses (age 1249 days ± 114.6). The analysis of correlations (SAS programme) showed that conformation traits were connected on the medium level (−0.4–0.6; P < 0.05) with hock structure proportions indexes. The performance traits correlated with proportion indexes mainly for the overall trait – “usability” and walk evaluation (0.3–0.4; P < 0.05). The health OCD status was not connected with any of the measured proportion indexes. The obtained correlations were not the same in both training stages. Results seem informative for the evaluation of hock images and horse performance prediction. © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, reported cases of salmonellosis in cattle and horses in Hokkaido, Japan, have increased. To optimize antimicrobial therapy, we assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella isolates from these animals. Among 112 bovine isolates, high resistance rates were observed for streptomycin (92.0%), ampicillin (88.4%), and tetracycline (79.5%), while resistance rates for kanamycin (8.9%), ciprofloxacin (1.8%), gentamicin (0.0%), and colistin (0.0%) were low. Additionally, 18.8% of the bovine isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, and all of these cefotaxime-resistant isolates carried blaCMY-2. Among 16 equine isolates, no resistance was observed to cefazolin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, colistin, or chloramphenicol. Gentamicin and kanamycin are recommended as the first-line treatment for salmonellosis in cattle, with fluoroquinolones as the second choice. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Hyaluronic acid (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in joint synovial fluid, is administered to horses as an anti-inflammatory with lubrication properties. This experiment examined the effects of HA administered before and shortly after an exercise test on metacarpophalangeal (MCP; fetlock) and tibiotarsal (hock) joint range of motion (ROM). Horses were injected intravenously (IV) with placebo (4 mL, saline) or HA (4 mL, 40 mg) 24 h before performing a standardized exercise test (SET) on a high-speed treadmill and again at 6-h post-SET. Passive fetlock flexion was measured at 4 and 24 h post-SET. Hock flexion and extension were measured at 24 h post-SET by videography and kinematic evaluation at the trot. Parameters of the SET were sufficient to cause peak lactate values of 6.6 ± 0.15 mM and a maximum heart rate of 203.6 ± 4.8 bpm. A minor gain (P = 0.08) in fetlock flexion prior to SET was observed in HA horses that were not retained at either 4 or 24 h post-SET. Hock flexion in both limbs was greater (P < 0.05) at 24 h post-SET, independent of treatment. Horses receiving HA exhibited reduced (P = 0.04) right hock extension. No differences in either right or left hock ROM were observed between control and HA-treated horses. From these results, it is concluded that IV HA injections surrounding an exercise stressor offer no substantive gains in either fetlock or hock ROM. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This report describes the application of a resorbable implant (Resorb-Vet) made of poly-(DL) lactide (PDLLA) for the repair of a maxillary fracture in one horse and a nasal bone fracture in another. The horses were positioned in lateral recumbency and the fracture was reduced. An absorbable plate was moulded to the bone and fixed with PDLLA pins, which were attached to an ultrasonic device and inserted into predrilled holes by ultrasonic vibrations. Once the pins contacted the bone, the ultrasonic vibrations caused liquefication of the PDLLA, which infiltrated the bone and solidified after the ultrasonic vibrations ceased. Immediate primary stability was achieved with this technique. Both horses recovered well, were discharged without complications and returned to their previous level of activity. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to measure the whole blood viscosity (WBV) in racehorses using a new viscometer and establish reference values, as well as to investigate the correlation between the WBV and the haematological parameters and serum chemistry. WBV measurements were conducted on 51 Thoroughbred horses using a novel U-shaped scanning capillary-tube viscometer. The reference values for the WBV were determined at various shear rates ranging from 1 s-1 to 1 000 s-1. Correlation analyses were performed to examine the correlation between the WBV and the haematological and serum chemistry parameters. The findings provide valuable reference data for the WBV in Thoroughbred horses and enhance understanding of the relationship between the WBV and routine blood tests in equine health assessment. © 2024 The authors.

ABSTRACT: An 18-year-old Saxon Warmblood gelding was referred to an equine clinic in the Czech Republic in May 2019 for mild colic. The horse had 7 h of grazing and 30–45 min of exercise every day. At the clinic, physical examination ruled out gastrointestinal disease, while clinical pathology confirmed rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase 29,088 IU/L; reference range 110–250 IU/L). Because of the suspicion of atypical myopathy (AM), metabolomic analysis of hypoglycin A (HGA), 31 acylcarnitines (ACs) and free carnitine was performed in four dry serum and one blood spot. After laboratory confirmation of AM in the patient studied (HGA: 0.757–0.415 μmol/L, ACs elevation), an incriminated pasture was visited and searched for the source of the toxin. No sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) was found in the vicinity of the pasture. However, several box elder (Acer negundo) trees were found, and toxicological analysis revealed HGA in the samaras (7.66–296.00 mg/kg), leaves (2.12–9.39 mg/kg) and seedlings (339.00 mg/kg). Not only sycamore but also the box elder tree can be a potential source of poisoning in horses in Europe, particularly in lowland areas with a warm climate. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The study aimed to develop and evaluate an antibody quality improvement method to improve the accuracy and efficiency of chlamydia diagnosis in horses. The study was conducted in Kazakhstan and included 100 horses of the Kazakh breed infected with chlamydia, which was divided into two groups: experimental and control. In the experimental group, affinity chromatography was used to purify immunoglobulin G (IgG), which allowed for a 95% purity of the antibodies. The control group used a traditional diagnostic method without preliminary purification, which ensured IgG purity of only 60-65%. The data showed that the purified antibodies demonstrated improved diagnostic performance, including an increase in sensitivity of up to 92% and specificity of up to 95%. The purified antibodies provided effective binding to chlamydial antigens even at low concentrations (0.2cμg/ml), which is 2.5 times better than in the control group. The time to obtain a stable diagnostic signal was reduced by 33% and amounted to 20 minutes in the experimental group versus 30 minutes in the control group. The frequency of false-positive results in the experimental group was reduced to 5% and false-negative results to 4%, which significantly increases the overall reliability of diagnostics. The purified antibodies retained their activity for 12 months, demonstrating high stability and durability. These results highlighted the importance of using chromatographic purification to improve the quality of antibodies used for diagnostic purposes and offer a reliable approach for the accurate detection of chlamydia as well as other infectious diseases in animals. The introduction of such methods can significantly improve the efficiency of veterinary diagnostics and contribute to more timely and adequate treatment of animals © The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We investigated the changes in inbreeding levels in Japanese Thoroughbred horses over the past 46 years. Our results show a significant increase in inbreeding over the past 30 years, primarily due to the influence of two sires, Northern Dancer and Sunday Silence. Northern Dancer’s bloodline spread gradually through descendants like Northern Taste, leading to a slower increase in the inbreeding coefficient. In contrast, Sunday Silence was directly imported and became a leading sire, causing a rapid increase in his blood proportion and inbreeding coefficient. Our findings suggest that monitoring the trajectories of successful sires and considering historical factors can help predict and control potential inbreeding depression in the future. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To compare end-to-side (ES) and side-to-side (SS) jejunocecostomy (JC) in healthy horses. Study design: Experimental study in vivo. Animals: A total of 14 healthy adult horses underwent ventral midline celiotomy, a resection, and either an ES (n = 7) or stapled SS (n = 7) JC. Methods: Surgical times and the external lengths of completed anastomoses were measured. Physical examinations and pain scoring were performed every 6 h for 5 days, then once daily until euthanasia and necropsy 28 days postoperatively. Results: The anastomosis was completed more rapidly (p <.002) with the SS JC (mean 44.21 ± 4.91 min) than the ES JC (mean 54.24 ± 4.59 min). One horse in the ES group developed colic from an ischemic anastomosis and was euthanized. Three horses (1 ES JC and 2 SS JC) exhibited mild colic postoperatively, and the remaining horses had no complications. Postoperative heart rates and pain scores were similar between groups (p <.16 and p <.67, respectively). The internal length of the anastomosis was significantly larger (p <.001) in the SS JC (mean 9.27 ± 1.05 cm) than the ES JC (mean 6.31 ± 1.4 cm) at necropsy. Conclusion: Both methods for JC were well tolerated and functional in both groups using the selected protocols for anesthesia, surgery and aftercare. Clinical significance: This study provides evidence that both stapled SS JC and handsewn ES JC are acceptable for use in clinical cases, although additional procedures are required to maximize lumen size with the ES JC. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess the effect of two different doses of intramuscular atipamezole on head height (HH) in horses after sedation with detomidine. Study design: Randomized, blinded, triple crossover study. Animals: Eight healthy adult horses. Methods: Baseline HH was measured before detomidine (40 μg kg–1) was injected intravenously. HH was measured at 10 and 20 minutes after injection. Then, saline, atipamezole 60 μg kg–1 (AT60) or 120 μg kg–1 (AT120) was injected intramuscularly. HH measurements were repeated at 10 minutes intervals for 100 minutes. HH data were analyzed with a linear mixed model. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Results: Baseline HH (cm) was 118 ± 14 for saline, 120 ± 10 for AT60, and 115 ± 14 for AT120 and was not significantly different among groups (p > 0.05). AT60 HH was greater than saline at 80 (33 ± 11 versus 28 ± 11), 90 (45 ± 15 versus 26 ± 13), and 110 (57 ± 24 versus 32 ± 11) minutes (all p < 0.002). AT120 HH was greater than saline at 50 (33 ± 16 versus 22 ± 8), 80 (44 ± 11 versus 28 ± 11), 90 (45 ± 11 versus 26 ± 13), 100 (52 ± 18 versus 30 ± 16) and 110 (64 ± 23 versus 32 ± 11) minutes (all p < 0.002). HH was not significantly different at any time between AT60 and AT120 (all p > 0.05). Conclusions and clinical relevance: Horses administered atipamezole showed signs of reversal of sedation, as evaluated by HH compared with saline. Horses administered the higher dose of atipamezole had HH greater than saline sooner than horses administered the lower dose. Intramuscular atipamezole may be useful for reversal of detomidine sedation in horses. © 2024 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: The enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH), was investigated via a hybrid computational approach, for molecular reactions involved in chiral synthesis of S-alcohols, when the natural co-factor, 1,4-dihyronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 1,4-NADH, was replaced with biomimetic co-factor, N-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, 1. We surmised that different hydride and proton transfer mechanisms were involved using co-factor, 1. An alternative mechanism, where the hydride transfer step occurred, via an η1-keto-S-η2-5,6-1,4-dihydronicotinamide-Zn(II) complex, was previously investigated with a model of the HLADH−Zn(II) catalytic site (J. Organometal. Chem. 2021, 943, 121810). Presently, we studied canonical and alternative mechanisms compared to models of the entire enzyme structure. We disproved the η2-Zn(II) complex, and discovered a canonical hydride transfer from biomimetic 1,4-NADH, 1, to the Zn(II) bound prochiral ketone substrate, followed by a new proton relay, consisting of a water chain connecting His51 to Ser48 that accomplished the S-alkoxy anion's protonation to yield the final S-alcohol product. The HLADH catalysis, with biomimetic co-factor, 1, that replaced the ribose group, the 5′-diphosphate groups, and the adenine nucleotide with a N-benzyl group, has provided a new paradigm for the design of other structures of 1,4-NADH biomimetic co-factors, including their economic value in biocatalysis reactions. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study fits within calls for research on the experiences of children who care deeply about animals and whose intensity of empathy could typify them as supernurturers. This study had a two-part purpose. First, the analysis explores whether and how young supernurturers perceive horses as agentic beings who direct empathy toward them. Second, the study addresses whether perceived horse empathy gives supernurturers permission to value self-empathy. The sample included 34 girls and young women aged 10 through 23 years from 30 families who were part of a hunter/jumper riding community. Open-ended interviews of about 1–2 hours in length were conducted. The analysis showed that these young supernurturers perceive horses as volitional actors who engage in empathy. Additionally, it suggested that encounters with perceived horse empathy are associated with (a) heightened capacity to engage in self-empathy when distressed, (b) expanded appreciation for how their own nurturing skills refined through horse caretaking transfer to other contexts, and (c) willingness to allow their satisfaction in loving and learning about horses to spill over to other life domains. In short, this study found evidence that perceived horse empathy provides opportunities for supernurturers to experience their own humanity through the regard of an animal other. © 2024 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

ABSTRACT: Background: Basophils are the rarest blood leukocyte in most healthy domestic mammals and the clinical significance of basophilia is poorly understood. Objectives: To empirically determine magnitude thresholds for basophilia, identify its hematologic correlates, and identify associations between breeds, specific diseases, disease categories, organ systems, and basophilia in dogs, cats, and horses. Methods: CBCs and clinical information from dogs, cats, and horses were collected from the University of California-Davis School of Veterinary Medicine between 2000 and 2020. Relationships between basophil concentration and other CBC parameters were evaluated by computing Pearson's correlation (r). Magnitude thresholds for basophilia (ie, mild, moderate, severe) were determined by evaluating the distribution of basophil counts for each species. For severe cases of basophilia, the clinical diagnoses were categorized by the organ system affected and the underlying pathomechanism. Basophilia groups were compared to a time-matched, randomly selected control group, and chi-square analyses were performed to evaluate associations with disease. Results: A total of 143 841 (dog), 32 576 (cat), and 44 887 (horse) CBCs were collected. For all three species, basophilia was over-represented in some breeds. Basophilia was associated with respiratory disease in both dogs and cats. In dogs, lymphoma and mast cell neoplasia were associated with basophilia. In horses, an increased incidence of basophilia was not associated with any disease category or organ system. Conclusions: This is the largest study evaluating the hematologic correlations and disease associations with basophilia in dogs, cats, and horses. While basophilia was reported alongside many diseases, certain associations may aid clinicians in narrowing down underlying causes. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Little information describing the biologic behaviour and therapies for corneal lymphoma exist. Objectives: To characterise histologically confirmed equine corneal lymphoma considering breed, age or sex predisposition, histologic and immunologic features, therapies and outcomes. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: A multicentre retrospective medical record review was used to identify horses that presented with corneal disease confirmed morphologically as corneal lymphoma from 2012 to 2022. Results: Mean age at diagnosis was 10.5 years. Males represented 18/26 cases. Warmblood (14) and Thoroughbred (6) breeds were most commonly represented. 25/26 had unilateral ocular involvement. No cases had evidence of multicentric lymphoma. Most eyes (77.7%) had a history of suspected immune-mediated keratitis (IMMK) or eosinophilic keratitis. Morphological diagnosis confirming lymphoma was available for all cases. B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed in 19/24 eyes for which immunohistochemistry was performed, with intermediate to large B-cell lymphoma being most common. Fifteen of 27 eyes received at least one form of adjunctive therapy following keratectomy. Four eyes, which did not receive adjunctive therapy following keratectomy, experienced recurrence. No horses treated with adjunctive therapy following keratectomy experienced recurrence. Malignant transformation of IMMK to lymphoma was morphologically documented in one eye and suspected in three others based on recurrence of clinical signs. All globes were retained and visualised at the last follow-up. Main limitations: Incomplete medical records, owner subjectivity concerning onset of disease and cases being lost to follow-up. Conclusions: Malignant transformation of IMMK to corneal lymphoma likely occurs in horses. Lymphoma should be a differential for nonulcerative keratitis in horses. Keratectomy and histopathology may be considered in progressive or refractory cases of IMMK to rule out neoplastic disease. Recurrence of corneal lymphoma is unlikely following excision and adjunctive therapy. Cases with large corneal surface area or deep stromal involvement may have a likelihood for recurrence. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Warmblood horses are a popular breed around the world for equestrian sports. Previous studies have investigated ocular findings in other breeds of horses; however, no studies exist for the Warmblood breed. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of ocular abnormalities in a convenience sample of Warmblood horses in South Africa and to determine if the prevalence of lens and chorioretinal lesions increase with age. Study design: Descriptive, observational study. Methods: Warmblood horses underwent a full ophthalmic examination which included a Schirmer tear test (STT), tonometry, fluorescein dye testing, slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Age was categorised into three groups namely <8 years old, 8–13 years old and 14+ years old for statistical analysis. Prevalence of lens and chorioretinal lesions were compared between age categories. Results: One hundred and four horses (208 eyes) were examined. The age range was 5 months to 30 years (mean 11 years, standard deviation [SD] 6 years). Ocular pathology was noted in 125 eyes (60.1%) and 79 horses (76%). The highest number of lesions were noted in the choroid and retina, iris and lens. Chorioretinal lesions were seen in 100 eyes (48.1%) and in 65 horses (62.5%). Iridial lesions were seen in 19 eyes (9.1%) and 12 horses (11.5%). Cataracts were seen in 19 eyes (9.1%) and in 13 horses (12.5%). The presence of total chorioretinal lesions (eye level [p = 0.002]; horse level [p = 0.004]), focal chorioretinal lesions (eye level [p = 0.004]; horse level [p = 0.008]) and cataract (eye [p = 0.03]; horse level [p = 0.02]) were all shown to statistically increase with age. Main limitations: A small sample size and limited geographic area. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of ocular pathology in this population of Warmblood horses in South Africa. This reiterates the importance of an ocular examination as a part of routine health checks, as well as during prepurchase examinations. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic cannabinoid obtained from hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) used for pain management in companion animals including horses. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabigerol/cannabidiol oil (CBG/CBD) oral administration in alleviating pain in adult horses affected by chronic osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty-four horses (10 geldings and 14 mares), aged between 11 and 18 years old, were equally divided into two groups. One group received CBDA 15% oil and the other group received CBG/CBD oil (CBG20%-CBD10%) for 14 consecutive days. A standard dose of 0.07 mg/kg was chosen based on the mean body weight of 450 ± 28 kg. Horse Chronic Pain Scale (HCPS) and physiological parameters monitoring heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), arterial blood pressure (systolic arterial pressure- SAP, diastolic arterial pressure- DAP) were assessed before (T0) and every day for the entire administration (T1-T14). Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of complete hemogram, Leukocyte subpopulation identification and counting and leukocyte differentiation antigens CD4 and CD8 at the day before the administration (T0) and every 7 days (T7 and T14). A reduction of HCPS pain scale scores and the number of WBC, monocytes and neutrophils and CD8 was observed with both CBDA and CBG/CBD treatment. No statistical differences were found in the physiological parameters. No subject required rescue analgesia or showed any adverse effects. The results of this study showed that oral administration of both CBDA and CBG/CBD oil may promote pain reduction in adult horses affected by chronic OA.

ABSTRACT: Background: In Great Britain, owners are keeping their horses into increasingly older age, reflecting societal changes in human–animal relationships. The uptake of routine veterinary services is reported to reduce as horses age. Horse owners seek information regarding their animal's health from alternative sources before and/or following veterinary involvement. Information regarding the experiences and behaviours of veterinarians toward older horse health care provision is limited. Objective: This study sought to explore how veterinary care for the ageing horse is conceptualised and approached by veterinarians treating horses in Great Britain. Study design: Exploratory qualitative. Methods: A subset of qualitative data, collected as part of a larger study investigating how owners and veterinarians make decisions regarding the care of the older horses, was analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach. Data included semi-structured in-depth interviews with nine veterinarians and veterinary clinical records pertaining to the horses of 13 participating owners. Results: Veterinarians valued regular interactions with owners to optimise a horse's management, however, the timing and nature of veterinary involvement varied. The context of older age shaped decision-making and ‘age-appropriate’ interventions were negotiated within the context of each horse and owner. Where participants had concerns about a horse, they sought to achieve an owner's adherence to their advice while navigating the veterinarian–owner relationship. Interpersonal dimensions of veterinarian–owner interactions appeared to shape, and could challenge, veterinarians' delivery of health care services and their own sense of being a professional who cares for animals, and about people. Main limitations: A sample of veterinarians were recruited for this study based on horse owners' involvement. Conclusions: The provision of veterinary care for the older horse rests upon networks of relationships. Collaboration between the profession and owners in both the design and delivery of, veterinary health care services may better enable different types of knowledge and values to be brought together more effectively. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: In anaesthetised horses, bradycardia secondary to high vagal tone can reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. The use of anticholinergics in horses is limited due to concerns about ileus and abdominal discomfort. This retrospective study sought to determine the prevalence of post-operative abdominal discomfort in healthy horses that received atropine under isoflurane anaesthesia. Study design: A retrospective evaluation of 222 general anaesthesia events between January 2019 and December 2019 was undertaken. Methods: One hundred and eleven horses that received atropine were identified, and 111 case match controls that did not receive atropine were also selected. Information gathered from the medical records included signalment, anaesthetic drugs, surgical procedures, duration of anaesthesia and surgery, dobutamine and atropine administration, and the occurrence of abdominal discomfort for 24 h after anaesthesia. After initial data analysis, a second cohort of records was assessed separately. The horses in this group were castrated under general anaesthesia (with or without atropine; n = 68). Logistic regression models and Fisher's exact tests were used to look for factors contributing to abdominal discomfort post-anaesthesia. The significance level was set to 5% (p < 0.05). Results: Atropine administration was not associated with the development of post-anaesthetic abdominal discomfort (OR = 2.121, 95% CI [0.767, 5.869]; p = 0.2). Overall, 18/222 (8.1%) incidences of abdominal discomfort were identified. All incidents occurred in colts undergoing castration. In a separate analysis of only horses anaesthetised for castration, atropine was associated with developing abdominal discomfort (OR = 3.143, 95% CI [1.082, 9.132]; p = 0.04). Discussion: Atropine was not associated with post-operative abdominal discomfort except in colts undergoing castration. All episodes of discomfort were mild and resolved with minimal intervention. The potential impact of insufficient analgesia in horses undergoing castration is a confounding factor and requires prospective investigation. Conclusion: Overall, atropine at a dose of 0.006 mg/kg IV appears to be a safe method to treat bradycardia in otherwise healthy horses anaesthetised for orthopaedic and upper airway procedures. Further work is required to determine if atropine is safe for colts undergoing castration. © 2024 The Author(s). Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: While previous reports come mostly from the southern Americas, several outbreaks of hypersalivation in horses were observed in Middle Europe from 2016 to 2018. Objective: To describe feed-induced hypersalivation in European horses. Study design: Analysis of feedstuffs. Methods: Veterinarians and horse or stable owners were encouraged to submit feedstuffs from case outbreaks of hypersalivation in which, infectious diseases or other systemic causes of the syndrome were ruled out and intoxication was suspected. Feedstuff analysis was performed, including gross examination, microscopic analysis of fine particles, and for hay and forage mycological culturing and mycotoxin testing. Results: Eleven case outbreaks were investigated. Typical clinical findings in the horses were either foamy saliva around the mouth or serous salivation with puddles forming on the ground. Some horses also showed lesions of the gingival mucosa and/or the tongue. Foamy hypersalivation, sometimes combined with lesions of tongue and/or gingiva, was associated with finding of ergot sclerotia and ergot alkaloids in hay or pasture plants (ergocornin and ergocorninin having the highest concentrations). Serous hypersalivation with massive loss of fluid was associated with the fungus Rhizoctonia spp. As indicated by the detection of traces of swainsonine, mycotoxin production on the forage was seen as likely cause. The cessation of clinical signs took days to weeks after diet change, probably depending on the duration, type and amount of toxin intake. Main limitations: Small number of case outbreaks, records of clinical findings and horses' management were incomplete and were reported by horse owners. Conclusion: Hypersalivation due to mycotoxins in the feed has become an emerging problem for horses in middle Europe. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Societal concerns for animal welfare extend to all domestic species, including high-level sport horses. The welfare of these horses, notably highlighted during the recent Olympics, has garnered significant public interest, prompting inquiries into their living conditions. Animal welfare studies have emphasised three key needs crucial to equine welfare: unlimited access to forage, freedom of movement, and social interactions with peers, commonly referred to as the “3Fs”—access to Forage, Freedom of movement, and interactions with Friend conspecifics. However, the feasibility and benefits of satisfying these needs specifically for sport horses remain unexplored. Indeed, they may face unique challenges such as high physical workload, extensive travel, limited time in their home stables, weight management, and high economic value necessitating careful handling. Consequently, restrictions on feeding, freedom of movement, and social contact are often deemed necessary. This field study aims to assess the actual level of implementation of welfare in high-level sport horses by evaluating body condition, injury risk, and behavioural welfare indicators in their home stable. To achieve this objective, the welfare of 56 high-level sport horses competing internationally was assessed using behavioural indicators of welfare through scan sampling (abnormal behaviours, i.e., stereotypies, aggression towards humans, withdrawn behaviour, and alert behaviours; positions of the ears in a backward position while foraging, watching behaviours, and through other Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) protocol measures). This study shows that there exists a large variability among horses regarding their access to the 3Fs, with some of them having a lot of restrictions and others not, meaning it is possible to respect them while competing at a high level. Second, we observed that the fewer restrictions the horses experience regarding the 3Fs while in their home stables, the better their welfare, as demonstrated by the indicators we assessed. These results undeniably support the fact that unrestricted access to forage, the ability to move freely outdoors, and the opportunity to interact socially with conspecifics are fundamental needs of horses that could be provided to horses, also to high-performance ones. It is therefore essential that solutions are put in place to ensure that these conditions are met. Copyright © 2024 Phelipon, Hennes, Ruet, Bret-Morel, Górecka-Bruzda and Lansade.

ABSTRACT: The most common disorder affecting the salivary glands in horses is trauma to the parotid gland or duct. Several management techniques have been described, each with their own set of complications. The objective of this case report was to describe the direct injection of botulinum toxin type A into the parotid gland and its outcome in two clinical cases involving damage to either the parotid salivary gland or its duct. Both cases involved iatrogenic damage to either the parotid salivary gland or its duct. Treatment for both cases involved the injection of 200 units of botulinum toxin type A into the parotid gland in order to reduce salivary production and to prevent the potential development of a chronic fistula. Follow-up assessment after the treatment was conducted via telephone consultation and photographs from the owners. In both clinical cases, a marked reduction in saliva production from the parotid gland was noted within 2 days after toxin injection and the wounds healed without complication. In the first case, the treatment was repeated after 3 weeks. No short- or long-term side effects after injection were reported by the owners. Limitations were the small number of cases and the lack of literature regarding the dose and treatment regime for botulinum toxin type A in horses. It was concluded that the administration of botulinum toxin type A appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative or complementary procedure for the treatment and prevention of parotid gland or duct fistulas in horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) serves as a crucial cardiac biomarker in human and small animal veterinary medicine, yet its role in equine cardiology remains underexplored. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the influence of different exercise types on BNP concentrations and single brief echocardiographic parameters in two distinct horse populations, while also examining potential correlations between BNP concentrations and echocardiographic variables. Study design: Forty clinically healthy horses, categorised into working and sports groups, underwent exercise testing exercise to their purposes. BNP concentrations were measured using a horse-specific ELISA kit, and brief echocardiographic examinations were conducted 24 h post-exercise. Methods: Blood samples were collected before, after exercises, and at rest to determine plasma BNP concentrations. The brief echocardiographic examinations looked only at M-mode imaging from the right parasternal window, and assessed cardiac chambers and ventricular diameters. BNP concentrations and echocardiographic variables were compared between the two groups. Results: Exercise did not significantly increase BNP concentrations in either group, with sports horses exhibiting higher basal BNP values (18.0–1973.0 pg/mL) compared to work horses (14.4–1074.5 pg/mL). No significant differences in BNP concentrations were observed between breeds, sexes, or pregnancy statuses. Brief echocardiographic examinations using M-mode imaging from the right parasternal window revealed significant differences in right ventricular dimensions in diastole and relative wall thickness between the groups. A low negative correlation (r = −0.329, p = 0.038) was observed between BNP concentration and fractional shortening. Main limitations: Single pre-exercise blood sampling, brief M-mode echocardiography, and lack of exercise standardisation in the endurance horse group limited assessing high biological variability on BNP concentration and echocardiographic parameters in the tested horses. Conclusions: Assessing BNP concentrations and echocardiographic parameters during different exercises can be helpful in examining the functional status of the equine cardiovascular system, guiding tailored exercise regimens for optimal equine well-being. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Conceiving animal heterotopias as spaces where normalised conceptions and uses of animals are resisted, subverted and, where necessary, undone, this chapter draws on visits and interviews undertaken at seven such spaces in the UK. Participants include three sanctuaries, two UK non-ridden equine association members, and two chicken rescuers who use hormone implants to arrest their ex-battery hens’ production cycle. Interviews explore everyday arrangements of care and intimacy, the nature of inter-and intra-species bonds, and the role of humans in the ‘community.' Exploring Foucault’s notion of ‘lines of fragility,' the chapter also examines contact zones between these spaces and broader norms in terms of the permeability of boundaries, types of resistance encountered, and what these say about the possibilities and also limitations of different heterotopias. This raises questions about the extent to which ‘liberation’ is understood from an animal or human point of view, and highlights the continuing need for multiple, but also more coordinated, approaches to creating post-anthropocentric futures. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Paula Arcari; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In the diagnostics of orthopedic diseases in the horse, diagnostic imaging often plays a decisive role. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging is used in both human and small animal medicine and becoming increasingly popular. To see whether CBCT imaging can be useful in the diagnosis of orthopedic diseases of the carpal region of the horse and to explore possible limitations we compared CBCT images with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images of the carpal region of equine cadaveric specimens. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight forelimbs from fifteen horses, slaughtered for reasons unrelated to this study, were examined. Native and contrast enhanced CBCT and MDCT scans were performed. Anatomical structures were blindly evaluated by three independent experienced observers using a visual scoring system previously reported and adapted to the equine carpal region. A descriptive evaluation was carried out as well as Spearman’s rank correlation and interobserver agreement was shown by percent agreement (PA). Results: Visualization of osseous structures was excellent in both MDCT and CBCT. Articular cartilage could only be assessed in contrast enhanced scans whereby MDCT showed a slightly better visualization than CBCT. Soft tissue structures were generally difficult to assess. An exception were the medial and lateral palmar intercarpal ligament, which could not be visualized in native but were well visualized in contrast enhanced scans in both MDCT and CBCT images. Discussion/conclusion: For the evaluation of osseous structures and some intraarticular ligaments after contrast enhancement, CBCT serves as a reliable diagnostic imaging modality for the equine carpal region. However, soft tissue structures and cartilage are imaged more reliably using MDCT. Copyright © 2024 Hagenbach, Bierau, Cruz, Koch, Manso-Díaz, Büttner, Staszyk and Röcken.

ABSTRACT: Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a zoonotic obligate intracellular pathogen, that infects horses and is transmitted by Ixodes ticks. The seropositivity for this pathogen does not necessarily associate with clinical signs. Limited data about the epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum in horses in Egypt are available. The purpose of the study was to determine the seroprevalence of A. phagocytophilum in Egyptian horses in three Egyptian governorates and to assess the associated risk factors for infection. A total of 395 serum samples from suspected horses raising in three Egyptian governorates at Northern Egypt were examined using SNAP®4DX® ELISA test. Overall, the seroprevalence of A. phagocytophilum was 11.1% (44/395), with highest rate found in Giza governorate 15.7%. The seroprevalence of A. phagocytophilum increased significantly in older animals, in thoroughbred horses and during summer. The multivariate logistic regression model revealed that age, thoroughbreds, summer season and presence of ectoparasites were identified as risk factors for A. phagocytophilum infection in horses. The results of this study confirmed the presence of antibodies against A. phagocytophilum in Egyptian horses. Thus, regular monitoring and genetic identification of pathogens are critical for implementing an effective control program and reducing public health risks. © 2024, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical indices in the saliva of leisure and sport horses undergoing different levels of workload. The experiment was conducted on 40 horses (4–28 years): sport horses (n = 20), and leisure horses (n = 20). The saliva samples were collected non-invasively 15 min before riding (A), 1 min before riding (B), 1 min after riding (C) and 15 min after riding (D). Albumin (Alb), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), α-amylase (AMY), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine (Crea), glucose (Glc), lactate (Lac), triacylglycerols (TG), total protein (TP), urea and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) were measured in saliva. Riding caused a significant change in many biochemical indices (Alb, CK, Glc, Lac, TBARS and urea) compared to baseline values in leisure horses (P < 0.05) but only in a few indices (Glc, Crea and TBARS) in sport horses. On the other hand, when comparing groups of leisure and sport horses, higher concentrations of Alb, Glc, TG and urea were found in sport horses whereas raised concentrations of CK and Crea were found in leisure horses. The obtained results indicate the adaptation of trained horses to physical effort. Moreover, this study confirms other possibilities of using salivary biochemical properties for physical stress assessment. Other more detailed comparative studies of load response in horses may provide useful information to quantify the reference range of individual stress indices. © 2024, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

ABSTRACT: After starting feeding on a new batch of hay, 29 out of 33 horses showed clinical signs of oral ulcerative and bleeding papules and mucous membrane erythema of the gingiva of the mandible within 2–3 days. The results of the complete blood cell count and biochemistry analysis did not yield significant findings in relation to horses affected by ulcerative stomatitis. Swab analyses of the oral mucosa for vesicular stomatitis virus (VS, Type Indiana and Type New Jersey) were negative in all horses (n = 33). Common windgrass with long awns in the deeper stomal-gingival ulcerations was confirmed through botanical analysis by botanical identification. The hay batch fed to the affected horses was assessed via botanical analysis, finding 15% common windgrass (Apera spica-venti). After the removal of the contaminated hay batch, full recovery was seen in all horses within 2–6 weeks depending on the severity of the lesions. The grassland from which the hay was harvested belonged to a semi-natural landscape restored to increase biodiversity and as a protection zone in case of overflow of the river Rhine. In conclusion, feeding forages harvested from these semi-natural landscapes may be harmful to the health of horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report the use of standing partial arytenoidectomy (PA) in draught horses affected by left-sided recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design: Retrospective descriptive study. Animals: Twenty-one draught horses diagnosed with left-sided recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Methods: Medical records of 21 draught horses subjected to standing PA to treat left-sided RLN were reviewed. Data recorded included history, signalment, presenting complaint, athletic or intended use, pre- and postoperative resting upper respiratory tract endoscopic findings, perioperative medication, surgical details, postoperative exercise recommendations and follow-up. Results: Twenty-one horses (100%) had a history of abnormal respiratory noise and 15 horses (71%) had exercise intolerance. Of the 19 horses with follow-up, surgery resolved or significantly reduced the abnormal respiratory noise in 17 horses (90%) and resolved exercise intolerance in all 13 horses with a history of exercise intolerance and follow-up. None of the horses had signs or evidence of coughing at the time of follow-up. Conclusion: Standing left-sided PA can resolve the clinical signs associated with left-sided RLN in draught horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Protection of horse welfare during transport is crucial. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of head and neck restraint on behavior and airway bacteria. Methods: In a randomized crossover study, six healthy Thoroughbreds were transported by road for 22 h in an individual bay with tight head restraint (50 cm short-rope) or loose head restraint (95 cm long-rope). Behavioral parameters relating to head position, eating, and stress were monitored during transportation. Tracheal wash samples were obtained 6 days before and immediately after transport for bacterial culture and metagenomic analysis. Results and discussion: Compared to before transport, bacterial load (CFU/mL) after transport was significantly increased in the short-rope group (p = 0.04), whereas no changes were observed in the long-rope group. Transport significantly reduced Simpson index at phylum, class, order, and family levels in both groups (p < 0.001) of tracheal microbiota. In both groups, this reduction was associated with increases in the dominant members of relative abundance at phylum (Firmicutes: +24% in long-rope and +14% in short-rope), class (Bacilli: +20% in long-rope and +22% in short-rope) and family (Streptococcaceae: +22% in long-rope and +23% in short-rope) levels. Licking behavior during transportation with short-rope restraint was more frequent than in horses with long-rope restraint. These results suggest loose head restraint during transportation is likely to ameliorate stress and mitigate the associated increased bacterial load in the lower airways associated with transport. Further, head position during transportation is likely a more important determinant of airway hygiene and distress than duration of travel.

ABSTRACT: Background: Reliable lameness thresholds for vertical head displacement for trotting on a circular path and on different surfaces have yet to be defined. Withers movement in lame horses could help improve the diagnostic accuracy of sensor technology. Objectives: To define head movement lameness threshold ranges and describe the relationship between head and withers movement during trotting under different circumstances in sound and forelimb lame horses. Study design: Retrospective analysis of clinical data and comparison with control group. Methods: Fifty-five sound and thirty-four naturally lame horses were trotted under field conditions on a hard surface on a straight line and on both directions on soft and hard surfaces. Movement asymmetry was analysed by measuring differences in displacement minima for head and withers using an inertial measurement unit sensor-based gait analysis system. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to define threshold ranges. Relationships between head and withers data were identified by calculating the correlation with linear regression analysis. Results: Estimated lameness threshold values for vertical head movement asymmetry ranged from 11.5 to 12.5 mm. On both surfaces, a head movement asymmetry threshold range from 24.5 to 26.5 mm could be found for the circle. Lame horses showed significant correlations between head and withers movement on hard ground straight line (R2 0.714, p < 0.001) and inner leg lame horses on the lunge (R2 0.915, p < 0.001). Main limitations: Different sources of lameness were not distinguished. Radius and speed during lungeing could not be perfectly controlled. Inclusion in the sound group was based on a subjective examination by one clinician and in the lame group two clinicians subjectively determined inner and outer leg lameness creating an extra amount of uncertainty. Conclusions: Lameness thresholds for quantifying head movement asymmetry on the lunge were proposed. A significant correlation was observed between head and withers movement asymmetry under several conditions. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Animal welfare is of great concern in equestrian sports and has been evaluated in athletic horses competing at different levels. However, the impact of consecutive days of jumping competition and the extent of resultant stress responses remains unclear. To address this point, the present study compared the changes in stress response via heart rate variability (HRV) in horses participating in two national jumping events on consecutive days. Methods: The study involved six experienced horses equipped with heart rate monitoring devices. HRV variables were measured before, during, and after jumping at 10-min intervals for 60 min on each competition day. Results: Multiple HRV variables decreased to varying degrees on both days from warm-up until 30 min post-jumping. Meanwhile, the mean heart rate increased during jumping and returned to normal levels at 50 min post-jumping on the first day (for all intervals, p < 0.05–0.001), while it remained elevated beyond 60 min post-jumping on the second day (for all intervals, p < 0.01–0.001). Additionally, maximum heart rate and respiratory rate were higher on the second day than in the first round during the warm-up phase (p < 0.05 for both variables). The proportion of the HRV low-frequency band was higher during riding on the second day (p < 0.05), while the proportion of the high-frequency band was reduced during warm-up on the first day (p < 0.05) and during course riding on the second (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, the sympathetic nervous system index took longer to return to baseline on the second day than on the first. Discussion: These results suggest that autonomic regulation differed in horses between jumping rounds on two consecutive days, with horses experiencing higher sympathetic activity and potentially increased stress in the second round. This information is important for riders, highlighting the need to be mindful of potential stress that could, at least in part, impact the welfare of horses participating in the same jumping competition on consecutive days.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine post-operative morbidity represents a significant concern for both veterinary surgeons and horse owners. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of post-operative complications in horses after elective/non-abdominal surgery or colic surgery. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: A database search identified eligible studies which reported the prevalence of equine post-operative complications published as a full paper in English in a peer-reviewed journal between 2000 and 2023. Studies were evaluated using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) framework. Data for the most commonly reported complications were analysed using Chi-squared analysis of weighted means to answer 13 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcomes) questions. Results: Sixty-seven studies met inclusion criteria. Data for eight post-operative morbidities (colic, surgical site complications, myopathy/neuropathy, laminitis, diarrhoea/colitis, fever/pyrexia, jugular thrombophlebitis/thrombosis, respiratory complications) were sufficient to allow statistical analyses. The weighted mean of the overall proportion of post-operative complications after elective/non-abdominal surgery is 17.48% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 13.20–22.92), significantly increasing to 55.62% (95% CI: 45.79–65.03) after colic surgery (odds ratio [OR] 6.63; 95% CI: 5.83–7.56; p < 0.001). The most commonly reported morbidity was post-operative colic, with a weighted mean prevalence of 7.45% (95% CI: 4.83–11.76) after elective/non-abdominal surgery, significantly rising to 26.46% (95% CI: 19.11–35.97) after colic surgery (OR 4.11; 95% CI: 3.60–4.71; p < 0.001). The weighted mean prevalence of surgical site complications, laminitis, diarrhoea/colitis, fever/pyrexia, jugular thrombophlebitis/thrombosis and respiratory complications were significantly higher after colic surgery compared with elective/non-abdominal surgery. Myopathy/neuropathy was the only morbidity where prevalence was not different between groups (OR 1.86; 95% CI: 0.86–4.16; p = 0.16). Main limitations: The majority of studies were retrospective. Morbidity definitions, data collection periods, follow-up time and methods varied between studies. Conclusions: Based on current evidence, the prevalence of post-operative colic, surgical site complications, laminitis, diarrhoea/colitis, fever/pyrexia, jugular thrombophlebitis/thrombosis and respiratory complications is significantly higher after colic surgery compared with elective/non-abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In order to find early selection criteria to improve the longevity of show jumping horses, a specific protocol was designed. Methods: Before entering competition, young horses selected from extreme stallions for longevity were measured for many traits, including blood parameters. Blood samples were taken from 952 horses aged 2–4 years old, sired by two groups of stallions: one with unfavorable (U) and the other with favorable (F) extreme estimated breeding values for functional longevity. These breeding values were previously calculated from data on 202,320 horses that participated in show jumping competitions between 1985 and 2022. Functional longevity was defined as time spent in competition, adjusted for the level of performance. The 59 measured parameters included hematology, proteins, cytokines, liver and kidney function, bone and joint health, oxidative stress and endocrinology. Heritability was estimated using a mixed model that accounted for the effect of age, sex, estimated weight, visit (place and date of collection), and animal random additive value with 10,280 horses in pedigree. A Partial Least Square logistic regression was performed to predict the sire group. Results: Age, sex and estimated weight significantly affected 36, 19 and 16 variables, respectively. The visit had a significant effect on all variables. Heritability estimates were high, with 75% higher than 0.20% and 30% higher than 0.50. The most heritable traits included mean corpuscular volume (0.92, se 0.11), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (0.90, se 0.11), white blood cells (0.55, se 0.13), total alkaline phosphatase (0.68, se 0.12) and percentage of γ-globulin (0.57, se 0.12). The logistic regression that predicted the group of sires favorable for longevity identified 16 significant variables. Key findings included: lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin (p-value < 0.001), lower mean corpuscular volume (p-value < 0.001), lower number of white blood cells (p-value < 0.01), higher percentage of intestinal and bone alkaline phosphatase (p-value < 0.01) for a lower total alkaline phosphatase (p-value < 0.01), higher percentage of α2-globulin (p-value < 0.001) and lower percentage of β1-globulin (p-value < 0.01). Discussion: Blood parameters measured at rest in young horses may be predictive of their genetic value for functional longevity in show jumping.

ABSTRACT: Horses employ a range of subtle to overt behaviours to communicate their current affective state. Humans who are more cognisant of their own bodily sensations may be more attuned to recognising affective states in horses (Equus caballus) thereby promoting positive human-horse interactions. This study investigated human ability to categorise human-horse interactions depicted in media relative to equine behaviour experts and compared participant scores to their level of interoception. Using an online survey, participants (n = 534) categorised 31 photographs and videos as (overt) positive, likely (subtle) positive, neutral, likely (subtle) negative or (overt) negative human-horse interactions from the horse’s point of view and completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (MAIA-2) to assess their level of interoception. Demographic information was also collected (age, gender, education, level of experience with horses, location). Participants differed from expert categorisations of horse affective states across all categories, exactly matching experts only 52.5% of the time and approximately matching experts for positive and negative valence 78.5% of the time. The MAIA-2 did not predict participant ability to accurately categorise human-horse interactions. Women outperformed men in categorising overt positive, overt negative and subtle negative human-horse interactions. Increased levels of education and greater experience with horses were associated with improved categorisation of certain human-horse interactions. More training or awareness is needed to recognise behavioural indicators of horse affect to guide appropriate human-horse activities that impact horse welfare. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are human antidiabetic drugs that are increasingly used in equine practice for the management of hyperinsulinaemia and hyperinsulinaemia-associated laminitis. However, the understanding of SGLT2i use in horses is in its infancy compared to human medicine. This review article aims to briefly examine the literature in both species, highlighting current knowledge gaps, potential similarities in therapeutic outcomes and possible adverse effects. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: For centuries, people have discussed the special bond between humans and horses, with research indicating that interacting with horses can improve both psychological and physiological well-being [1, 2]. Scientific studies have explored these interactions, revealing that activities such as grooming and riding horses not only foster emotional connection but also lead to measurable health benefits: reductions in systolic blood pressure and improvements in emotional well-being following interactions with horses [3]. The objective of this study was to compare heart rate, blood pressure, and bio-psychosocial satisfaction between non-riders and riders during daily activities and interactions with a horse. The study involved 22 participants, divided into two groups: 15 non-riders with an average age of 27.4 years, and 7 riders with an average age of 26.3 years. Measurements included 24-hour heart rate monitoring, blood pressure, bio-psychosocial satisfaction assessments, and evaluations of physical activities of varying intensities. Interactions with the horse, such as flattering, brushing, feeding, and riding, were also assessed. Data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation, the Mann-Whitney test, and the Wilcoxon test through SPSS and MATLAB. The results showed that non-riders had a higher heart rate compared with riders during horse interactions. For example, the non-riders’ median heart rate was 93.5 beats per minute while flattering, 97.5 beats per minute while brushing, and 100.5 beats per minute while feeding the horse. In contrast, the riders’ median heart rates during these activities were significantly lower, with 77 beats per minute during flattering, 85 beats per minute during brushing, and 84 beats per minute during feeding. In the non-riders’ group, the physical condition after the sessions with the horse increased more than the emotional state (P < 0.05). HR was higher when non-riders were flattering, brushing and feeding the horse compared with the low and medium daily physical activity (P < 0.05). The non-riders’ systolic blood pressure decreased and satisfaction of emotional well-being and social interaction increased (P < 0.05) after sessions with a horse. In conclusion, there were no significant differences in blood pressure or bio-psychosocial satisfaction between the two groups before interacting with the horse. However, non-riders experienced a higher heart rate during flattering, brushing, and feeding compared with riders. Additionally, non-riders showed a greater improvement in the physical condition after the sessions, while both groups reported increased emotional wellbeing and social satisfaction after interacting with the horse. © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija).

ABSTRACT: We estimated the Leptospira seroprevalence in dogs, cats, and horses from Tennessee, USA, using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) against 12 Leptospira serovars. We observed Leptospira seropositivity in 110 of 374 (29.4%) dogs, 21 of 170 (12.4%) cats, and 42 of 88 (47.7%) horses. The highest seroprevalence was observed for serovars Autumnalis (74.6%) in dogs, and Bratislava in cats (42.9%) and horses (95.2%). We found a significant level of potential cross-reactivity between multiple Leptospira serovars tested, with highest cross-reactivity to serovar Autumnalis in dogs. Leptospira seroprevalence was significantly higher in vaccinated dogs (45 of 98 [46%]) compared to unvaccinated dogs (14 of 86 [16%]; p < 0.001). A significant difference in seroprevalence was observed in vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs to all 4 serovars included in canine leptospiral vaccines (p < 0.001). We also evaluated the Leptospira testing results from our diagnostic laboratory submissions from 2021–2023; 103 of 252 (40%) canine serum samples were positive, with the highest positivity rate for serovar Autumnalis. On Leptospira real-time PCR, 35 of 325 (10.7%) urine samples and 15 of 257 (5.8%) blood samples were positive. The cross-reactivity between the Leptospira serovars used in the MAT and vaccination status should be considered when estimating seroprevalence. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: As owners and equine professionals, we tend to fall victim to measuring equine cognitive abilities by how much they resemble our own. We underestimate horses' abilities when they do not measure up to a human gold standard and overestimate these abilities when we think that horses should understand what we want, want the same thing, and therefore be justly punished when they do not comply. Here, I explore what we have learned from science about how horses think and the implications this has for equine practitioners in their boots on the ground interactions with horses. Knowledge about the behavioral and cognitive potential of the modern horse (not so different from their pre-domesticated ancestors of more than 6000years ago) can make for more accurate assessments of the needs and welfare status of horses kept in managed settings and improve horse-to-human interfaces, fostering improved equine welfare and greater safety for practitioners. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abnormal blood glucose (BG) levels often seen in critically ill horses are significantly associated with adverse patient outcomes and increased mortality. Rapid and accurate BG monitoring is now considered an essential component of evidence-based equine practice and can provide critical information quickly for treatment. Although several point-of-care (POC) BG monitoring hand-held devices are commercially available for veterinary use, none contains a unique algorithm validated for use in horses. The AlphaTrak 3 (AT3) BG monitoring system is a first-of-its-kind device with an equine-specific algorithm that allows stall-side clinical decision making, and frequent monitoring at minimal cost. As such, AT3 is potentially a preferred alternative to more costly and time-consuming standard diagnostic reference laboratory methods. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of the AT3 device in measuring BG levels in equine whole blood samples in comparison to results obtained by the Beckman Coulter AU480 reference analyzer per ISO15197:2013 specifications. Accuracy of the AT3 equine algorithm were initially verified by testing equine blood samples with artificially adjusted blood glucose levels followed by its validation in a field study. Testing with artificially adjusted equine samples (n = 129) showed that 98.9% of glucose measurements ranging from 29 to 479 mg/dL fell within ISO accuracy threshold of ±15 mg/dL or ±15% of the average reference value. In addition, 100% of the AT3 measurements fell in consensus error grid (CEG) zone A, which indicates that test outcomes have a minimal likelihood of adverse clinical impact. In a follow-up field study involving 96 horses, 98.4% of AT3 measurements met the ISO accuracy threshold and 99.2% of AT3 measurements fell in CEG zone A. These results demonstrate that the AT3 glucometer has a high degree of accuracy in horses and is a dependable, convenient, and cost-effective device for accurately monitoring equine BG levels in farm or clinical settings.

ABSTRACT: Quality of life is dependent upon the extent to which behavioural needs are met, and the balance between pleasant and unpleasant lifetime experiences. In Part II of this systematic review, articles (n = 109) relating to horse-human interactions were reviewed to identify behavioural evidence of their positive or negative impact on the horse. The number of articles (n = 22) relating to the recognition of pain in horses, indicated the importance of identifying health issues, which are also likely to increase the aversiveness of interactions. These and articles relating to emotional reactivity testing in horses (n = 19), the behaviour of horses during handling and management procedures (n = 17), behaviour of the horse when ridden (n = 17), non-procedural horse-human interactions (n = 13), horse behaviour during transportation (n = 12) and behaviour during training other than when ridden (n = 9) were reviewed. During most interactions, horse behaviour is controlled and/or restricted by the human, masking negative or positive signs, and may be confounded by factors including fear and individual differences. In situations involving freedom of movement, positive experiences of horses with humans were associated with approach behaviour, negative ones with avoidance, but training could affect both. Undoubtedly, change is needed to reduce the extent to which interactions with humans are unpleasant for the horse. Only when the needs of the horse are fulfilled and interactions with humans are predominantly pleasurable will their quality of life improve. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Adolescence is one of the most difficult periods of life. When teens struggle with behavioural or mental health issues, their actions are a cry for help. Most of the time, they still lack the emotional maturity or development necessary to express themselves properly, so their response to a stimulus often worsens already bad situations. Through equine relationship therapy, adolescents can gain self-esteem and essential life skills that help them achieve success, have a strong work ethic, and have other positive and lasting traits. Art therapy is also used for adolescents, which helps them express and understand their feelings better. By combining art and equine therapies and applying them to teenagers, better results can be obtained in solving various types of problems. So, the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of horse-assisted art therapy sessions on adolescents. The study included 8 teenagers (11–16 years old) and 5 horses (5–18 years old). During the three sessions, the body language of the horses was assessed, and its expression was scored when the subjects drew on the horse during art therapy. The pulse variability of the horses was assessed with an Equine Polar heart rate monitor. To assess the differences more accurately between age groups of teenagers, the subjects were divided into two groups (Group 1, 11–13 years old, and Group 2, 14–16 years old). They were assessed for the level of stress experienced using the PSS-1O test, which consisted of ten questions. The results showed changing body language scores of horses between different sessions; however, while working with teenagers during art therapy, they changed slightly or increased in favour of humans during the sessions as the horses got used to the subjects and their actions (P < 0.05). Older horses were calmer than younger horses. The heart rate of horses when working with teenagers during art therapy varied depending on their body language (P > 0.05). The results showed that older teenagers (14–16 years old) experienced more stress, tended to show different types of emotions, and discovered the horse as a communication partner, while younger teenagers (11–13 years old) evaluated everything only through the prism of positive emotions. The study suggests that horses adapt positively to human interaction during art therapy sessions with teenagers, with older horses displaying greater composure. The correlation between horse body language and heart rate highlights the importance of nonverbal communication in these interactions. Furthermore, it indicates age-related differences in the emotional experiences of teenagers, with older participants exhibiting more varied emotions and viewing horses as communication partners, contrasting with the predominantly positive outlook of younger teenagers. © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija).

ABSTRACT: Sports horse breeding is currently most oriented towards the high-performance abilities. This becomes a challenge for small and closed populations. The aim of our study was to determine the performance characteristics of different genotypes present in the Lithuanian Trakehner horse population. Trakehner Horse Breeders Association and Agricultural Data Center provided the data of Trakehner horse evaluations since 1999. The data of 435 protocols of Trakehner horse evaluations at the age of 3 and more years old were analysed. In the protocol walk, trot, canter and free–jumping movements were rated from 1 to 10. Mean and standard deviation values of the scores were calculated for mares and stallions within separate horse genotypes. The genotypes were formed on the basis of Trakehner horse lines described by Kamzolov [1]. All horses were sorted according to pedigree and assigned to the related horse group in accordance with the founders of the stallion lines. The stallion lines were divided within genealogical clusters on the basis of the founder's breed. When describing the lines of old Trakehnen stud, the stallions of Pilger through Einhard line stood out with higher ratings of trot movements (7.0 ± 0.5) and jumping quality (7.4 ± 0.8). The mares of Pilger through Port Arthur were rated at canter movements for 7.0 ± 0.47 and at jumping for 7.5 ± 0.6. Stallions of the Dampfross through Hyperion line were scored the highest for the quality of trot and canter movements, 7.2 ± 0.6 and 7.1 ± 0.6, respectively, while ratings of mares jumping quality reached 7.5 ± 0.6. The stallions of Dampfross through Pythagoras line were also highly rated for jumping quality (7.3 ± 0.5). In the related groups, whose lines were introduced by thoroughbred stallions, the progeny of Saint Cloud group stood out for particularly well-rated walk and trot movements (from 7.1 to 7.7), but they were poorly rated for jumping quality (stallions 6.1 ± 0.6; mares 6.3 ± 0.3). Stallions of the Bay Ronald through Gainsborough line were distinguished by the highest jumping rating, which was 7.5 ± 0.6. The stallions and mares of Prince Rose line showed high ratings for the quality of walk movements (7.3 ± 0.7 and 7.5 ± 0.6, respectively), and the mares were distinguished in the evaluation of canter movements and jumping (7.3 ± 0.6 and 7.4 ± 0.5, respectively). The stallions of Langraf line were rated higher in canter movement and jumping (7.1 ± 0.6 and 7.2 ± 0.6, respectively), while the mares of Nasrullah line stood out with the highest rating of jumping (7.8 ± 0.8). In conclusion, the progeny of all stallion lines originating from old Trakehnen Stud were versatile and rated well for jumping, walk and trot movements. Meanwhile, the progeny of some thoroughbred stallion lines was better rated for walk and trot and some thoroughbred stallion lines were exceptional due to highest rates of jumping. In order to improve the performance of Trakehner horses, it is appropriate to use stallions of Dampfross (especially through Hyperion), Pilger through Einhard, Bay Ronald through Gainsborough and Landgraf lines in mating with typical Trakehner mares. © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija).

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Various draft horse breeds, especially breeds with abundant feathering on the lower limbs, are known to be susceptible to chorioptic mange. Clinical signs of chorioptic mange encompass intense pruritus leading to self-mutilation and hair loss, thickening of the epidermis, and the formation of hyperkeratotic crusts and scabs. Despite the frequent occurrence and high impact of this condition, treatment options are limited, with a conspicuous absence of registered products formulated for equines, and especially foals. This limited availability of approved products highlights the necessity for alternative approaches to effectively address chorioptic mange in draft horse populations, given the severity of the clinical signs and their negative impact on the well-being of infested horses. Methods: Two 9-months old Belgian draft horse foals with clinical signs of severe pruritus and skin scaling on the distal legs were included. Both horses tested positive for living mites by means of superficial skin scrapings. Topical treatment with ivermectin at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight was applied twice with 1 week interval, directly onto the distal legs of the horses. Results: In both cases, the mites were morphologically identified as Chorioptes bovis. Negative scrapings were obtained 7 days after the second treatment. Pruritus resolved in both horses within 2 days after the first treatment. Clinical signs consisting of skin scaling and crusting in the pastern region had resolved as well at 1 week and 3 weeks after the second treatment, respectively. Conclusion: This case report presents the first successful treatment of two clinical cases of chorioptic mange in Belgian draft horse foals with 1 mg/kg topical ivermectin, applied directly onto the distal legs.

ABSTRACT: This study explored the maternal genetic diversity of six indigenous Indian horse and pony breeds (Bhutia, Kathiawari, Manipuri, Marwari, Spiti, and Zanskari) using comprehensive mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) analysis. Blood samples from 53 horses across diverse agro-climatic zones of India were analyzed, revealing 36 distinct haplotypes, with a haplotype diversity of 0.889 and nucleotide diversity of 0.00347. These indices suggest significant maternal genetic diversity in Indian equines. A median-joining (MJ) network, based on the hypervariable region of the D-loop along with sequences of Indian equids retrieved from the NCBI, identified 55 haplotypes, including shared haplotypes across 2–5 breeds. Hierarchical AMOVA analysis revealed that 95.20% of genetic variation was within populations, while only 4.80% was among different groups, indicating minimal genetic structuring based on geographic distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of these mitogenomes, alongside global sequences, revealed significant genetic variability without clear geographic clustering, highlighting extensive gene flow and interbreeding across regions. Median-Joining network based on D-loop sequence revealed that Indian horses conform to seven of the 18 globally recognized haplogroups (A, B, G, J, L, M, and P), with haplogroup A being the most frequent. This research contributes to the broader understanding of equine genetic diversity, aligning with global patterns of extensive maternal haplotype diversity, and underscores the intricate genetic backgrounds resulting from historical breeding practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: An 8-y-old National Show Horse mare was presented for evaluation of pneumonia and laminitis. Harsh bronchovesicular sounds were auscultated throughout both lung fields, and the mare had signs of moderately painful laminitis. Thoracic ultrasonography revealed lung consolidation throughout the dorsal aspect of both lungs, and radiography revealed an extensive diffuse-to-patchy bronchointerstitial lung pattern. The mare’s clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, and euthanasia was elected. On postmortem examination, the lungs, omentum, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, and femur contained 0.5–2.5-cm, firm, tan nodules. Histologically, the lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, omentum, left eye, and femur were infiltrated by bundles and nests of pleomorphic polygonal-to-spindloid cells intermixed with frequent multinucleate cells. Lymphatic vessels in the affected tissues were frequently distended with tumor emboli. Neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for vimentin, desmin, sarcomeric actin, myoblastic differentiation protein 1, and myogenin, supportive of the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), which is a rare neoplasm in horses. Cross-striations were not evident with H&E or phosphotungstic acid–hematoxylin stains. Markedly pleomorphic neoplastic cells, multinucleate cells, and lack of cross-striations suggested the subclassification of pleomorphic RMS. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Climate change caused by global warming forces more and more attention to the use of renewable energy resources. Biogas production from organic waste is considered one of the most correct and environmentally friendly technologies. Various organic wastes are used as raw materials. If this waste has to be transported over longer distances, it is advantageous to granulate it. It has been proven that more gas can be obtained from granules than from non-granulated raw materials during anaerobic fermentation. In this study, it was determined how much biogas (biomethane) can be obtained from pellets of horse manure and three different bedding mixtures. The amount of biogas (biomethane) production was studied in a laboratory device with 16 bioreactors. Their volume was 0.75 liters each. Three different mixtures of horse manure and litter were prepared: a) with fine sawdust (<1mm) and hay and straw residues (M1) b) with a large amount of hay and straw (also long) (M2) c) with coarse sawdust and hay and straw residues (M3). The bioreactors were placed in a thermostat and the operating temperature was set to 38ºC. The study lasted for 30 days. The following results were obtained: 0.451 (0.203) L·g-1DOM of biogas (biomethane) was obtained from mixture M1; mixture M2 yielded 0.494 (0.212) L·g-1DOM of biogas (biomethane) and mixture M3 yielded 0.468 (0.253) L·g-1DOM of biogas (biomethane). In two bioreactors with M3 mixture pellets the enzyme concentrate Metha Plus was added. Its addition improved biogas (biomethane) production: 0.497 (0.278) L·g-1DOM. The study showed that all three mixtures are well suited for biogas (biomethane) production. © 2024 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study describes a case of poisoning by pyrrolizidine alkaloids in a horse. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of Senecio ovatus poisoning. A six-year-old 450-kg Irish cob mare was presented to the Equine Clinic of the University of Veterinary Sciences Brno (Czechia) with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, which progressively worsened with time despite intensive therapy and led to euthanasia. A complex diagnostic and therapeutic approach including the post-mortem patoanatomical and histopathological examination is described here. Regarding the histopathology of the liver, there was necrosis with haemorrhage, fatty changes and inflammation. A later inspection of the grazing area revealed the presence of Senecio ovatus (wood ragwort). A sensitive chromatographic method was used to determine the pyrrolizidine alkaloids and their metabolites in the plasma and the liver. In both of the samples, metabolites of pyrrolizidine alkaloids were detected. Although pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning was proven, the histopathological findings typical for this disease were absent. It is clear from our case that the histopathology in cases of poisoning by pyrrolizidine alkaloids may not always be conclusive. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In adult horses, the development and evaluation of enteral electrolyte solutions containing sodium acetate for correcting hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis are still lacking, although these electrolyte and acid–base imbalances are commonly observed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the alkalinizing effect of two enteral electrolyte solutions containing different concentrations of acetate, administered via nasogastric tube in continuous flow, in adult horses with experimental hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Methods: Six mares aged between 3 and 10 years were used in a 6×2 crossover design, with each animal receiving both treatments. The horses were subjected to a protocol to induce hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. They then received one of two treatments: HighAcetate (81.4 mmol/L) and LowAcetate (22.7 mmol/L) at an infusion rate of 15 mL/kg/h for 12 h. Plasma, serum, and urinary biochemical assessments; hematocrit; urinary volume, pH, and specific gravity; and blood gas analysis were measured at the following time points: T-12 h (beginning of the 12-h fast), T0h (end of fasting and beginning of the acidosis induction phase), every 2 h during the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis induction phase (Ti2h and Ti4h), every 2 h during the 12-h enteral hydration phase (Tt2h, Tt4h, Tt6h, Tt8h, Tt10h, and Tt12h), with one sample taken at T24h (24 h after the start of acidosis induction) and another at T36h (36 h after the start of acidosis induction). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance based on a factorial design of repeated measures, with Tukey’s post-hoc test or the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test for non-parametric tests. Results: At the end of the induction phase, the animals developed moderate to severe hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The HighAcetate solution effectively corrected electrolyte and acid–base imbalances before the end of the treatment phase (Tt12h), while the LowAcetate solution was not effective in correcting those changes. Conclusion: The HighAcetate (81.4 mmol/L) solution is deemed an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in horses.

ABSTRACT: Motivation: In single-cell studies, principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used to reduce the dimensionality of dataset and visualize in 2D or 3D PC plots. Scientists often focus on different clusters within PC plot, overlooking the specific phenomenon, such as horse-shoe-like effect, that may reveal hidden knowledge about underlying biological dataset. This phenomenon remains largely unexplored in single-cell studies. Results: In this study, we investigated into the horse-shoe-like effect in PC plots using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. We systematically explain horse-shoe-like phenomenon from various inter-related perspectives. Initially, we establish an intuitive understanding with the help of simulated datasets. Then, we generalized the acquired knowledge on real biological scRNA-seq data. Experimental results provide logical explanations and understanding for the appearance of horse-shoe-like effect in PC plots. Furthermore, we identify a potential problem with a well-known theory of ‘distance saturation property’ attributed to induce horse-shoe phenomenon. Finally, we analyse a mathematical model for horse-shoe effect that suggests trigonometric solutions to estimated eigenvectors. We observe significant resemblance after comparing the results of mathematical model with simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets.

ABSTRACT: The study aimed to explore the connection between horses’ total tract apparent dry matter digestibility (ttaDMD) of various roughages and faecal particle size (FPS), to develop a tool to rank roughage digestibility. Six horses, varying in size and breed, were fed six distinct roughages (four cuts of fescue, perennial ryegrass/clover mix, and straw). Each feeding period lasted 16 days, with a 14-day adaptation phase. Faecal samples underwent wet sieving analysis. Roughage chemical composition was evaluated using NIRs. Faecal and roughage acid insoluble ash content were used to estimate ttaDMD and FPS was determined by wet sieving using a set of 6 sieves of different mesh sizes (S1 to S6; 6.50, 4.50, 2.36, 1.18, 0.6 and 0.15 mm respectively). The effects of roughage ttaDMD on FPS across sieves were analysed using GLM. Linear regressions and correlations were performed between faecal residues on each sieve and mesh sizes of the sieves to create a mathematical tool to rank ttaDMD based on FPS distribution. Increased ttaDMD was associated with larger FPS, with perennial ryegrass/clover mix (ttaDMD 74.44%) and straw (ttaDMD 44.57%) resulting in smaller and larger faecal particles respectively. Correlations were observed between ttaDMD, S1 and S2 (r = 0.639 and 0.668; p ≤ 0.001). The angular coefficient of the linear function between faecal residues on each sieve support the idea to estimate roughages digestibility from FPS (R2 = 0.4153). Consequently, determining faecal residues across sieves of varying mesh sizes could serve as an indirect method for ranking roughages digestibility. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The aims of this study were to first determine the extent of owners’ fundamental knowledge of equine care, second, gain their opinions on the implementation of a mandatory certificate of knowledge and third, to investigate the association of certification on horse owner knowledge. An online survey comprising 23 questions (18 closed, 5 open) was distributed worldwide via snowball sampling, and completed by 1847 horse owners who were all ≥18 years old from 17 different countries. Almost all (96%, n = 1781) completed surveys were usable. Just over half (52%) of participants held a current equine knowledge certification, and 59% believed a mandatory certificate of knowledge should be necessary to buy, own, or sell a horse. Horse owners with an equine certificate of knowledge were more likely to be in favor of a mandatory certificate (Pearson’s Chi-squared = 50.79, df = 1, p < 0.0001). The mean correctly answered knowledge questions was 68%, indicating that approximately 1/3 of horse owners lacked fundamental horse care knowledge. Further examination indicated that participating horse owners showed the least understanding in the behavioral interactions domain (ANOVA F(4, 24) = 4.98, p < 0.01), specifically in relation to pain recognition and learning theory terminology. Arguably, this deficit in knowledge and likely correct application increases the risk of owners using misinformed or inappropriate techniques to manage horse behavior and training, predisposing the horse to experiencing a sub-optimal quality of life. Overall no significant difference was found between the total correct scores of horse owners with or without a certificate (ANOVA F(1, 56) = 0.78, p > 0.05); however, a series of Chi-squared tests revealed that for the more complex questions, horse owners with a certificate scored better than those without (all p < 0.05). Further work is needed to develop an evidence-based assessment framework if mandatory certification of horse owners is to become an effective tool for improving horse welfare and quality of life. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Noma horses are native Japanese horses. Health checkups revealed that many Noma horses developed dermatitis during summer, which subsided in winter. Seasonal development and signs of itching, suggestive of allergic dermatitis, were observed. In this study, allergen-specific IgE was measured using blood samples collected from 15 Noma horses in summer and winter to identify allergens highly associated with dermatitis. The presence of dermatitis in the subject individuals was recorded during blood sample collection. White blood cell and eosinophil counts, serum total IgE concentration, and serum allergen-specific IgE units (ARUs) were measured. White blood cell and eosinophil counts were significantly higher in horses with dermatitis in summer compared to winter. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in serum total IgE concentration regardless of the presence of dermatitis or the season. Horses with dermatitis in summer showed higher ARUs derived from red ants, horseflies, biting midges, cockroaches, deerflies, and mosquitoes than those in winter. These ARUs were positively correlated with white blood cell and eosinophil counts. The factor analysis results suggested that sensitization to some insects, such as mosquitoes and deerflies, may be a cause of dermatitis. In conclusion, insect-derived allergens could be associated with the onset of dermatitis in Noma horses. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Lawsonia intracellularis is the etiological agent behind equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE), recently identified and emerging intestinal ailment in horses. Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular, curved, gram-negative bacterium that resides within the apical cytoplasm of infected intestinal enterocytes. Although serological studies on EPE have been conducted in several countries, the prevalence of Lawsonia intracellularis in Korea has not been reported. This study aimed to examine the seroprevalence of Lawsonia intracellularis among healthy Thoroughbred horses in Korea. In this study, 180 healthy adult Thoroughbred horses (≥2 years of age) and 8 foals (<2 years of age) were sampled from each of the four Korean provinces.Antibodies against Lawsonia intracellularis were assessed using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among adult horses, 78.9% (142/180) tested positive, 20% (36/180) yielded inconclusive results, and 1.1% (2/180) tested negative. Among foals, 87.5% (7/8) tested positive with 12.5% (1/8) yielding inconclusive data. The findings of this study hold significant implications in identifying the serological infection status of Lawsonia intracellularis among domestically bred Thoroughbred horses and establishing fundamental data regarding this infection in Korea. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications).

ABSTRACT: The lumbo-pelvic hip complex (LPHC) plays a pivotal role in equestrian sports, connecting the rider’s body to the horse’s back and influencing rider-horse interaction. Achieving an ideal ‘independence of seat’ characterised by balanced, elastic, and upright posture is representative of rider expertise. While previous studies have examined aspects of rider-horse coordination, the relationship between rider ankle range of motion (ROM) and shock attenuation at the LPHC remains mostly unexplored. Eight experienced dressage dyads participated, and their ankle ROM was measured using a goniometer while accelerometers recorded saddle and rider sacrum accelerations during 20 extended sitting trot strides. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.71, P < 0.01) was observed between ankle ROM and saddle-rider’s sacrum increase in shock signal strength, indicating that greater ankle ROMs correlated to worse dampening capacities of experienced riders. Ankle ROM may have implications for the rider’s and horse welfare and performance. Understanding the role of ankle mobility provides valuable insights for coaching and training programs in equestrian sports. © M. Elmeua González and N. Šarabon, 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Weaning represents one of the most stressful events in the life of a horse, and may have long-term impacts on behaviour. There are a range of approaches used to wean foals from mares, including abrupt and progressive separation methods. There is currently a lack of consensus on how stress and impact are measured. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review to identify and chart measures of weaning-related stress on the mare and foal. Study design: Scoping review. Methods: The scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. Systematic searches were conducted in three scientific databases (CAB abstracts, Medline and Embase). The title, abstract and full text of retrieved studies were reviewed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Publications that remained after full text review were analysed. Data on study design, population characteristics, weaning method and health and behavioural outcomes were extracted and charted. Results: A total of 366 publications were identified; 22 were retained for inclusion and charting. Eighteen studies reported behavioural measures, four only reported physiological measures and 12/22 studies used a combination of both. Fifteen studies analysed foal behaviour only (15/22), six analysed foals with their dams and one analysed the mare only. Duration of most studies (19/22) was a maximum of 12 months post weaning; three studies continued measurements until the foal age was 3–4 years old. Main limitations: Limited number of studies available for analysis. Conclusions: There is significant variation in the current evidence around weaning-related impacts in the mare and foal. This includes variation in how weaning methods and management of mares and foals are described, and very limited research evaluating long-term impacts, or the impact on the mare. This scoping review makes recommendations on how to improve the future evidence base. © 2024 The Author(s). Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Streptococcus equi (S. equi subsp equi and S. equi subsp zooepidemicus) in the state of Santa Catarina and evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates. For this, 420 nasal swab samples were collected from randomly selected horses. Isolation and phenotypic characterization of the bacteria were performed by sowing on 5% sheep blood agar, followed by analysis of morphotinctorial characteristics and biochemical analysis. To differentiate the main beta-hemolytic Streptococcus in horses, the fermentation profiles of the sugar’s lactose, maltose, sorbitol, and trehalose were used, which were confirmed at the subspecies level by the PCR technique. The antimicrobial susceptibility panel was defined by the disk diffusion method, testing 13 antimicrobials from ten different classes, all regularly used in equine medical clinics, followed by the calculation of the multiple antimicrobial resistance index. Ten strains of S. equi were isolated, with a prevalence of 2.38% (10/420). Of the total positive samples, 3% (3/10) were confirmed as belonging to S. equi subsp equi and 70% (7/10) were confirmed as belonging to S. zooepidemicus. Multidrug resistance was observed in 60% (6/10) of isolates. The antimicrobial with the greatest resistance was clindamycin with 70% (7/10), followed by beta-lactams, with 40% (4/10) resistance to penicillin and 30% (3/10) to ceftiofur. The isolates were 100% (10/10) sensitive to gentamicin, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. This was the first study carried out in the state, and based on these data, it can be said that Santa Catarina has a low prevalence of S. equi and the presence of multi-resistant strains of S. equi was confirmed in the equine herd in Santa Catarina. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Kurdish horse is one of the most valuable and original pure genetic reserves in Iran. According to historical evidence, this breed dates back to more than 2,500 years ago. In this population, genetic variations were analyzed using 17 microsatellite markers recommended by International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG). Genomic DNAs were extracted from the hair roots of 761 Kurdish horses. DNA fragments were amplified by multiplex PCR reaction using fluorescently labeled primers, and determined by capillary electrophoresis. Average number of alleles per locus was 4.29 (from 6 alleles in HTG7 to 17 alleles in ASB17). The mean value of the observed heterozygosity was 0.721, ranging from 0.491 (HTG7) to 0.838 (VHL20), while expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.523 (HTG7) to 0.839 (VHL20) with a mean of 0.752. The PIC value was from 0.708 (HMS6) to 0.856 (ASB17) with a mean of 0.782. The inbreeding coefficient ranged from 0.012 (ASB2) to 0.183 (HTG6) with a mean of 0.040. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P< 0.05) was found in 11 loci. The total exclusion probability of the 17 microsatellite loci was 0.9999. Kurdish horse revealed bottleneck event under two models of microsatellite evolution for sign and standardized differences for Infinite Alleles Model (IAM) and Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM). Based on this study, the effectiveness of 17 microsatellite markers for parentage verification and assignment test of Kurdish horse is confirmed. These results may facilitate conservation programs for the studied breeds and raise preserve their genetic variation. © 2024, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine asthma in severe form (severe equine asthma [sEA]) shares remarkable similarities with human asthma. Human studies detected changes in the autonomic nervous system function in asthmatic patients based on heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. Study design: Observational study. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between sEA and HRV in horses. Methods: Twenty horses diagnosed with sEA and 20 asymptomatic (non-sEA) horses were investigated. SEA horses showed clinical signs. The RR intervals of the ECG were recorded for 1 h at rest between 9 AM and 11 AM using a heart rate (HR) monitor. HRV data were calculated using Kubios software. Parameters recorded for the sEA and non-sEA groups were compared using one-way MANOVA model. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. Results: SD2 (mean 99.6 ± SD 25.3 vs. 42.5 ± 17.1), SDNN (82.7 ± 20.7 vs. 41.3 ± 14.3), TINN (398.1 ± 104.9 vs. 209.3 ± 71.9), SD2/SD1 ratio (1.7 ± 0.2 vs. 1.1 ± 0.3), Total power (4740.2 ± 1977.9 vs. 1503.0 ± 1179.3), LF (2415.3 ± 1072.4 vs. 707.4 ± 649.9), SD1 (60.9 ± 15.9 vs. 39.2 ± 14.1), RMSSD (86.0 ± 22.6 vs. 55.3 ± 19.8) and HF (1575.8 ± 902.5 vs. 578.1 ± 491.1) were lower in sEA horses compared with the non-sEA horses (p < 0.01 for each variable). SD2, SDNN, TNN, the SD2/SD1 ratio and Total power showed the greatest discriminatory power in differentiating the sEA and non-sEA groups. Main limitations: Small sample size. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that like humans, asthmatic horses show an overall reduction in autonomic control. A relative increase of the parasympathetic modulation of the heart was also observed. After further investigations, HRV measurement might be a non-invasive approach to monitor autonomic nervous system responses of sEA horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Aim: The use of osilodrostat, developed as a medication for Cushing's disease but categorized as an anabolic agent, is banned in horses by both the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities and the Fédération Equestre Internationale. For doping control purposes, elimination profiles of hydrolyzed osilodrostat in horse urine were established and the detectability of free forms of osilodrostat and its major metabolite, mono-hydroxylated osilodrostat (M1c), was investigated. Materials & methods: Post-administration urine samples obtained from a gelding and three mares were analyzed to establish the elimination profiles of osilodrostat using a validated method involving efficient enzymatic hydrolysis followed by LC/ESI–HRMS analysis. Results: Applying the validated quantification method with an LLOQ of 0.05 ng/ml, hydrolyzed osilodrostat could be quantified in post-administration urine samples from 48 to 72 h post-administration; by contrast, both hydrolyzed osilodrostat and M1c were detected up to 2 weeks. In addition, confirmatory analysis identified the presence of hydrolyzed osilodrostat for up to 72 h post-administration. Conclusion: For doping control purposes, we recommend monitoring both hydrolyzed M1c and osilodrostat because of the greater detectability of M1c and the availability of a reference material of osilodrostat, which is essential for confirmatory analysis. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The non-psychoactive cannabinoids cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) are available on the market in different forms, mostly for their anti-inflammatory and potential analgesic properties. These substances are prohibited during equine competitions. CBD and CBDA are naturally present in hemp straw, commonly used as a bedding substitute for wheat straw. Unfortunately, horses can eat it, which therefore could lead to a possible risk of positive findings for CBD/CBDA in biological samples after doping control tests. The goals of this study were, first, to provide recommendations on the use of hemp straw before competition and, second, to assess if discrimination between hemp bedding exposure and CBD oil administration is possible. Several CBD equine in vivo studies have been conducted, including one on hemp straw used as bedding and one after administration of CBD oil by topical and sublingual routes. In hemp straw, CBDA was detected in higher quantities than CBD, and other cannabinoids have been observed. After hemp straw exposure, CBDA was also detected in higher quantities than CBD in all urine samples. It appeared that hemp straw should not be used as bedding for equine competition except if a delay of at least 48 h is respected. Regarding the CBD oil product analysis, CBD was the main compound detected. After administration, 7-hydroxy CBD was identified in the urine. In conclusion, based on these data, we highlighted that it could be possible to discriminate the exposure of a horse to hemp straw from an administration of a CBD oil product thanks to the main presence of CBDA. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In recent years, prices for veterinary care have received considerable attention in mainstream media, yet scientific literature has not delved into actual figures. This study aims to elucidate veterinary care costs for dogs, cats, and horses across five countries [Sweden (SE), Norway (NO), Denmark (DK), United Kingdom (UK), and Ireland (IR, with limited data)] through web searches. Methods: Utilising online business directories, we located URLs featuring veterinary care prices in autumn 2022, and repeated tri-monthly five times. Vetpris.se (VP), a price comparison site for SE, NO, and DK, emerged from the search. Additionally, we sought to compare price data from veterinary clinics (ranging from animal hospitals to small private clinics) using a similar approach to VP. We targeted elective procedures (e.g., gonadectomy, GDY) and common procedures (e.g., pyometra surgery in dogs). Results: Comparing data from the same clinics’ websites and from VP within extraction from autumn 2022 to winter 2023/2024, median prices for dog and cat GDY were largely consistent. By October 2023, median prices for male cat GDY ranged from €72 (SE) to €230 (DK), and €130 (SE) to €361 (DK) for females; for dog GDY from €390 (SE) to €599 (DK) for males, and €461 (UK) to €1015 (DK) for females. Across sources, median prices for cat and dog GDY increased by 2–24% over a year for procedures with at least 10 clinics per extraction. Equine GDY (per sedation and local analgaesia) in SE saw a 64% increase by year-end, with a median price of €492. Emergency surgeries during regular-hours (e.g., pyometra and caesarean section) in SE were approximately €2,300 at the last extraction, marking a 27% increase for pyometra surgery during regular-hours and 15% after-hours compared to the previous year. Variability existed within and across countries and diagnoses/procedures. Discussion: Cross-validation suggested VP generally provided reliable information, though data points for emergencies were limited. Our web searching tool necessitated extensive manual verification, indicating room for further development. We recommend enhancing price transparency for animal owners to become better informed about the cost of veterinary care and be able to make informed choices.

ABSTRACT: The present study investigated the seropositivity rate of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) in domestic and working animals in Namibia, which included dogs, cats, horses, and donkeys. HEV poses a growing threat as a significant cause of human hepatitis globally and has several genotypes of varying zoonotic potential. As epidemiological data on the seroprevalence of HEV in Namibia is scarce, a serosurvey was conducted on archived serum samples of 374 dogs, 238 cats, 98 horses, and 60 donkeys collected between 2018 and 2022 from different regions, to assess the potential of these animals as sources of HEV infection. The findings revealed that 10.43% (n = 39/374) canine and 5.88% (n = 14/238) feline samples tested positive for HEV antibodies, whereas no seropositivity was detected in horses and donkeys. The study further examined the risk factors associated with HEV seropositivity, including animal sex, age, and geographical region, and noted a higher prevalence in dogs living in areas with intensive pig farming. Although there is no direct evidence indicating that these animals served as major reservoirs for HEV transmission to humans, the study underscores the importance of preventive measures to minimize contact exposure with pets considering the potential zoonotic risk, especially for susceptible risk groups. Further research is needed to explore the zoonotic potential of domestic animals and the epidemiological links between animal and human HEV transmissions in Namibia.

ABSTRACT: Silent heat is a condition in which livestock does not show symptoms of heat but physiologically estrus occurs due to low concentrations of the estrogen. Vitamins are small organic compounds that are needed by horses for the process of development, reproduction, and activity. Vitamin preparations are easily obtained and economically for breeders. This research aimed to observe differences in estrogen concentrations in postpartum silent heat gayo horses before and after therapy using intramuscularly vitamins A, D, E. Four of six gayo mares suspected of postpartum silent heat after diagnosis using ultrasound were used in this study. Four gayo mares were divided into two groups, the control group (K1, n=1) was only injected with NaCl and the therapy group (K2, n=3) was injected with vitamins A, D, E intramuscularly twice with an interval of one week. Blood plasma samples were collected before and after therapy for 7 days, then stored in the freezer at -20°C for analysis of estrogen concentrations using EIA. Data before and after therapy were analyzed using paired sample t-test and data between groups were reported descriptively. The results showed that the estrogen concentration of postpartum silent heat gayo horses in K1 was not significantly different (P>0.05) before and after NaCl injection (251.71±57.90 vs 255.56±84.14 pg/ml), while there was a significant difference in K2 (P<0.05) before and after vitamin A, D, E therapy (194.82±56.64 vs 557.11±96.55 pg/ml). Descriptively, there were differences in the concentration of the hormone estrogen in K1 and K2 after postpartum silent heat therapy. The conclusion is postpartum silent heat therapy using vitamins A, D, E in gayo horses can increase the concentration of the hormone estrogen in the estrous phase which has an impact on the appearance of estrus symptoms that is more clearly and easily observed by breeders. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The presence of intestinal parasites influences equines' well-being and working performance. However, the scenario of parasitism in working horses in the lowlands of Nepal is yet to be explored. The present study aimed to reveal the prevalence and diversity of intestinal parasites (protozoa and helminths) and to list the zoonotic species in working horses in the lowlands of Nepal. Fresh fecal samples (N=102) from horses were collected at two locations (Chitwan and Birgunj) in the lowlands of Terai and were transferred to the research laboratory. Coproscopy was carried out via direct wet mount, formalin ethyl acetate (FEA) sedimentation, saturated salt flotation, and acid-fast staining techniques. Coproscopy revealed an overall prevalence rate of 90.2% (92/102) with 15 known diverse species of parasites (Protozoa: 5 and Helminths: 10) and an unknown coccidian, out of which eight possess zoonotic potential. The prevalence and diversity of intestinal parasites were higher in adult than in young animals (90.7%; 15spp. vs. 88.9%; 11 spp.) The overall prevalence of helminths was double that of protozoa (89.2% vs. 43.1%). Furthermore, polyparasitism was much more prevalent than monoparasitism (85.3% vs 4.9%). Co-infection with two parasite species (37%) was higher in young horses. In comparison, triplet infection (34%) was higher in adults, and a maximum concurrency of up to six species of parasites at a time was recorded. Following it, the differences in the prevalence rate of parasites based on the predictor of risks, like sex, grazing, domestication type, nature of the floor, and medication practices, were statistically significant. Working horses in the lowlands of Terai harbored a significant variety of intestinal parasites with important prevalence. Since eight of the reported parasitic species were zoonotic, infected horses pose a zoonotic risk to the owners. Therefore, timely deworming, pasture management, and reduction in working pressure are highly recommended. © 2024, National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Radiographic abnormalities are often observed in athletic horses and they can interfere with the performance of racehorses. The origin of changes in sesamoid bones, as well as their evolution or involution during animal growth, remain unknown. The aims of the present study are to radiographically assess proximal sesamoid bones in Thoroughbred horses at suckling and yearling stages, in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil, as well as to investigate the influence of radiographic changes in these bones on animals’ sporting performance. In total, 86 animals were investigated at suckling and yearling stages, in 2012, based on the following radiographic projections: back 15ºproximal-palmarodistal oblique, lateromedial, back 30o medial-palmaro/plantarolateral oblique and back 30o lateral-palmarolateral/plantarolateral oblique. Radiographic changes observed in animals’ sesamoid bones were scored from 0 to 4. The number of races and horses’ performance were classified based on a previously proposed score, by taking into consideration the official results of races held at hippodromes, which were obtained at the end of the study. Healthy horses without bone-related changes were attributed scores 0 and 1, whereas horses presenting bone-related changes were attributed scores 2, 3 and 4. Statistical analysis was based on Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests, at 5% significance level (p < 0.05). Radiographic changes were identified in 3.6% of 688 sesamoid bones analyzed at suckling stage and in 3.7% of bones analyzed at yearling stage. There was significant increase in the number of lateral sesamoid bones with abnormalities in animals’ thoracic and pelvic limbs, from the suckling to the yearling stage. The current findings have evidenced that radiographic changes in proximal sesamoid bones of Thoroughbred racehorses take place at suckling stage and that changes observed at yearling stage did not affect the number of races or animals’ performance. © 2024 Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana.

ABSTRACT: Tarsocrural osteochondrosis (OCD) is a developmental orthopedic disease commonly affecting young Standardbreds, with different fragment localization and size. Clinically, it is characterized by variable synovial effusion in the absence of lameness, whose determinants are ill-defined. We hypothesized that localization and physical characteristics of the osteochondral fragments like dimensions, multifragmentation, and instability influence joint effusion and correlate with synovial markers of cartilage degradation and inflammation. Clinical data, synovial fluid and intact osteochondral fragments were collected from 79 Standardbred horses, aged between 12 and 18 months, operated for tarsocrural OCD. The severity of tarsocrural joint effusion was assessed semi-quantitatively. The osteochondral fragment site was defined radiographically at the distal intermediate ridge of the tibia (DIRT), medial malleolus (MM) of the tibia, and/or lateral trochlear ridge (LTR) of the talus. Size, stability, and arthroscopic appearance (unique or multi-fragmented aspect) of the fragments were determined intra-operatively. Synovial concentrations of C-terminal cross-linked telopeptides of type II collagen (CTX-II), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were quantified. Tarsocrural synovial effusion was significantly affected by localization and stability of the fragments, with MM-located and unstable fragments being associated with highest joint effusion. Concentrations of CTX-II, LTB4, and PGE2 positively correlated with the severity of synovial effusion.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine suspensory ligament branch (branch) ultrasonography is becoming increasingly commonplace presale. No ultrasonographical branch reference data exists for Thoroughbred sales horses. Objectives: To define the prevalence of ultrasonographical findings in the forelimb suspensory branches of yearling and 2-year-old sales Thoroughbreds and to analyse associations with racing performance. To track changes in branch findings between 1 and 2 years of age in horses that present for sale at both ages. Study design: Prospective cohort study using an enrolled sample. Methods: Horses were enrolled from a 2016 yearling sale and five 2017 2-year-old sales with consignor permission. Ultrasonography was performed immediately prior to the sales. Ultrasonographical findings relating to branch size, fibrillar pattern, the presence of hyperechoic foci, periligamentar tissue thickness and the adjacent proximal sesamoid bone surface were examined. Associations with racing performance from 2 to 4 years of age were investigated using multivariate regression analyses. Clinical follow-up was sought to ascertain why horses that did not race never started. Results: A total of 593 sales yearlings and 367 2-year-olds had forelimb branch ultrasonography performed. Grade ≥2 fibrillar branch change was present in 8.9% of yearlings and 14.4% of 2-year-olds. A 0.25 cm increase in branch width was associated with a 49-day delayed start to racing careers (P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 21–77 days). The presence of grade 2 hyperechoic foci was associated with significantly lower total earnings (P = 0.01, 95% CI: $2000–$16 022) and lower earnings per start (P = 0.003, 95% CI: $349–$1718) in United States Dollars. Grade 3 fibrillar branch change had clinically important reductions in the probability of racing, the calibre of racing performance and earnings. Grade 1 fibrillar pattern was associated with significantly higher earnings per start (P = 0.004, 95% CI: $2641–$5759). Main limitations: The findings are applicable to horses prepared for public auction and deemed fit to be entered for sale. The results may underestimate the proportion of severe lesions in horses not entered for sale. Conclusions: Reference values specific to young Thoroughbreds have been established. Grade 1 fibrillar branch change should be regarded as an acceptable appearance in sales yearlings and 2-year-olds. Approximately one-third of grade 2 yearling branches progressed to a grade 3 lesion. Evidence of enlarged branch width and grade 2 hyperechoic foci at 2-year-old sales constitute a risk to racing performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Selle Français (SF) breed originated from native France horses crossed with Thoroughbreds, Arabs, Anglo-Arabs and French Trotters, which allowed for individuals to be obtained with excellent predispositions and a versatile usage for equestrian sports. The performance of the SF horse is widely accepted in the fields of show jumping and eventing; however, they have successfully started to compete in other areas such as dressage, vaulting, carriage driving and TREC competitions. To date, information about the genetic structure of the SF breed has been very limited. In the present report, Sanger sequencing was applied to analyse the whole D-loop of mitochondrial DNA of 98 samples representing Selle Français horses originating from two populations: Algerian (n=47) and French (n=51). The result obtained showed the presence of 19 SNPs, which allowed us to divide the samples into 41 haplotypes (OR909723-OR909773). A higher number of haplotypes was detected in the Algerian population (n=24) compared to the French population (n=14), but both populations did not represent unique clusters and showed a high degree of genetic similarities. The result showed that the identified haplotypes of the SF belonged to four clades: L, A, B and G. The present report gives strong evidence that the Selle Français breed has been established based on a great influence of the Thoroughbred, whose close connection is more visible in the French population. The haplogroup assignment to L clades proved that the SF breed has European origin as ancestral haplogroup L was assigned to West and South Europe while A to West Asia and G and B to Middle East. Our results show SF as an example of a contemporary breed of sport horses with European roots further influenced by local breeds. © Institute of Systematics and Evolution of Animals, PAS, Kraków, 2024

ABSTRACT: Background: Poor noseband adjustment could create high pressures that may risk pain or tissue damage. Objectives: To quantify sub-noseband pressures dorsally over the nasal bone and ventrally over the mandibular rami for a Cavesson, Swedish (crank), Drop and Flash noseband at five tightness levels (2.0 to 0.0 finger equivalents). Study design: In vivo experiments. Methods: Eight high-level dressage horses were ridden at the trot in a straight line by their usual riders. Two small pressure mats, attached to the noseband over the nasal bone and the mandibular rami, collected force (N) and pressure (kPa) data from four noseband types (Cavesson/Swedish/Flash/Drop) each adjusted to five tightness levels (2.0/1.5/1.0/0.5/0.0 finger equivalents) based on the use of a taper gauge. Noseband tightness and types were compared using Friedman's analyses with post hoc Wilcoxon tests (p ≤ 0.01). Results: Pressures (median and [25th and 75th percentiles]) and forces increased with tightness for all noseband types with higher mean pressures consistently recorded on the mandibles (Cavesson: 9.1 [5.0, 12.5] kPa, Swedish: 10.5 [6.3, 14.9] kPa, Flash: 8.0 [3.6, 15.2] kPa) than the nasal bones (Cavesson: 2.8 [1.1, 4.7] kPa, Swedish: 4.3 [3.1, 7.4] kPa, Flash: 4.9 [3.0, 7.3] kPa, p ≤ 0.002). None of the measured nasal pressures or forces differed significantly between tightness levels of 2.0 (1.6 [0.6, 3.6] kPa) and 1.5 fingers (2.9 [1.3, 4.1] kPa), but these values significantly increased from 1.0 (3.1 [1.5, 4.9] kPa), 0.5 (4.2 [2.3, 6.2] kPa), and 0.0 finger tightness (6.4 [3.8, 10.3] kPa) for most variables (p ≤ 0.004). No differences were found in mean/maximal nasal and mandibular pressures when fitted with a Cavesson or Swedish noseband. Main limitations: Behavioural and physiological parameters were not measured. Conclusions: Nasal and mandibular pressures increased with noseband tightness, with 1.0 finger laxity or less associated with significantly and incrementally higher pressures than 1.5 or 2.0 finger tightness. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Ophidic accidents caused by snakes of the genus Bothrops are responsible for 70% of notifications in the country. The antiophidic serum is the specific antidote against envenomation caused by these snakes. Aiming to evaluate the health status of horses producing antibotropic serum, the hematological variables and serum iron were delineated along the protocol of three immunizations. The animals were evaluated at 17 experimental moments, being: control (before the immunogen application), four hours, 24h, 48h, 72h and seven days after inoculations, for each immunization. There was a significant decrease in erythrocyte, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values after the second immunization. Serum iron values showed significant decreases during the three immunizations. Significant decreases in lymphocyte values were noted in the first two immunizations, while there was a significant increase in neutrophil values during all three immunizations. Eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils did not show significant difference throughout the three immunizations. The immunization protocol described in this study caused an inflammatory reaction at the site of immunogen application and transient changes in hematological parameters and iron levels, as by the end of the immunization protocol, the variable values returned the reference levels. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: A native pony, eight years old and male, was tentatively diagnosed with abdominal pain and treated immediately. Sequential hematological profiles revealed increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and creatinine, as well as reduced albumin. After the pony's death, which occurred eight days after treatment began, a necropsy was performed. The liver's external surface showed small foci, but no gross lesion was observed in the pancreas, which was enlarged. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the liver showed multifocal inflammation in the hepatic parenchyma, coinciding with bile duct hyperplasia. The pancreas H&E staining showed well-differentiated tubular glands with normal pancreatic islet morphology. The pancreatic immunohistochemical staining was positive for pan-cytokeratin in the cytoplasm, except in the pancreatic islet cells. It also confirmed negative chymotrypsin staining of the pancreatic tissue, indicating simple and branching ductal structures instead of acinar cells. The pancreas's histopathology was consistent with ductal adenocarcinoma, a condition previously unreported in adult equids. This result suggests that pancreatic tumors should be considered an uncommon differential diagnosis for abdominal pain in adult equids. © 2024 Chulalongkorn University Printing House.

ABSTRACT: In the European Union, energy consumption in agriculture and forestry is less intense than in other economic sectors. However, fossil and non-renewable sources, particularly oil, are predominant, with higher percentages than in different economic sectors. In this context, this study aims to compare the environmental impact generated by equine and mechanical traction for viticulture practices in an organic production context, using life cycle assessment (LCA). Three scenarios were considered: business as usual (i.e., tractor-grown grapes) and horse-grown grapes but with two feeding options (tractor-grown hay and horse-grown hay). The results show that the tractor-grown grape scenario has higher impacts in five impact categories whereas the horse-grown scenario shows higher Global Warming, and to a minor extent Land use. Specifically, the worst results of the control scenario are in the mid-point category of Inorganic Respiratory due to fuel use, which produces P M 2.5. Fuel use is also the cause of the highest environmental burdens in other categories such as terrestrial Ecotoxicity. A sensitive analysis of the results was performed considering the endpoint damage categories. The outcomes show that, in general, the impact of horses is quite stable even under potentially different conditions. Some categories (ecosystem quality, global impact) are only slightly affected by variation in growth time, while all other categories (human health, resources, climate change) experience greater variation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Equine anesthesia is associated with greater patient risk compared to other common domestic species. Delivery of anesthesia is complicated by many factors including the large patient size range, the need to induce controlled recumbency during anesthetic induction, specialized equipment requirements, perfusion issues related to large body mass, and instinctive behaviors. In addition, drug dosages are often extrapolated from those of other species and many of the drugs are used in an extra-label manner. This chapter describes the unique factors associated with anesthesia in horses compared to other species as understanding these is the first step toward improving patient safety. © 2024 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Relevant ophthalmic lesions affecting vision occur in 5%–10% of all horses. Thus, knowledge of anatomy, physiology, clinical and imaging is essential for the discernment of a healthy and a pathological eye. Ultrasonography is an important diagnostic tool for ocular diseases, providing information on lesion site, extension and severity. In addition, it is possible to monitor the treatment efficiency and prognosis. Objectives: This study aimed to provide biometric data about the ocular globe structures of healthy horses in order to establish a normal ultrasonographic pattern. Methods: Ocular globes (n = 40) from 20 healthy horses were evaluated by transpalpebral B-mode ultrasonography, using an 11 MHz linear transducer. Results: The biometrics found in this study were: globe length: 37.78 ± 0.65 mm; anterior chamber: 5.01 ± 0.27 mm; vitreous chamber: 19.19 ± 0.54 mm; lens: 12.82 ± 0.93 mm; cornea: 0.88 ± 0.11 mm. Main limitations: The obtained results can be more safely applied to medium-sized horses (350 ± 43 kg). Conclusions: This study provides normal ocular biometrics that can be used as a reference for the diagnosis of ocular diseases, especially when the lesions are bilateral and nontranslucent cornea hinder internal structures evaluation. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: While domestic horses can be trained to choose the highest numerosity, spontaneous choice tests led to contrasting results, which in part might have depended upon the adopted experimental protocols. To bring further evidence, we carried out two experiments based on binary choice tests (1:4, 1:2, 2:3, 4:6 apple halves). We tested both horses used for schooling (N = 25) and semi-wild bred horses (N = 10), using two different arenas. In both experiments, horses did not choose the highest quantity, irrespective of test difficulty. Horses preferentially chose the stimulus located at their left, while no other tested variable affected their choice. The consistency between the results suggests that the lack of discrimination did not depend on test protocols. The strong preference for a given side and high within-individual repeatability indicate that lateralization may affect the results of spontaneous tests. © ALESSANDRO BALESTRIERI ET AL., 2024.

ABSTRACT: Ethanol, a central nervous system depressant and banned substance in horseracing, has reportedly been administered to horses prior to competition to “calm a horse's nerves.” In this study, the pharmacokinetics of two metabolites of ethanol were studied to better understand the behavior of this compound in the horse and provide a scientific basis for regulation of its administration. Six horses received a single intravenous (30 mL; 1200 mg) and oral (90 mL; 3600 mg) administration of ethanol (vodka, 40% ABV) in a balanced cross-over design. Blood and urine samples were collected at various times post administration for up to 24 h. Concentrations of ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate were determined using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and pharmacokinetic analysis performed. Behavioral, locomotor activity and effects on heart rate were assessed. The maximum concentration (mean ± SD) of ethyl glucuronide was 71.5 ± 42.7 and 105.0 ± 47.5 ng/mL at 0.88 h following IV and oral administration, respectively. The maximum concentrations for the ethyl sulfate metabolite following IV and oral administration were 1.61 ± 0.60 and 3.46 ± 1.68 ng/mL, respectively. Urine concentrations of both metabolites were non-detectable by 24 h post ethyl alcohol administration. No observable behavioral responses were noted following IV or oral administration. Significant decreases in heart rate were noted at various times starting at 10 min until 4 h post administration in the oral dose group. Both ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate could be useful markers for detection of illicit administration of ethanol to horses. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Equine trigeminal-mediated headshaking is a painful neuropathic disorder comparable to trigeminal neuralgia in humans. The selective destruction of pain fibers within the trigeminal ganglion, called rhizotomy, is the surgical treatment of choice for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia refractory to medical treatment in humans. The human trigeminal ganglion is enclosed by a dural recess called the Meckel’s or trigeminal cave, in which the ganglion is surrounded by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled subarachnoid space. During glycerol rhizotomy, glycerol is percutaneously injected in this CSF-filled space. Until now, information about the anatomy of the dural recess and the subarachnoid space surrounding the trigeminal ganglion is lacking in horses. The aim of this study was to explore if a CSF-filled subarachnoid space around the trigeminal ganglion exists in horses. Materials and methods: Six equine cadaver heads were investigated for CSF accumulation around the ganglion with a 3 Tesla MRI. After anatomical dissection to expose the trigeminal root, a polymer-based radiopaque contrast agent was injected through the porus trigeminus into the subarachnoid space (cisternography). The exact delineation and the volume of the contrast agent accumulation were determined on subsequent micro-computed tomographic scans and segmentation. Finally, the distribution of the contrast agent within the subarachnoid space was examined histologically in three specimens. Results: In all 12 specimens included in this study, the trigeminal ganglion was surrounded by a subarachnoid space forming a trigeminal cistern. The mean volume of the trigeminal cave in this study was 0.31 mL (±SD: 0.11 mL). Distribution of the contrast agent along the peripheral nerves (i.e., ophthalmic, maxillary and/or mandibular nerve) was observed in 7 out of 12 specimens. Discussion/conclusion: A subarachnoid space surrounding the trigeminal ganglion exists in the horse and could be targeted for glycerol rhizotomy in horses suffering from trigeminal-mediated headshaking. However, the clinical relevance of contrast agent distribution along the peripheral nerves remains to be assessed.

ABSTRACT: Background: Selective anthelmintic treatment, advocated due to evolving anthelmintic resistance, has been associated with an increase in Strongylus vulgaris prevalence. Reverting to routine interval anthelmintic treatments is not viable and therefore, identifying other management factors correlated with S. vulgaris infection is vital. Objectives: To investigate possible risk factors associated with the presence of S. vulgaris infection in resident horses on Swedish horse establishments. Study design: Internet-based questionnaire survey. Methods: A questionnaire, created using the internet-based survey platform Netigate, was distributed to owners of equine establishments throughout Sweden via established equine platforms and social media channels. The survey was available for response from 21 May until 1 September 2022. Questions were closed ended with branching logic paths. Results: Four factors were significantly associated with S. vulgaris infection, with an increased odds of infection seen in livery yards (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–2.36, p = 0.004) and premises with more than 10 resident horses (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.64–3.56, p < 0.001). A lower odds of infection were seen in establishments using quarantine routines (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.96, p = 0.03) and anthelmintic treatment of new horses prior to arrival at the premise (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18–0.74, p = 0.005). Main limitation: Due to the presence of S. vulgaris infection in the present study being based on S. vulgaris diagnostics performed at the farm level, any association between faecal diagnostic use and risk of infection could not be investigated. Conclusions: Although the use of diagnostics for S. vulgaris can keep infection rates low, large farms or livery yards with many different horse owners, and those with low use of biosecurity measures as regards to new horses arriving at the premise, are associated with a higher risk of infection. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Changes in the proximal sesamoid bones (sesamoids) and the insertional region of the adjacent suspensory ligament branch (branch) are of particular importance in young Thoroughbreds sold at public auction. Little is known about the prevalence of concurrent ultrasonographical branch change, relative to the various grades of radiological sesamoid appearance. Objective: To examine the existence of concurrent radiological and ultrasonographical findings in individual sesamoid-branch units in sales horses; to determine whether there are any radiological findings that are consistently accompanied by a particular degree of insertional branch change, and to provide practical recommendations as to when suspensory branch ultrasonography may be warranted in a sales environment. Study design: Prospective cohort study using an enrolled sample. Methods: Horses were enrolled with consignor permission from a large Thoroughbred yearling sale and five 2-year-old Thoroughbred sales the following year. Data from the radiological evaluation of forelimb sesamoids and the ultrasonographical examination of the adjacent forelimb suspensory branches were described. Results: A total of 2204 yearling forelimb sesamoid-branch units and 1336 2-year-old forelimb sesamoid-branch units were included, from 551 sales yearlings and 334 sales 2-year-olds. The proportion of yearling sesamoids with grade ≤1 vascular channels that had adjacent grade ≥2 fibrillar branch change was 1.2%. The same proportion for 2-year-olds was 3.8%, with medial forelimb sesamoids with grade 1 vascular channels overrepresented in 2-year-olds in this category. In yearlings, 31% of sesamoids with grade 2 vascular channels had adjacent grade ≥2 fibrillar branch change and 59% of sesamoids with grade 3 vascular channels had adjacent grade ≥2 fibrillar branch change. In 2-year-olds, 47% of sesamoids with grade 2 vascular channels had adjacent grade ≥2 fibrillar branch change and 67% of sesamoids with grade 3 vascular channels had the same. Only one yearling sesamoid and one 2-year-old sesamoid with radiological abaxial concavity had grade ≥2 fibrillar branch change. Main limitations: Hindlimbs were not included. Clinical examinations were not performed and the status of any past or present inflammatory process at the sesamoid-branch enthesis could not be inferred from radiographs and ultrasonographic images alone. Conclusions: The existence and prevalence of concurrent radiological and ultrasonographical findings in the proximal sesamoid bones and adjacent suspensory ligament branches in yearling and 2-year-old Thoroughbred sales horses has been established. General recommendations have been made for selective branch ultrasonography on the basis of radiological sesamoid appearance. The results support a separate aetiology for radiological sesamoid abaxial concavity that does not primarily involve the suspensory branch insertion. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Horse Grimace Scale has been shown to be an effective and reliable method of assessing pain from facial images following routine castration in horses. Yet being dependent on a human observer, it is still subject to human bias and subjectivity. This leads to the interest in the development of automated approaches in this domain. In this study we compare two different deep learning approaches to automated pain recognition in horses from lateral facial images using a dataset of n=39 horses undergoing a routine castration. The first method directly classifies from image embeddings and achieves over 73% accuracy in pain recognition. The second method involves regression from embeddings to Facial Action Unit (FAU) scores, surpassing the first with an accuracy exceeding 79%. In terms of accuracy and precision, both methods are comparable and surpass human Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) scoring, with the latter method demonstrating higher recall. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

ABSTRACT: We examined the relationship between inherited motor-related conformation and orientation of facial hair whorls in Japanese Kiso horses. Eleven horses were divided into clockwise, counterclockwise, and radial groups according to facial hair whorls. We placed six markers on anatomical landmarks of each lateral side in a horse and measured the height of the landmarks, the distance between adjacent landmarks, and the angle of the adjacent landmarks. In the counterclockwise group, the horses tended to exhibit higher values on the left side than on the right side, and the comparison of the height of landmarks revealed a significant difference between both sides. Therefore, the orientation of facial hair whorls may suggest the tendency of motor-related conformation, at least in counterclockwise group. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Anesthetizing a horse for colic surgery represents a challenge for the veterinary anesthetist. While the basic principles of equine anesthesia remain, certain complications are more commonly observed in the horse undergoing exploratory laparotomy. The anesthetist should understand the pathophysiology of the condition, and hemodynamic, acid-base, and electrolyte imbalances should be corrected. While the optimal fluid type is still controversial, the chapter will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using isotonic crystalloids versus hypertonic crystalloids or colloids. No standardized anesthetic protocol for horses undergoing colic surgery exists, but providing analgesia is paramount. This chapter will critically review the evidence supporting the use of lidocaine, α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonists, ketamine, and opioids as adjunct agents and will briefly discuss locoregional techniques. Finally, the chapter will cover some features of recovery management relevant to horses that undergo colic surgery. © 2024 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Few studies have investigated the adequate contrast enhancement (CE) evaluation depending on concentration, volume, and rate of administration of contrast media (CM) and the scan parameters in equine contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Objectives: To investigate CE of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) and veins depending on the computed tomography (CT) voltage and concentration, volume, and rate of CM administration during intra-arterial CECT of equine distal forelimbs. Study Design: In vivo experiments. Methods: Six horses underwent 54 CT scans. First, the CE of DDFT and veins was evaluated depending on the voltage (80 kV and 250 mA or 120 kV and 150 mA) and CM concentration (150, 120, or 90 mg I/mL in 50 mL of CM). Second, CE of DDFT and veins was evaluated depending on the CM volume (50, 100, or 150 mL) and administration rate (2, 4, or 6 mL/s) with a fixed iodine delivery rate (IDR; 300 or 180 mg I/s). Results: Contrast enhancement of DDFT was significantly higher at 80 kV of voltage and 150 mg I/mL of CM concentration (Median: 29.65; IQR: 1.74; p < 0.05). CE of the DDFT positively correlated with CM concentration (p < 0.001; r = 0.75). At 180 mg I/s IDR, contrast attenuation in the medial and lateral palmar veins significantly decreased at a CM of 30 mg I/mL, rate of 6 mL/s, and volume of 150 mL (median and IQR: 985.93 and 71.8 Hounsfield units [HU] and 988.73 and 41.16 HU, respectively); the CE was sufficient to distinguish between the vessels and the adjacent structures. Main Limitations: The number of animals was small. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a low CM concentration could yield sufficient CE of the DDFT and arteries with adjusted CT scanning parameters or volume and injection rate of CM. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Plasma or serum amino acids are used to evaluate nutritional status and metabolic disorders. In this study, we aimed to set reference values of serum amino acid concentrations in the Noma horse, a Japanese native horse. Thirty-one horses were classified into six age groups: neonatal foal (0–4 days), foal (0.5–1 years), youth (5 years), middle age (10 years), old (15 years), and extra-old (>20 years). Horses >5 years of age were analyzed together as the adult group. In the adult horses, there were no significant differences among the serum amino acid concentrations of each age group. The foal group had higher concentrations of alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, α-aminoadipic acid, and 3-methyl-histidine than the adult group. The neonatal foal group had higher serum concentrations of phenylalanine, lysine, alanine, proline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, β-alanine, and β-amino-iso-butyric acid and lower tryptophan concentrations and Fischer’s ratios than the adult group. The neonatal foal group had higher β-amino-iso-butyric acid concentrations and lower tryptophan and 3-methyl-histidine concentrations than the foal group. Therefore, reference values might be set separately in neonatal foals, foals, and adult horses. The data for the serum amino acid concentrations can be used for health care through physiological and pathological evaluations in Noma horses. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: Endurance and flat race are entirely different efforts and thus require completely different organism adaptations to achieve the performance. This study aimed to examine the difference in basal lipid metabolism in Arabian horses undergoing different training regimens for endurance and race and possible gender differences. The study enrolled sixty male and female’ Arabian horses; thirty were trained for race, and thirty were trained for 80 km endurance races. The analyses included body condition score, body weight, body mass index, % body fat, and blood collected to determine triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density proteins, high-density proteins, and non-esterified fatty acids. Ultrasonography was used to measure the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer in the longissimus dorsi muscle, as well as the thickness of the rump fat and the cross-section of the gluteus medius muscle. This study showed that lipid profile is more influenced by type of exercise than by gender, being more efficient on endurance horses. © (Publication Year), (publisher Name). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Various factors have a distinct impact on the quantity and dimensions of red blood cells across diverse animal species. These factors encompass age, sex, elevation, time of year, and lineage. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of breed on the morphometric parameters of red blood cells in horses. To examine the impact of various horse breeds on the diameter, circumference, and surface area of red blood cells, blood samples were obtained from a total of 90 healthy horses. These horses belonged to three different breeds, including Arab Thoroughbred, English Thoroughbred, and Barbe. Each breed consisted of 30 individuals, with an equal distribution of males and females. The collected blood specimens were then divided into two separate batches for further analysis. The age range of all horses included in the study was between 5 and 12 years old. Smears were made and stained using the May-Grünwald Giemsa technique. The morphometric measurements were performed while using the OPTIKATM Vision Pro special software. The obtained results showed that there were no significant differences in the red blood cell diameters across different horse breeds. However, this factor appears to influence significantly both the circumference and surface area of erythrocytes. Specifically, the circumference and surface of Barbe red blood cells were highly smaller than both Arabian and English purebred horses. The present study demonstrated that the circumference and surface of red blood cells appear to be more indicative and representative in detecting variations in the erythrocyte morphometry between different horse breeds.

ABSTRACT: Laminitis is a serious health condition that can cause severe pain and lameness in horses. Due to lack of understanding of laminitis, treatments often fail to achieve the desired results. In recent years, we have begun to recognize that laminitis may involve a complex interaction between local and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been linked in the development of systemic inflammation, and our previous findings suggest that the development of laminitis is closely linked to the production of harmful metabolites of the gut microbiota. In addition, it was found that localized lesions in the hoof, especially lamellar injuries, are the most direct cause of laminitis. Matrix metalloproteinases have been found to be strongly associated with the development of laminitis. Recent discovery has found that methylated tirilazad has a role in repairing laminar tissue in vitro. However, its efficacy in horses never has been studied. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of methylated tirilazad (product name: PTP-102) in the prevention/treatment of oligofructose-induced laminitis. The results showed that oligofructose successfully induced laminitis in horses, resulting in detreated clinical signs. Blood indices (including inflammation-related indices and other related indices) were significantly increased. Observations of dissection and staining showed significant bleeding, swelling, and damage to hoof tissue. Analysis of the gut microbiota showed a significant decrease in abundance and diversity, and a significant increase in the relative abundance of specific bacteria. Following methylated tirilazad intervention, there were a significant improvement in clinical signs, blood markers and lamellar tissue damage. Additionally, methylated tirilazad positively influenced the gut microbiota structure by reducing the relative abundance of genera closely associated with the development of equine laminitis. This suggests that some of the therapeutic mechanism of methylated tirilazad may be linked to its effects on the gut microbiota. Notably, methylated tirilazad had better effect in the treatment group than the prophylactic group, indicating the post-diagnosis utility of methylated tirilazad for laminitis management.

ABSTRACT: Background: Colic, a primary cause of illness and death in horses, necessitates the development of improved prognostic tools. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of physiological and biochemical parameters in horses suffering from colic. Methods: A comprehensive clinical evaluation of 117 horses included assessment of heart rate, mucous membranes, capillary refill time, rectal temperature, respiratory rate, gut motility, reflux, and limb pulse strength. Results: Stomach reflux, absence of gut noises, and increased heart rate (mean increase of 12 bpm) strongly correlate with a poor prognosis. Prolonged capillary refill time (mean increase of 3 seconds), rectal temperature (over 38.5°C), elevated packed cell volume (mean increase of 4%), and blood lactate levels (mean increase of 5 mmol/l) underscore the significance of these markers. Notably, blood lactate (p < 0.001), gut noises (p < 0.05), and heart rate (p < 0.001) demonstrate the highest predictive significance based on statistical analysis. Conclusion: Future research should investigate the prognostic potential of additional parameters and assess the impact of recommended treatments on colic prognosis. This data-driven study emphasizes the critical role of early recognition and thorough assessment in colic cases, offering vital insights into improving equine healthcare and mitigating mortality rates. © 2024, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive biotechniques in the equine species have advanced in the last decade and horse breeders have started to question the possibilities of interfering in the determination of foal sex. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the variables mares and stallion’s age, side of the ovary containing the preovulatory follicle, preovulatory follicle diameter, time between breeding and ovulation, and ovulation inducing hormones influence the sex of the foal. A total of 259 reproductive cycles of 160 mares and 22 Thoroughbred stallions were used. Statistical analysis was performed using R software, including Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression. Of the total foals born, 136 were males (52.51%) and 123 were females (47.49%). In mares that ovulated with -24h after ovulation induction, 104 foals (54.74%) were males and 86 (45.26%) were females, while in mares that ovulated with +24h, 32 foals (46.38%) were males and 37 (53.62%) were females. Stallions up to 15 years old had 44.14% (n=49) females and those over 15 years had 49.66% (n=73) females. The simple logistic regression model showed that mares and stallions under 15 years old, mares with ovulation time less than 24 hours and treated with Deslorelin had a higher probability of having male foals, but the Pearson's chi-square test showed that foals gender were not influenced by the variables studied. © The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Cervical articular process joint (CAPJ) therapy is advocated for horses with neck disorders. Several ultrasound-guided CAPJ techniques have been described in cadaver studies with 72%–89% intra-articular injection accuracy; however, the CAPJ injection accuracy in clinical equine practice has not been extensively reported. Objectives: To describe a modified cranial approach for ultrasound-guided caudal CAPJ injections, to investigate the accuracy of this CAPJ injection technique in live horses, and to assess the effect of CAPJ injection location, laterality, operator, and radiographic CAPJ enlargement on injection accuracy. Study design: Retrospective case study. Methods: Medical records of adult horses in which ultrasound-guided caudal (C4–T1) CAPJ injections were performed using a modified cranial approach between November 2006 and December 2020 were reviewed. Radiographic images of caudal cervical vertebrae were assessed by a blinded radiologist and the degree of CAPJ enlargement was graded using a previously described grading system (Rgrade 1-5b). Ultrasound-guided caudal CAPJ injection accuracy was determined by synovial fluid retrieval during an individual CAPJ injection. Statistical analysis was performed using mixed-effects multivariable logistic model to evaluate the association of CAPJ injection accuracy and the CAPJ injection location, Rgrade, laterality (right, left), and operator. Results: The study included 149 horses with 177 hospital admissions. Synovial fluid was obtained from 586/658 (89.1%) caudal CAPJs using modified cranial ultrasound-guided approach for CAPJ injections. C6–C7 CAPJ injections had 7-fold higher likelihood (OR = 6.78, 95% CI: 1.67–27.52; p = 0.007) of synovial fluid retrieval compared with C4–C5 CAPJ injections. Operator, CAPJ injection side (left, right), and degree of radiographic CAPJ enlargement did not have significant effects on the success of synovial fluid retrieval from ultrasound-guided caudal CAPJ injections. Main limitations: Retrospective study design. Conclusions: Intra-articular ultrasound-guided caudal CAPJ injections using a modified cranial approach can be performed accurately in live horses with and without CAPJ arthropathy. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness (AHS) is a viral disease transmitted by arthropods that impacts Equidae, specifically horses and related species. Recognized as a notifiable disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), AHS is associated with a high mortality rate of 80%-90% in susceptible hosts and exhibits rapid transmission dynamics. Historical records document numerous instances of mass horse deaths attributed to AHS, with recent occurrences in Thailand and Malaysia in 2020 causing heightened concerns within the local horse industry. The lack of a comprehensive global perspective on the distribution and transmission of AHS poses challenges in comprehending and implementing effective prevention and control strategies. This study marks a pioneering effort in analyzing the global epidemiological patterns of AHS across different regions. By employing predictive modeling with a comprehensive set of environmental variables, we uncovered overarching global patterns in AHS dynamics, a first in this field. Our analysis revealed significant regional differences influenced by specific climatic conditions, highlighting the disease's complexity. The study also identifies new high-risk areas for AHS, underscoring the necessity for regionally tailored disease management strategies. Despite some limitations, such as the exclusion of wild equine data, this research offers critical insights for global AHS intervention and prevention, setting a path for future research incorporating broader datasets and socioeconomic factors.  © 2024 KwangHyok Kim et al.

ABSTRACT: Context. A challenge in grassland conservation is to maintain both the openness and the heterogeneity of the habitat to support the diversity of their animal communities, including birds—a taxon that is known to be sensitive to disturbance. An increasingly used management tool in European grassland conservation, especially in rewilding projects, is grazing by large herbivores such as horses and cattle. These grazers are believed to create and maintain patchy landscapes that promote diversity and richness of other species, but their influence on birds is often debated by conservationists, who raise concerns about the impact of disturbance by the grazers. Objectives. Our aim was to examine the relationship between the abundance and species richness of birds across four foraging guilds and the area utilization patterns of Highland cattle and Konik horses in an alluvial grassland in France. We also aimed to examine the influence of land cover and season on the spatial distribution, including abundance and species richness, of different bird guilds present in the grazed area. Methods. We used GPS-collars on all grazers and recorded their positions on an hourly basis over a study period of 1.5 years, assessing patterns of area usage. We counted birds weekly along three transects to describe their distribution within the grazed area and carried out land-cover surveys to describe the habitat. To assess how species richness and abundance of birds of different guilds were related to grazer density, season, and habitat characteristics, we used GAMM models in a spatially explicit framework. We also compared bird numbers at our main study site with a nearby non-grazed control area. Results. The number of birds in the grazed area was about twice the number in the non-grazed control area. Within the grazed area, the abundance of open-area foraging birds increased with increasing grazer density. The number of woodland-foraging birds was also positively correlated with grazer density but less so than open-area foraging birds. The number of individuals in the aerial and wetland bird guilds was not correlated with the density of grazers. Most bird species and individuals were observed on open landscapes scattered with woody patches and waterbodies, and on areas with moderate grazer density. Conclusions. Low-intensity grazing represents a potentially important management tool in creating heterogeneity in alluvial grasslands, thereby promoting suitable habitat for a diverse assemblage of bird species.

ABSTRACT: Sleep plays a crucial role for animal welfare due to its significant biological function of restorative properties. To achieve paradoxical sleep, horses need to lie down, therefore lying has been reported as an effective animal-based indicator. Accelerometer devices are commonly used in cattle to continuously monitor lying behavior. The aim of this study was to understand whether accelerometers attached to the leg can be a reliable device to accurately monitor horse lying behavior. As a pilot, three horses were equipped with a MSR145 Data Logger to monitor the daily duration of lying behaviour, as well as the length and frequency of lying bouts over a period of 5 consecutive days. The accelerometer was positioned within the stable boot on the left front limb of the horses when they were housed in single boxes. The data were extracted, checked for the positioning of the sensor and the data variability, and then analyzed in continuous using the raw data time series. The accelerometer was always mounted correctly and there was a modest data variability on the daily lying time. Mean lying time over 24 hours was 171 minutes with 3 to 5 lying bouts of mean duration of 30 minutes each. Horses showed an individual lying down pattern that was similar over the 5 days. Our preliminary results showed that the accelerometer can be a reliable, useful, and well accepted tool to monitor lying behavior of horses kept in single box. These preliminary results open the possibility to further investigation regarding horse athlete sleep patterns, especially during traveling for competitions. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

ABSTRACT: Objective: The aim of this study was to detect and describe ocular abnormalities in a population of Turkmen horses. Animals Studied: A total of 55 Turkmen horses (33 mares and 22 stallions) from one herd were evaluated in this study. Procedure(s): Demographic data (Age, Sex, Coat color) were recorded. All animals underwent complete ophthalmic examination. The Schirmer tear test -I (STT-I) was performed for all horses prior to other diagnostic tests. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations (menace response, dazzle reflex, pupillary light reflex, maze test, and visual tracking) were carried out in different lighting situations (bright and dim lights). Slit lamp biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein staining, and tonometry were performed for each horse. Results: The mean (standard deviation) age of horses was 5.7 (4.6) years (range of 1–17 years). In total, 18 horses (32.7%) had ocular-related lesions. Cataract, iris hyperpigmentation and corneal edema were the most identified conditions in the horses of this study. Conclusions: About one-third of studied horses had at least one ocular abnormality. No ocular abnormalities attributed to the distinct cream/gold coat color were identified, which the Turkmen horse is known for. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: The intussusception of the large intestine in adult horses has been poorly reported. The aim of this study is to report a case of an acute abdomen due to cecocolic intussusception in a Brazilian Sport Horse mare, aged eight, after the administration of imidocarb dipropionate. The drug used for the treatment of piroplasmosis caused a state of dysmotility in the large intestine and subsequent abdominal discomfort. Surgical intervention was necessary, performed through a median celiotomy, opting for partial typhlectomy due to tissue and circulatory compromise. The postoperative evolution was satisfactory and without serious complications, with a good short- and long-term prognosis, as the patient continued to perform its athletic functions. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe a combined treatment approach for heterochromic iridocyclitis and secondary keratitis (HIK) in horses. Animal Studied: A total of 15 horses (16 eyes). Procedures: Sixteen eyes from 15 horses (mean age 14.1 years, range 6–26 years) received low-dose (4 mg) intravitreal preservative-free gentamicin injection (IVGI) and modified Gundersen grafts with standing sedation and local anesthesia following a clinical diagnosis of HIK. Additional therapies of suprachoroidal triamcinolone (8 mg) injection, episcleral bromfenac implants, and suprachoroidal cyclosporine implants were performed in individual cases. Leptospira titers were also reported when available. Results: The most frequent ophthalmic findings were pigmented keratic precipitates (n = 15/16 eyes, 94%), corneal edema (n = 14/16 eyes, 88%), and pigmented cells suspended in the anterior chamber (n = 7/16 eyes, 44%). Postoperative treatment generally consisted of topical and systemic NSAIDs, topical antibiotics, and a topical mydriatic agent. Complications included persistent corneal edema (7/16, 44%), corneal ulceration (6/16, 38%), graft failure requiring revision (2/16, 13%), stromal abscess (1/16, 6%), surgery site infection (1/16, 6%), and suspected retinal degeneration following IVGI (1/16, 6%). One case was enucleated 6 months after treatment (1/16, 6%). Of the 12 eyes with at least 3 months of post-treatment follow-up, 10 were comfortable and visual with static or improved symptoms of HIK. Conclusions: This multimodal treatment approach aims to address both the anterior uveitis and endothelial decompensation frequently seen in horses with HIK. The surgery can be performed under standing sedation. Continued evaluation and long-term follow-up is necessary in all horses with HIK. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: The composition and structure of gut microbiota are easily influenced by external factors, especially host genetics. While horses are closely related to human life, there is a lack of research comparing the gut microbiota compositions and differences between native Mongolian horse (MH) and imported Dutch Warmblood horse (DH). Here, we collected feces from MH and DH and compared the differences in gut microbiota between the two breeds of horses using amplicon sequencing. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the diversity of gut microbiota between the two breeds of horses. At the phylum level, both Firmicutes and Bacteroidota were the most dominant phyla in all samples, independent of species. In addition, we also observed significant differences in 78 bacterial genera between the MH and DH, of which 36 genera (Bifidobacterium, Chujaibacter, Lactobacillus, Rothia, etc.) were significantly increased in DH and 42 genera (Aequorivita, Aeromicrobium, Psychrobacillus, Brevibacterium, etc.) were significantly decreased compared with MH. Altogether, this investigation dissected the compositions and differences of the gut microbiota between DH and MH and observed distinct differences in the gut microbiota between the two breeds of horses. Furthermore, these findings enhance our comprehension of the gut microbiome features of distinct horse breeds, which helps to analyze the differences in traits among different horses. © 2024 University of Agriculture.

ABSTRACT: Diabetic ketoalkalosis (DKALK) is a rare but significant variant of diabetic emergencies, characterized by metabolic alkalosis rather than the typical acidosis seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite its clinical importance, DKALK often goes unrecognized due to limited literature on its presentation and biochemical variables. This work examines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, management strategies, and implications for clinical practice of DKALK, drawing insights from case studies and research gaps in the field. Notable case studies underscore the diagnostic challenges and emphasize the importance of tailored management strategies for DKALK. Risk assessment involves recognizing predisposing factors such as severe vomiting, alcohol abuse, or concomitant diuretic use. Timely recognition and intervention are essential to prevent potentially life-threatening complications associated with DKALK. Continued research efforts are warranted to refine diagnostic criteria, optimize therapeutic approaches, and enhance early recognition of DKALK, ultimately improving patient outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Information on health care and health status of U.S. senior horses (≥15 years of age) is currently sparse. Objectives: (A) Provide an overview of owner-reported (1) medical conditions, (2) management/treatment practices for equine metabolic syndrome and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), (3) frequencies of routine health care practices and (4) supplement and pharmaceutical use in U.S. senior horses (≥15 years of age). (B) Evaluate potential risk factors for certain medical conditions and for low routine health care. Study design: Online survey. Methods: Descriptive and inferential analysis (binomial logistic regression and ANOVA) of 2717 questionnaires from owners of U.S. senior horses. Results: The most common owner-reported veterinary-diagnosed medical conditions were osteoarthritis (30%), dental disorders (15%), lameness (14%), PPID (12%) and ocular disorders (6%). Advancing age was found to be a risk factor for PPID (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.14 [1.10–1.18]), dental (OR [95% CI] = 1.18 [1.15–1.22]) and ocular (OR [95% CI] = 1.05 [1.01–1.10]) disorders. Only 36% of horses were free of owner-reported veterinary-diagnosed medical conditions at the time of the survey. During the year prior to the survey, most routine healthcare practices (i.e., veterinary health care, dental care and anthelmintic treatment) were typically undertaken one to two times per year, while farrier visits occurred mostly every 5–6 weeks. Retired senior horses had a higher risk of no health care visits (OR [95% CI] = 2.1 [1.38–3.06]), no dental care (OR [95% CI] = 2.0 [1.31–3.00]) and low farrier attendance (i.e., ≤4 times/year) (OR [95% CI] = 2.4 [1.57–3.63]) compared with senior horses used for pleasure riding. The most frequently administered drug was firocoxib (18%) and joint supplements were the most provided supplements (41%). Main limitations: Potential recall, response and sampling bias. Risk factor analyses do not establish causal relationships. Conclusions: Medical conditions are highly prevalent in U.S. senior horses. Retired senior horses have an increased risk of low routine health care. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: The diagnosis of mild–moderate equine asthma (MEA) can be confirmed by airway endoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) cytology, and lung function evaluation by indirect pleural pressure measurement. Oscillometry is a promising pulmonary function test method, but its ability to detect subclinical airway obstruction has been questioned. Objectives: To evaluate the differences in lung function measured by oscillometry between healthy and MEA-affected horses. Study design: Prospective case–control clinical study. Methods: Thirty-seven horses were divided into healthy and MEA groups, based on history and clinical score; the diagnosis of MEA was confirmed by airway endoscopy and BALf cytology. Horses underwent oscillometry at frequencies ranging from 2 to 6 Hz. Obtained parameters included whole-breath, inspiratory, expiratory, and the difference between inspiratory and expiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs). Differences between oscillometry parameters at different frequencies were evaluated within and between groups by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA and post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction. Frequency dependence was compared between groups by t test. For significant parameters, a receiver operating characteristics curve was designed, cut-off values were identified and their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: No significant differences in Xrs and Rrs were observed between groups. The frequency dependence of whole-breath and inspiratory Xrs significantly differed between healthy (respectively, −0.03 ± 0.02 and −0.05 ± 0.02 cmH2O/L/s) and MEA (−0.1 ± 0.03 and −0.2 ± 0.02 cmH2O/L/s) groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). For inspiratory Xrs frequency dependence, a cut-off value of −0.06 cmH2O/L/s was identified, with 86.4% (95% CI: 66.7%–95.3%) sensitivity and 66.7% (95% CI: 41.7%–84.8%) specificity. Main limitations: Sample size, no BALf cytology in some healthy horses. Conclusions: Oscillometry can represent a useful non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of MEA. Specifically, the evaluation of the frequency dependence of Xrs may be of special interest. © 2024 The Author(s). Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Three bacteria extensively acknowledged as venereal pathogens with the potential to induce endometritis include Taylorella equigenitalis, the causative agent of contagious equine metritis (CEM), specific strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain capsule types of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The United Kingdom's Horserace Betting Levy Board recommends pre-breeding screening for these bacteria in their International Codes of Practice and >20 000 samples are tested per annum in the United Kingdom alone. While the pathogenesis and regulatory importance of CEM are well established, an evaluation of the literature pertaining to venereal transmission of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae was lacking. The aim of this review was to evaluate published literature and determine the significance of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae as venereal pathogens in horses. Literature definitively demonstrating venereal transmission was not available. Instead, application of molecular typing methods suggested that common environmental sources of contamination, such as water, or fomites be considered as modes of transmission. The presence of organisms with pathogenic potential on a horse's external genitalia did not predict venereal transmission with resultant endometritis and reduced fertility. These findings may prompt further investigation using molecular technologies to confirm or exclude venereal spread and investigation of alternative mechanisms of transmission are indicated. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Morphine is an effective analgesic in horses, however, IV administration at therapeutic doses has been shown to produce dose-dependent neuroexcitation and unwanted gastrointestinal effects. The analgesic effects of morphine have, at least in part, been attributed to the morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) metabolite. Oral administration to horses results in comparable M6G concentrations to that achieved following IV administration of a therapeutic dose without the adverse effects. The anti-nociceptive effects have not yet been reported. In the current study the thermal anti-nociceptive effects of single and multiple oral doses of morphine were assessed. Methods: Six horses received a single 0.2 mg/kg IV dose of morphine and multiple oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg morphine every 12 h for 4.5 days. Blood samples were collected throughout administration, morphine, and metabolite concentrations determined and pharmacokinetic analysis performed. Drug related behavior and physiologic responses were recorded. Response to noxious stimuli was evaluated by determining thermal threshold latency in response to the application of heat. Results: The maximum concentrations of M6G were higher following oral administration compared to IV and the combined morphine and M6G concentrations exceeded that of IV administration starting at 2 h. Oral administration of 0.8 mg/kg morphine provided and maintained comparable anti-nociception effects to IV morphine with less adverse effects, following single and multiple doses. Morphine was well tolerated following oral administration with less excitation and minimal effects on gastrointestinal borborygmi scores compared to IV administration. Discussion: Results of the current study warrant further investigation of the anti-nociceptive effects of oral morphine administration to horses.

ABSTRACT: Strangles is a globally widespread, commonly diagnosed and important infectious disease of equids caused by Streptococcus equi subsp. equi. We performed whole genome sequencing of 19 S. equi isolates collected from imported horses at the Japanese border. Of these isolates, 15 isolates were obtained from clinical cases and 4 were from subclinical cases. The 19 isolates were grouped into 3 Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS) groups by the core genome single nucleotide polymorphism analysis corresponding to exporting country, SeM typing, or exporter of the horses. The 19 isolates possessed same pathogenic genes regardless of clinical status in imported horses and no antimicrobial resistance genes. The disease status of the horses may rather reflect the prior exposure of animals with sub-clinical infection to S. equi. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Background: Wound infusion catheters (WICs) have been used in humans and some veterinary species for post-operative local anesthetic administration following a variety of surgical procedures, aiming to reduce post-operative analgesia requirements and improve patient comfort. Benefit in reduction in pain, post-operative analgesia requirements and length of hospital stay are well documented in humans, but use of WICs may not have been widely adopted in veterinary species due to the concern of increased complications, such as dehiscence or surgical site infection (SSI), creating a barrier to their use. This study aimed to evaluate the use of WICs in horses undergoing standing partial ostectomy surgeries, document complications and investigate if the incidence of SSI was equivalent between those horses that did and did not have a WIC. Methods: Clinical records were searched between January 2010–December 2023 for horses undergoing standing partial ostectomy surgery of thoracolumbar vertebral spinous processes at one institution. Population variables (age, breed, bodyweight), placement of a WIC or not, post-operative complications, analgesia protocols and surgical time were recorded. Horses received up to 0.1 mg kg−1 bupivacaine (0.5 mg mL−1) every 6–8 h via the WIC where one was placed. To compare SSI complication incidence between using or not using a WIC, a proportional independent equivalence test was used. Results: There were 64 horses included in the final analysis with a WIC placed in 29/64 horses (45.3%) and 35/64 (54.7%) having no WIC placed at surgery. Incidence of short-term SSI was 11.4% (no WIC used) and 13.8% (WIC used), respectively. The difference in proportion of SSI between the presence or absence of a WIC was not significant [−0.024 (90% CI −0.181; 0.133); p = 0.94]. Conclusion: The incidence of SSIs was equivalent between groups whether a WIC was used or not. WICs should be considered as part of a multi-modal analgesic approach in the post-operative period. Further research into local anesthetic dosing and its impact on rescue analgesia requirements and pain-scores is warranted. Copyright © 2024 Wickstead, Milner and Bardell.

ABSTRACT: Due to the difficulty in acessing certain sites of fermentation and possible starch digestion, studies show the need for equine gastric digestive fisiology evaluation. The aim of this experiment was to assess horses supplemented with live yeast and protected live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae NCYC Sc 47) to validate a new procedure of gastric content collection for determination of pH, latic acid, short chain fatty acids and gas production and degradation to be used in further in vitro fermentative studies. The experimental design used was a the latin square (4x4) for 4 periods and 1 day of gastric content collection, with 15 days of rest between it. The groups were divided in control (CTRL), non protected live yeast (NPYEA), protected live yeast (PYEA) and a combination of live yeast + protected yeast (COMB). Treatment means were compared using orthogonal contrasts (C1: CTRL versus NPYEA, PYEA and COMB; C2: COMB versus NPYEA and PYEA; C3: NPYEA versus PYEA) and Tukey's test was used at a 5% significance level. The procedure was highly tolerated and provided great accuracy of the collection site. The live yeast supplementation increased the concentration of acetic acid at the horses’ stomachs. When gastric content was used as inoculum for in vitro fermentation, the protected live yeast produced less gas. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais). All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Reaching a specific diagnosis in horses with chronic or recurrent abdominal pain may be challenging and elusive. Objectives: The aim of this study was to report indications, findings and outcomes of equine exploratory laparoscopy in a case series to support its diagnostic value and identify potential limitations. Study design: Retrospective cases series. Methods: Sixty-nine client-owned horses underwent laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen due to chronic colic symptoms. All horses were operated standing while sedated and under local anaesthesia. Diagnosis, follow-up, surgical or medical interventions, as well as intra- and postoperative complications were recorded. Results: A definitive diagnosis could be made by laparoscopy in 61 horses. However, no abnormal findings were found by laparoscopic exploration of the abdominal cavity in eight horses. Overall, the sensitivity of diagnostic laparoscopy in the standing horse in our study was 88% and its specificity was 15%. No severe intra- or postoperative complications occurred. Exploratory flank laparoscopy in the standing horse can be a valuable diagnostic tool for chronic abdominal pain. Main limitations: The limitations of the present study are its retrospective nature, missing some details in the reports. In addition, no long-term follow-up was available for the horses which underwent surgical intervention, and whether the colic signs reoccurred after a period of time or complications occurred in the long-term postoperative period are not known. No confirmation of the laparoscopic diagnosis was available in some horses, and a post-mortem examination or histology of a biopsy sample would have been beneficial. Conclusions: Exploratory flank laparoscopy in the standing horse can be considered in horses with chronic abdominal pain in view of the high sensitivity and low complication rate of this study. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent condition in horses, leading to changes in trabecular bone structure and radiographic texture. Although fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity have been applied to quantify these changes in humans, their application in horses remains nascent. This study evaluated the use of FD, bone area fraction (BA/TA), and lacunarity in quantifying trabecular bone differences in the proximal phalanx (P1) in 50 radiographic examinations of equine metacarpophalangeal joints with varying OA degrees. In the dorsopalmar view, regions of interest were defined in the trabecular bone of the proximal epiphysis, medial and lateral to the sagittal groove of P1. Lower BA/TA values were observed medially in horses with severe OA (P=0.003). No significant differences in FD and lacunarity were found across OA degrees (P>0.1). FD, BA/TA, and lacunarity were not effective in identifying radiographic texture changes in the P1 trabecular bone in horses with different metacarpophalangeal OA degrees. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: Due to a lack of research on parasite infections in horses in Iraq, the aims of the current investigate is to assess the clinical manifestations linked with ascariasis in infected horses. Additionally, it seeks to assess the prevalence of ascariasis in horses in Al Muthanna province and evaluate the impact of various risk factors on the infection rate such as age, sex, and seasonality. Moreover, the PCR was used to confirm the presence of P. equorum in the horses. This study was conducted on 138 samples of horse feces, which gathered from various locations within the Al-Muthanna province during the period extended from January 2022 and the end of October 2022. The most typical clinical indications of ascariasis infection in horses were diarrhea 51.4%, increased heart rate 50.27%, respiratory rate 46.37%, coughing 50%, snoring during breathing 48.55%, nasal and ocular discharge 49.27%, and rough hair coat 52.89%. Also, results of epidemiological investigation discovered that out of 138 examined horses, 75 tested positives for ascariasis, with infection rate of 54.34% depended to flotation technique. A correlation was observed between climatic conditions and the occurrence of ascariasis, with the highest infection rates occurring in winter (73.1%) and the lowest in summer (26.6%). Regarding gender, infection rates were 66.6% for females and 45.67% for males. In contrast, the age group of <3 years had the highest infection rate at 72.41%. While, the infection rate had been lowest (32.75%) in the age group of >6 years (Old). On the other hand, PCR findings indicated that 36 (72%) out of 50 horses were positive to p. equorum in PCR.The current study concluded that PCR demonstrated higher specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing ascariasis in horses compared to the flotation technique. Additionally, the study found that, although ascariasis occurs throughout the year, it is most prevalent in winter. The survey also showed that males and horses older than 6 years are less susceptible to ascariasis. © 2024, ResearchersLinks Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Autologous protein solution (APS) has been shown to decrease lameness in horses with osteoarthritis (OA). Synovitis is an early driver of OA, providing an opportunity to intervene in the progression of disease via intra-articular (IA) therapeutics. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a single IA APS injection in horses with interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced synovitis. We hypothesised that APS would decrease joint swelling and lameness, improve synovial fluid parameters and improve joint pathology scores in horses compared with untreated controls. Study design: Randomised controlled in vivo experiment. Methods: Synovitis was induced with IL-1β (65 ng) in one randomly selected tarsocrural joint. Twenty-four hours later, joints were treated with APS (Pro-Stride®) (n = 12) or left as untreated controls (n = 6). Lameness examinations and joint circumference measurements were performed on Days 0 (prior to IL-1β), 1 (prior to APS), 2, 4, 7 and 14. Synovial fluid, obtained on the same days, was analysed for protein concentration, nucleated cell count, and cytokine (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations. Gross pathology and synovial membrane histopathology scoring was performed on APS-treated (n = 5), untreated control (n = 4) and normal (n = 9) tarsocrural joints. Results: APS did not decrease lameness or joint circumference compared with untreated controls. Synovial fluid parameters were not different between treatment groups. APS treatment did significantly decrease gross and histopathology scores. Main limitations: Main limitations included the use of an induced model of the synovitis, inter-horse variability in the response to IL-1β and likely variability in the constituents of APS from individual horses. Conclusions: APS treatment of tarsocrural joints with synovitis did not significantly improve lameness or alter synovial fluid parameters. APS did lead to significant improvement in gross joint appearance and synovial membrane histology suggesting that APS may have disease-modifying effects. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Hemangiosarcoma is a rare neoplasia in horses, with a reported prevalence of 0% to 0.7% and literature reports are few. Here we report a case of cutaneous hemangiosarcoma on the palmaromedial aspect of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the right thoracic limb of a 28-year old mixed breed mare. Macroscopically, the lesion was ulcerated and hemorrhagic, with significant involvement of the surrounding tissues resulting in acquired flexural deformity of the metacarpophalangeal joint and grade 4/5 lameness (AAEP). The diagnosis was confirmed histologically. Surgical ablation was not possible and, in view of the involvement of surrounding tissues and the age of the patient, the lesion was treated conservatively. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are extensively used in veterinary practice. COX-2 inhibitors are considered to be safer than non-selective inhibitors; however, there are few studies address of their long-term use in equine species. The goal of this study was to identify the possible adverse effects of meloxicam (a preferential COX-2 inhibitor) in healthy horses, administered at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg, orally, once a day, for 28 days. A paired test was performed with seven animals, and the clinical, hematological, biochemical, and gastroscopic parameters, as well as bleeding time, were evaluated in five timepoints and an electrocardiogram at three timepoints. No relevant adverse effects were observed in terms of the parameters evaluated. Significant differences were found in heart rate, AST and P wave duration, segmented neutrophils (%), and the levels of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCH, compared with these parameters at T0; however, no animal manifested clinical alterations. Gastroscopy revealed discrete lesions (Grade 1) in the squamous gastric mucosa on day 14 of treatment in all animals; however, at the end of the study (day 28) these lesions had regressed to grade 0 in three of the horses and remained at grade 1 in the other four animals. Based on these results, we conclude that the use of meloxicam at a daily dose of 0.6 mg/kg, orally, for 28 consecutive days, did not cause relevant adverse effects in healthy horses. © 2024 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

ABSTRACT: Proper training improves the horse’s performance. In the present study, blood transcriptome of the Yili horse was analysed before and after training. Overall, six Yili horses were trained for 3 months; blood samples at rest were collected before and after the training period. Transcriptome libraries were created from the blood samples using high-throughput sequencing; Gene Ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed for differentially expressed genes to identify the pathways and candidate genes associated with training and locomotor performance. In total, transcriptome analysis screened 33 significantly differentially expressed genes; of these, 23 and 10 were up-regulated and down-regulated after training, respectively. These differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways associated with exercise physiology, including sphingolipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and the cGMP-PKG signalling pathway. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying locomotor performance of the Yili horse as well as a novel insight into the kinematics of this breed. © 2024, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is limited literature regarding equine immune mediated keratitis (IMMK) in Europe. North America-based publications describe minimal blepharospasm, rare corneal ulceration and no uveitis; clinical impression suggests these are seen in Europe. Objectives: Assess the prevalence of blepharospasm, corneal ulceration and uveitis and their impact on outcome in horses diagnosed with IMMK in Europe (UK and Finland). Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Clinical records of 94 horses with IMMK were evaluated. The UK and Finland populations were comparable; therefore, descriptive statistics were performed on combined data on subtypes of IMMK and clinical features. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for impact of blepharospasm, ulceration or presence of uveitis on the outcome of enucleation and treatment duration. Results: IMMK subtype was classified as 10/94 (10.6%) epithelial, 50/94 (53.2%) anterior stromal, 14/94 (14.9%) mid-stromal, 4/94 (4.25%) endothelial and 16/94 (17.0%) unrecorded. After excluding three horses with incidental corneal ulceration, blepharospasm was documented in 34/91 (37.4%), corneal ulceration in 26/91 (28.6%), and signs of uveitis in 23/91 (25.3%) horses. Increased odds of enucleation were significantly associated with the presence of blepharospasm (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.6–19.4, p = 0.008) and signs of uveitis (OR 8.9, 95% CI 2.6–30.8, p < 0.001), but not corneal ulceration. The presence of blepharospasm, corneal ulceration or uveitis did not significantly alter the odds of ongoing medication. Main limitations: Data were collected over a wide timeframe; the diagnosis was mainly made without histopathology; a broad definition of uveitis was used and there was a bias towards complicated cases being retained for follow-up. Conclusions: The clinical features of IMMK were similar between two European countries but differed to USA descriptions. Blepharospasm, corneal ulceration and signs of uveitis can occur with IMMK; presence of blepharospasm and uveitis increase the odds of enucleation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study aims to standardize the clinical and complementary examination using surface electromyography (EMG) to assess the neuromuscular function of the equine tail. Firstly, clinical examinations of the tails and EMG measurements were performed on ten healthy animals without any tail interference or manipulation. This initial experiment aimed to establish a baseline for clinical examination and EMG results. The animals underwent tail nerve plexus blockade in the second experiment using an anesthetic agent. The objective compares the clinical examination and EMG findings between the anesthetized and non-manipulated tails. Finally, two animals were used in the third experiment, where peripheral infiltration of the tail nerve plexuses was performed using a neurolytic agent. The study successfully obtained a pattern for the clinical examination of a healthy equine tail and established a pattern for the clinical examination of a tail after infiltration with anesthetic and neurolytic agents. Significant differences were observed in the clinical examination before and after the application of local anesthesia, as well as in the EMG values before and after local infiltration with anesthetic (P=0.04) and neurolytic agent (P=0.03). The presented study introduces a clinical examination protocol that utilizes surface electromyography as a diagnostic tool for cauda equina block. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: Background: It is unknown whether short-term transportation affects endocrine responses similarly in horses with and without insulin dysregulation (ID). Objectives: To characterise the effect of short-term transportation on stress parameters and insulin responses to an oral sugar test (OST) in horses with and without ID. Study design: Longitudinal cohort study. Methods: Fourteen adult non-pregnant, non-PPID mares of mixed light breeds were grouped as either ID (n = 7) or non-ID (n = 7) based on endocrine testing. Over 2 weeks, horses were transported once, in groups of 3–4 in a horse trailer on a round-trip journey of ~1.5 h. Blood and saliva were collected 24 h and 1 h pre-transportation, directly after unloading and 15 min, 1 h, 3 h plus 24 h post-transportation. An OST was performed 24 h pre-transportation and 3 h post-transportation with a pre- (T0) and post-OST sample collected 60 min later (T60). Heart rates and rectal temperatures were also collected throughout the study. Serum insulin, serum cortisol, and plasma glucose were measured using validated assays. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to determine differences after transportation and between ID and non-ID horses. Non-normal data were log-transformed and multiple comparisons were adjusted using Bonferroni post hoc tests. Results: Mean insulin was higher in ID horses versus non-ID horses (mean = 109.9 μU/mL vs. 30.2 μU/mL, p < 0.001; 95% CI for mean difference = [55.6–107.7 μU/mL]). Mean serum insulin increased following OST at T60 in ID horses pre- (154.6 μU/mL, p = 0.04; 95% CI = [86.3–223.0 μU/mL]) and post-transportation (284.6 μU/mL, p = 0.03; 95% CI = [114.3–454.8 μU/mL]). Non-ID horses had a mean OST T60 insulin post-transportation of 56.6 μU/mL (95% CI = [29.1–84.1 μU/mL]); above recognised threshold [45 μU/mL] for ID diagnosis. Main limitations: Small number of horses, only mares used, and OST not performed immediately post-transportation. Conclusions: Performing an OST 3 h following short-term transportation may result in inaccurate ID status. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Anesthetic management in horses continues to present many challenges; however, evidence suggests that progress has been made in reducing equine anesthetic-related mortality over the past two decades. This chapter provides an evidence-based overview of the clinical considerations for equine general anesthesia, both in a hospital setting and in the field, from the preanesthetic period through recovery. A discussion of sedation and analgesia for standing procedures is also provided. © 2024 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: An accurate evaluation of the degree of sedation is mandatory to adjust the dosage of sedative drugs. Objectives: To determine the correlation between head height above the ground and ataxia degree in horses sedated with detomidine and the correlation existing between accelerometric variables and both parameters. Study design: Retrospective study. Methods: Twelve horses were given 0.01 mg/kg of detomidine hydrochloride iv. Measured accelerometric parameters, with one accelerometer positioned between both sacral tuberosities, included speed, stride frequency and length, regularity, dorsoventral, longitudinal, mediolateral and total accelerometric activities, relative force index and dorsoventral, longitudinal and mediolateral parts of the accelerometric activities. Head height above the ground (cm) and subjective ataxia degree were also measured. Baseline values (−15 min) and values measured 5 and 15 min after the injection and then every 15 min for a period of 2 h were obtained. Results: There was a negative and strong correlation between head height above the ground and ataxia degree (Pearson r = −0.78, p < 0.001), particularly during the first 45 min. A significant correlation was found between head height above the ground and almost all accelerometric parameters. This correlation was very strong with stride frequency, regularity and dorsoventral and total accelerometric activities in both cases, but for ataxia, also with total accelerometric activity. Main limitations: Experimental conditions may not represent real clinical situations. Conclusions: Stride frequency and regularity are the most reliable parameters to determine degree of sedation and are related to the sedation produced. Ataxia should not be considered a separate property of sedation and does not need to be assessed separately to the depth of sedation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Suxibuzone is a prodrug of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone. The aim of this study was to investigate the nephrotoxicity of suxibuzone using the recommended dosage in euhydrated horses. Serum creatinine levels were used to monitor for the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in 11 systemically healthy horses treated orally with suxibuzone at the recommended dosage for five days. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), urine gamma glutamyl transferase/urine creatinine, fractional excretion of sodium, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and urine sediment were assessed as additional monitoring parameters. A significant increase in creatinine was found in treated horses (P = 0.002), 27% (3/11) of treated horses were classified as having AKI compared to 0% of controls (0/10), and a strong correlation was found between the change in creatinine and the change in SDMA in treated horses (τ = 0.645, P = 0.012). The results of this study suggest that treatment with suxibuzone at the recommended dosage can induce AKI even in systemically healthy euhydrated horses. © 2024, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The genetic diversity of Breton horses in Brazil is a critical concern, mainly due to the small population size and low number of births per year. Given that the inbreeding was overlooked by breeders for multiple generations, we estimated the genetic diversity of this population utilizing pedigree-based measures of population diversity. A total of 1394 six-generation pedigrees representing the full population of registered Breton horses in Brazil defined a total population (TP, N = 2679), with horses born between 2000 and 2022, reproductively active and alive, as reported by the breed association, representing the reference population (RP, N = 731). Using the R package PurgeR, we estimated inbreeding coefficient (Fped), maternal inbreeding coefficient (Fda m), paternal inbreeding coefficient (Fsire), individual reproductive values, number of equivalents to complete generations (t), and unbiased ancestral inbreeding coefficient (Fa). We established the equivalent complete generations (ECG), effective population size (Ne), total number of founders (Nf), effective number of founders (Nfe), total number of ancestors (Na), effective number of ancestors (Nae), founder genomes (Ng), and the inbreeding coefficient estimated with effective population size (Ne) and generation numbers (t) (FNe:t), as well as Nfe/Nae and Nfe/Ng ratios for the RP. The RP inbreeding levels have stabilized, although they are still significantly rising by generation (t), and the Nfe/Ng ratio strongly suggests genetic drift. Pedigree-based analysis demonstrates that only five stallions have sired 52.83% of the RP individuals, which along with the Nae value of 36.73 implies that the observed inbreeding can be arising from patrilines. Our results suggest that observed inbreeding is due to Popular Sire Effect, highlighting the importance of monitoring breeding schemes and genetic diversity to maintain health.  © 2024 Bruno B.

ABSTRACT: The effects of the Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray used by police forces to control civil disturbances are widely known and extensively described in numerous scientific articles regarding humans. However, with the advent of animal welfare concepts, the question arises as to whether horses exposed to OC in such events would experience the same effects described in humans. The objective of this study was to determine if Mounted Police horses exposed to OC exhibit the same symptoms described in humans. In this study, 18 healthy horses from the Military Police of Paraná, without a history of respiratory disease, were led through a cloud of gas created using six pepper spray dispensers. Physiological parameters including respiratory rate, heart rate, rectal temperature, and conjunctival color were evaluated 24 hours before exposure, 30 minutes, and 24 hours after exposure. Blood samples were collected for a complete blood count and blood gas analysis, and samples of the ocular mucosa were obtained using sterile swabs. Analysis of these parameters did not reveal effects analogous to those described in humans. The absence of ocular changes is directly correlated with the primary decontamination method in humans, which involves running with open eyes to allow the air to act against them. In the case of horses, the movement of their eyes while walking at an average speed of 6km/h in a walk and 18km/h in a trot generates airflow throughout the entire body of the animal. Additionally, pieces of tack and parts of the rider’s body form a barrier against the action of the OC agent by reducing the contact area. After 30 minutes and 24 hours post-exposure, no aggressive effects like those found in humans in the airways and ocular mucosa were observed. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: There is not a welfare protocol for horses reared for meat production in semi-extensive systems. The aims of the study were to develop a specific welfare protocol suitable to be applied at pasture and on stable; and to evaluate whether the welfare items were influenced by the farming system (pasture vs stable). 52 non-animal-based measures (N-ABMs) and 14 animal-based measures (ABMs), classified into 6 thematic areas (training, feeding, facilities, ABMs, biosecurity, health management) were selected by a focus group. The protocol was applied on a total of 429 Catria horses located across 26 pastures during the warm seasons and on 7 stables during the cold seasons. Differences obtained within each horse-unit were calculated by using the diversity index (VARNC) and the distance from the ideal (dfi) index. Chi-square test was used for comparing the relative frequencies (%) of the answers (pasture vs stable). Most the welfare items were classified as adequate in both pasture and stable, yet differences were found within ‘training’ (p = 0.02) and ‘feeding’ (p < 0.01) areas in relation to the welfare items ‘inspection of the animals’ and ‘feeding management’. Weaknesses of both pasture and stable were represented by some welfare items in the ‘health management’ and ‘biosecurity’ areas. After proper validation, the welfare protocol developed in the present study could help to fill the existing gap of knowledge on horse welfare assessment for semi-extensive system systems, providing support for official control of veterinarians and enabling the identification of key weakness to address preventive interventions. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Surveillance of Strongylus vulgaris and other Strongylus spp. in equids is important for targeted intervention in parasite control, requiring reliable routine diagnostic methods. Objectives: Comparing morphological examination and PCR analyses of larval cultures to identify Strongylus spp. species based on German diagnostic samples from 2018. Study design: Method comparison. Methods: During the routine diagnostic investigations, in total 712 strongyle-egg positive equine faecal samples were cultured. Third-stage larvae (L3) were morphologically differentiated. For molecular validation, samples were examined using S. vulgaris real-time PCR and Strongylus edentatus/Strongylus equinus/Strongylus asini high-resolution melting PCRs. Results: Based on 28S rRNA PCR, 594 samples positive for nematode DNA were included in the study. The inter-rater reliability to compare morphological and molecular species identification was fair for Strongylus spp. without species identification and for S. edentatus, slight for S. equinus and poor for S. vulgaris. The frequency based on morphological and molecular data in this study were for S. vulgaris 0% and 0.8%, respectively, for S. edentatus 0.3% and 1.5%, respectively, and for S. equinus 2.0% and 0.2%, respectively. Based on molecular analyses, one sample obtained from a domestic horse contained S. asini DNA, which was confirmed by sequencing. Main limitations: For many samples, no or only incomplete data regarding clinical history, the exact geographical location and whether samples were obtained on individual or farm level, were available. Conclusions: Results of morphological and molecular examination methods of strongyle L3 from equine samples can differ substantially. Further evaluation of these methods is required to provide reliable and cost-effective methods of screening equine parasites. Further studies using approaches suitable to detect S. asini are needed to evaluate its clinical and epidemiological relevance. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The main purpose of the present study was to determine and evaluate the heavy metals in soil, forage and blood plasma of horses in Central Punjab, Pakistan. Concentrations of metals, cobalt (Co), selenium (Se), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) in these samples were determined. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentration of metals. The concentrations of all the analysed heavy metals differed significantly with different seasonal periods. The mean Fe, Co, Mn and Se values in blood plasma samples of 4 years (Cohort-8), 3 years (Cohort-9) and 2 years (Cohort-10) cohorts were 1.34, 0.18, 0.026 and 0.019 mg/L; 1.23, 0.17, 0.026 and 0.015 mg/L and 1.19, 0.15, 0.029 and 0.015 mg/L, respectively. No statistically significant changes were observed for heavy metal concentrations in plasma samples of horses according to two sampling seasons. The present results indicated that heavy metals in soil, forage and blood plasma samples were lower than the recommended critical levels except for the Mn accumulation in forage samples.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine corneal disease is common and painful. Current pain mitigation strategies are often suboptimal, especially early in the disease. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of local anaesthetic delivery via indwelling retrobulbar catheter on corneal sensitivity, pupil size, pupillary light responses (PLRs), and ocular motility in normal horses. Study design: Randomised, controlled crossover experiment. Methods: One eye was randomly selected from seven horses. A 20-gauge catheter was placed in the retrobulbar space and injected with 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine or 0.9% saline. Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry (CBE), pupil photogrammetry, PLRs, and oculocephalic reflexes were evaluated before injection (t = 0) and t = 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h after injection. Following a 7–14 day washout period, this procedure was repeated using the alternative injection solution. Corneal touch thresholds (CTTs) derived from CBE and pupillary areas (PA; as measured from photographs) were compared across time for each group. PLRs and oculocephalic reflexes were compared between groups at each evaluation time point. Results: Saline did not affect CBE, PA, PLRs or oculocephalic reflexes at any time point. Bupivacaine reduced CTT compared with saline for 6 h, with maximum reduction at t = 1 h (bupivacaine: 0.08 ± 0.20 cm; saline: 4.21 ± 0.39 cm; p < 0.001). Bupivacaine increased PA compared with saline for 3 h, with maximum increase at t = 3 h (bupivacaine: 349.75 ± 84.80 mm2; saline: 194.65 ± 27.03 mm2; p = 0.04). Bupivacaine injection reduced PLRs for 9 h and oculocephalic reflexes for 3 h; saline had no effect. Mild adverse effects included chemosis, blepharoedema, and transiently reduced palpebral reflex. Main limitations: Reduction in CTT may not directly translate to pain control in clinical horses with corneal disease. Adverse effects of repeated injections were not evaluated. Conclusions: Injection of bupivacaine via an indwelling retrobulbar catheter in horses reduces corneal sensitivity and may be useful in reducing pain in horses with corneal disease. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Lymphoma is the most common malignant haemolymphatic neoplasm in the horse, with a predominance of multicentric T-cell-rich large B-cell lymphoma. Anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma is a rare subtype of T-cell lymphoma characterised by presence of atypical neoplastic lymphoid cells with kidney-shaped or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. This case report describes an unusual presentation of a lymphoma with morphological and immunohistological features of an anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma with oral mucosal involvement in a horse that was originally presented with erosive to ulcerative stomatitis. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Interference events, such as unwanted feeding of horses by passers-by and removal of equipment, can compromise equine health and pose a risk to human safety (e.g., from equine bites). With altered exercising behavior during COVID-19 restrictions came reports of an increase in such events. Our study’s main purpose was to estimate the extent of these and, as a secondary aim, gauge whether their frequency changed during COVID-19 lockdowns. We used two surveys: one aimed at UK horse owners (n = 1,017) and the other open to owners worldwide (n = 2,747). Unwanted feeding was a common event, reported by 77% of UK-based owners, representing a real source of welfare concern: 28% of horses fed suffered aftereffects and 16% of these later died. Globally, interference events, including feeding, are similarly common–80% of owners reported events ranging from stroking through to more serious situations (e.g., dog attacks). Perceptions of how COVID-19 affected interference events were mixed. Going forward, we suggest that improved public education and, ultimately, behavior change toward animals belonging to others is required. Owners have some responsibility in achieving this; for example, with improved physical barriers like hedgerows between public spaces and their horses (whilst ensuring rights of way remain unobstructed). © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: The return to performance after colic surgery is crucial for competition horses. While studies have investigated racehorse performance following colic surgery by analysing racing participation and earnings, this approach does not apply to showjumping horses, leaving a gap in the literature regarding their objective performance evaluation. Objectives: To assess the short- and long-term survival and return to performance in showjumping horses after colic surgery. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Medical records of horses with acute colic requiring surgical treatment were analysed, and data for showjumping horses (Group 1) were retrieved. Telephone follow-ups were conducted and national competition databases were used to collect pre- and postoperative showjumping competition entries for Group 1 and for randomly selected horses (Group 2) participating in the same competitions as a comparison group. Results: Of 253 horses undergoing colic surgery, 96 were recorded as showjumpers. The median long-term survival was 2.73 (0.01–6.14) years. Among these horses, 59 were competing at the time of surgery, and of these, 46 (78%) returned to competition and 41 (89.1%) competed at the same or higher level, while 5 (10.9%) competed at a lower level. At a 2-year follow-up, 63.6% of the showjumping horses that underwent colic surgery were alive. No significant differences were observed in the level of competition and career length between horses, which underwent colic surgery, and the randomly selected comparison group. Main limitations: Small sample size and a single-centre design. Conclusions: Showjumping horses can make a successful return to competition after colic surgery, with the majority performing at the same or higher level as before the procedure. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Pastern ultrasonography remains a useful and affordable choice, whether it is used in the field or when advanced imaging is not an option due to availability or cost considerations. Tent pegging is a high-speed sport practiced since the 4th century BC. There is a paucity of literature available about injuries associated with this type of sport. Aim of work: To study the incidence of soft tissue injuries at the pastern region in tent-pegging horses. Materials and methods: Ultrasonographic study was carried out on the palmar pastern region of 46 forelimbs (23 horses) to detect the different soft tissue injuries that occurred in association with this kind of sport. Results: Bilateral SDF chronic tendonitis was the highest percentage of the scanned affections, representing (52.2%). The most affected level in the SDFT was the right P1A (60.9%) and also showed a significant positive correlation with age. Conclusion: Longterm exposure to tent-pegging sports and poor rehabilitation programs lead to chronic tendonitis and adhesions, which subsequently lead to poor performance. © 2024, A Zohier, T Baraka, A Abdelgalil, A Aboelmaaty, SG Yehia

ABSTRACT: The present study was performed by conducting interviews with 382 horse owners and managers between April 2019 and March 2022 to examine biosecurity implementations on non-commercial horse properties in Turkey and the attitudes and behaviors of horse owners toward viral horse diseases and explain the procedures that visitors should follow. Data were collected with a semi-structured questionnaire. While collecting data from horse owners, 548 nasal swabs were taken from horses on properties to detect equine viral arteritis infection. Correlations between property-level variables and biosecurity implementations in horses were analyzed by logistic regression. Swap samples were investigated for equine arteritis virus antigen by PCR. While 341 (89.27%) of horse owners and managers reported that they applied biosecurity procedures to check the health of newly arrived horses on the property, 125 (32.72%) stated that they applied isolation as a standard procedure upon the entry of horses to the property. On properties where isolation was not routinely applied, the main reason for isolating horses was an illness that emerged on other properties (n=78). Few participants (n=44) checked new horses for fever or other clinical symptoms of infectious disease. Only 54 (14.14%) horse managers reported that they applied visitor procedures. Within the general framework, 301 (78.79%) of horse properties were visited by a horse specialist, but 51 (13.35%) reported the biosecurity procedure for these visits. The obtained findings simplify a better insight of property owners’ effective decision-making processes behind horse health discretions and can meet feedback to the sector stakeholders on influential biosecurity implementations. © 2024, OB Ince, Y Paksoy, A Sait

ABSTRACT: Detection and monitoring of biomarkers related to doping is particularly suitable for the development of analytical strategies dedicated to indirect detection of banned substances. Previous studies in horses have already allowed the investigation of transcriptomic biomarkers in equine blood associated with reGH and rHuEPO administrations. Our most recent developments continue to focus on the discovery and monitoring of transcriptomic biomarkers for the control of ESAs, and a collaborative study with WADA-accredited doping control laboratories has recently been initiated to conduct a pilot study. In humans, three mRNAs (ALAS2, CA1, and SLC4A1) were previously observed to be differentially expressed after blood doping and were associated with immature red blood cells, the so-called circulating reticulocytes. In horses, circulating reticulocytes are rarely observed even after rHuEPO administration. With the improved primers that detect the equine orthologues of the human mRNAs from the ALAS2, CA1, and SLC4A1 genes, we can now report the first evidence of the detection of the three biomarkers in equine blood. In addition, an upregulation of the mRNA levels of the three genes was observed after analysis of blood samples collected from MirCERA-treated animals, with kinetics similar to those previously documented in humans. Our data suggest that ALAS2 and CA1 are promising indirect biomarkers for the detection of recombinant EPO abuse in horses, as observed in humans. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Twelve horses weighing 570 ± 35 kg were split into two groups (standard protein, STD, and balanced protein, BAL) to evaluate the effect of balanced vs. unbalanced protein on muscle mass. Groups were fed grass hay and a 12% CP feed (one formulated for balanced protein). Horses were out of work for 14 wk prior and participated in 1 to 2 h of light-to-moderate exercise 5 d/wk for 12 wk. A 4-d total urine and feces collection period was conducted at the start and end of the study. Urine and feces samples were analyzed for nitrogen (N) to calculate N balance. Muscle mass status was evaluated using histochemistry, muscle scoring, and body measurements at the start and end of the study. Muscle biopsies were analyzed for free amino acid concentrations. An ANOVA was done using the Proc MIXED function of SAS (2006). Nitrogen retention was greater and urine nitrogen as a percent of intake less for the STD group at the end of the study (P = 0.01). Muscle free concentrations of methionine, leucine, phenylalanine, and arginine were greater in the BAL group at the end of the study compared to the STD group (P < 0.04) while muscle free histidine, threonine, and valine were less for the STD group at the end of the study compared to the start of the study (P < 0.05). Muscle fiber diameters were greater at the start of the study for the STD group (P = 0.004) but greater for the BAL group at the end of the study (P = 0.001). There is some evidence of improved muscle mass for the BAL group with greater muscle free amino acids (arginine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and valine) as well as greater type II muscle fiber areas and diameters. While changes did not appear evident between groups at the "whole body"level, changes at the tissue level appear more evident.  © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Polycythaemia and coagulopathy are identified risk factors for non-survival in critically ill horses. Assessment of coagulation is recommended for critical care monitoring but may be affected by concurrent polycythaemia. Objective: To evaluate the effects of induced polycythaemia on coagulation parameters as measured by a point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation device (VCM Vet™). Study design: Prospective interventional study. Methods: Healthy adult horses (n = 7) were given 6 mcg/kg of phenylephrine IV over 15 min to induce transient polycythaemia. Samples for packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), complete blood count (CBC), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), prothrombin (PT) and VCM Vet™ viscoelastic testing were collected at baseline (T0), 5 min (T1) and 2 h (T2) post-phenylephrine infusion. Splenic volume was measured by transabdominal ultrasonography. VCM Vet™ and plasma-based coagulation parameters, splenic volume and haematologic values were compared within and between time points. Results: Splenic volume decreased from T0 (11.5 ± 4.8 L) to T1 (6.1 ± 2 L, p = 0.04) and returned to baseline volume by T2 (12.1 ± 3.9 L, p = 0.8), consistent with phenylephrine-induced splenic contraction. PCV increased from T0 (37% ± 4%) to T1 (56.3% ± 5.3%; p < 0.001) and returned to baseline at T2 (41.6% ± 3.6%; p = 0.1). A10 and A20 (amplitude at 10 and 20 min, VCM units) were decreased from T0 (12.6 ± 1.6, 18.9 ± 5) to T1 (5.4 ± 1.9, 7.6 ± 2.4; both p < 0.001) and remained lower than baseline at T2 (9.3 ± 2.1, 12.7 ± 3; both p = 0.01). PT and PTT remained within reference ranges with no significant difference over time (p = 0.5 and 0.09, respectively). PCV was negatively correlated with CFT (R = −0.61, p = 0.003), A10 (R = −0.9, p < 0.001) and A20 (R = −0.87, p < 0.001). Main limitations: Small sample size, limited to healthy mares. Conclusions: Phenylephrine-induced polycythaemia was associated with hypocoagulable viscoelastic traces using the VCM Vet™ device without effect on plasma-based coagulation assessments or platelet number. Further investigation of viscoelastic testing is needed in horses with increased PCV due to clinical illness. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Research on equine-assisted therapy (EAT) has primarily been centered on human health. Relatively few studies have addressed the impact of EAT on horses. This study sought to monitor four experienced therapy horses’ cardiovascular and glucocorticoid activity over the course of standardized EAT sessions designed to support women with intellectual disability. In the control condition, horses completed the EAT protocol solely with the therapist, thereby resembling a training session. Descriptive data analysis revealed higher levels of heart rate during an experimental EAT session and increased salivary cortisol when horses were navigated by the client through an obstacle course during the “challenge” phase of the protocol, pointing at a greater physical demand due to the recipient on horseback. Given the parasympathetic activity and overall heart rate variability across experimental EAT sessions and the cortisol recovery after the sessions, the findings do not give rise to any acute animal welfare concerns. For a more holistic interpretation of the present research results, further investigation into the horse perception of EAT, based on a bigger sample size and additional markers of welfare, is needed. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Trachurus trachurus (Linné, 1758) is widely represented in Tunisian catches. These quantities landed varied according to the areas and seasons. Taking into account the quantitative importance and economic contributions for the fishing sector, it is useful to assess the biomass and locate areas of concentration. Exploration and experimental trawling operations are carried out aboard the oceanographic vessel O/V “Hannibal” in all Tunisian waters. This study focuses on the results obtained in the North and East areas of Tunisia. In the East area, the depth prospected vary from 40 to 227 m with 49 hauls and that of the North area oscillate between 30 and 512 m and 53 hauls. Three important areas of Trachurus trachurus concentration were reported in the Eastern waters, particularly in the Gulf of Hammamet, above the Curba banks, Mamur and Hallouf. The overall biomass index varies, depending on the area, from 100 to 455 kg/km2. In the Northern waters, 4 specific areas of concentration of this species were noted, including a particularly important toward the North East of the Gulf of Tunis, above the El Hawaria bank at depths of 100 m. The 3 other areas were, respectively, the north of Bizerte, above the Cani Islands bank; above Stafette and Fratelli benches and toward the extreme northwest of Tunisia, south of Galite. The biomass index estimated ranges from 118 to 532 kg/km2. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic represented a significant source of anxiety and stress for equine veterinarians and clients, with the potential for measurable effects on caseload and owner economics. Objective: To compare the number of horses presenting for emergency colic evaluation and treatment, as well as costs at two equine referral hospitals. Study design: Retrospective cohort. Methods: Medical records of horses admitted to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic (BEVC) were compared. Total equine accessions, number of horses referred for colic and patient age were recorded over an 11-year period (2013–2023). Horses were categorised based on treatment as medical, surgical treatment with recovery, surgical exploration with intraoperative euthanasia, or euthanasia without surgery. Total invoice of each case was also recorded. Results: Total equine accessions, total number and proportion of horses presenting for evaluation of colic, and number of horses recovering from colic surgery at NCSU increased following onset of the pandemic, while they remained similar to pre-pandemic levels at BEVC. The proportion of horses presenting for colic that received surgery decreased at both hospitals over the study period. Mean invoice totals for horses surviving colic surgery increased at both hospitals over the study period, but was not significantly associated with euthanasia. Age was not significantly different between categories of colic. Main limitations: Retrospective study design, differences in academic and private practices. Conclusions: The decreasing proportion of horses admitted for colic that received surgery is likely due to the increased caseload of first-opinion care at referral practices during the pandemic, as fewer options were available to owners. The increasing number of horses euthanised intraoperatively or euthanised without receiving surgery may be due to the dramatically rising costs of medical care, particularly surgery. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Platelet lysate, derived from platelets, are valuable biological products rich in bioactive molecules. Their use promotes tissue healing and modulates inflammation. However, maintaining the stability and bioactivity of platelet lysate is challenging since they degrade rapidly at room temperature. This study focused on the possibility to confer enhanced stability to freeze-dried equine platelet lysate as an alternative to platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Platelet lysate (PL) was derived from PRP and freeze-dried either as such or using various adjuvants. Primary cell cultures of porcine Vascular Wall-Mesenchymal Stem Cells were treated with different PL formulations, and cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay. Overall, the addition of PL significantly improved cell viability as compared to controls without growth factor supplementation or with foetal bovine serum. Notably, the freeze-drying process maintained the effectiveness of the PL for at least a week. Furthermore, the study revealed that varying the horse as the source of PL could yield varying effects on cell viability. Detailed freeze-drying protocols were established, including freezing, primary drying and secondary drying phases, and the type of adjuvant. This study demonstrated the potential of freeze-dried equine PL as a viable alternative to PRP and highlighted the importance of precise freeze-drying protocols and adjuvants for standardization. Equine PL showed promise for medical treatment in horses, offering advantages such as extended shelf life, ease of handling, and reduced transportation costs, with the potential for broadened therapeutic usage. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Commercial textile dyes are a leading cause of industrial water pollution. We report here the results of the first study to assess the bioremediation potential of the heme proteins horse hemoglobin and horse heart myoglobin in the rapid decolorization of four common classes of synthetic dyes with hydrogen peroxide. The results demonstrate that horse hemoglobin or horse heart myoglobin, along with hydrogen peroxide, decolorize all four tested dyes, namely, the anthraquinone dye, RB-19; the azo dye, xylidine ponceau; the indigoid dye, indigo carmine; and the triarylmethane dye, malachite green. Michaelis-Menten kinetics indicate that horse hemoglobin decolorized all four dye types significantly faster and more efficiently than horse heart myoglobin, under a wide range of pH conditions (6.5 to 9.0) and hydrogen peroxide concentrations (5 to 60 mM), suggesting that the difference arises in part from the presence of four heme sites in tetrameric horse hemoglobin that are involved in the decolorization reaction, as compared to the single heme site in monomeric horse heart myoglobin. Horse hemoglobin and horse heart myoglobin both decolorized indigo carmine and the anthraquinone dye RB-19 significantly faster than the azo dye xylidine ponceau and the cationic triarylmethane dye malachite green, suggesting that the structures of the dyes and specific interactions between the dye and the heme protein also affect the observed decolorization rates. This study demonstrates the promise of these two heme proteins as potential green catalysts for decolorizing a wide range of industrial dyes and organic compounds in water treatment. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Pupillometry is used in humans to monitor pain, nociception and analgesia. This single-center, non-randomized, non-blinded intervention trial, evaluated the effect of nose twitching on the pupil size in awake, sedated, and anesthetized horses. Pupil height (H) and length (L) were measured before (Be) and after (Af) nose twitching in fourteen non-painful adult awake horses (T0). The percentage of variation (PSV) was calculated (PSVTn = [(TnAf-TnBe)/TnBe]*100). Measurements were repeated (Tn) after acepromazine (0.04 mg kg−1 IV) (T1), romifidine (0.04 mg kg−1 IV) (T2), morphine (0.1 mg kg−1 IV) (T3), after anesthesia induction with diazepam (0.05 mg kg−1 IV) and ketamine (2.2 mg kg−1 IV), at the time the horse was placed on the operating table (T4) and when the expiratory fraction of sevoflurane was 2% (T5). HAf vs. HBe, LAf vs. LBe as well as PSVH vs. PSVL at each time were compared with a Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon test. The PSVL and PSVH, as well as HBe and LBe over time were compared with the Skillings-Mack test followed by a Wilcoxon test for paired data to make pairwise comparisons (Tn + 1 vs. Tn). In non-sedated horses (T0), the application of the nose twitch induced a significant increase in pupil length (LT0Be: 17.09 [16.05; 19.67] mm versus LT0Af: 19.52 [18.74; 21.40]) mm (p = 0.004). Thirty minutes after acepromazine administration (T1), nose twitching induced a significant increase in pupil length (LT1Be: 16.45 [14.80; 18.66] mm versus LT1Af 18.31 [17.20; 20.52] mm) (p = 0.016) and height (HT1Be: 8.44 [5.68; 12.04] mm versus HT1Af: 11.09 [7.97; 14.3] mm) (p < 0.001). PSVHT1 was significantly greater than PSVLT1 (p = 0.025). PSVH was higher at T1 than at T0 (p = 0.04). It was also significantly higher at T1 than at T2 (p < 0.001). Romifidine induced mydriasis (HT2Be 16.95 [14.73; 18.77] mm versus HT1Be 8.44 [5.68; 12.04] mm) (p < 0,001) (LT2Be 19.66 [18.45; 20.41] mm versus LT1Be 16.45 [14.80; 18.66] mm) (p < 0.001). The results suggest that nose twitching induced a pupillary dilation in the awake horse. This effect was potentiated after the administration of acepromazine but disappeared after the administration of romifidine. Copyright © 2024 Mascaró Triedo, Karar, Abunemeh and Portier.

ABSTRACT: Equine chiropractic is a commonly practised medicine but is not yet supported by scientific evidence. This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects of chiropractic on healthy horses using objective animal-based measures of heart rate variability (HRV), infrared thermography (IRT of the eye), and behavioural discomfort score (BDS). Eight mares were selected and underwent a 15-day habituation period to chiropractic care. The mares were then randomly assigned to grooming (CTRL) and chiropractic (CHIRO) sessions, both performed by the same qualified chiropractor. During CHIRO, the chiropractor assessed musculoskeletal hypomobility and treated the mares accordingly, whereas, during CTRL, grooming was performed on the same body regions as CHIRO. The experimental procedures were repeated after 10 days. Before (Pre), during (Dur), and after (Post) both sessions, HRV was continuously recorded and the horses were video-recorded. Maximum eye temperature (Te) was recorded before (T0), after (T1), and the day after (T24) each session. The effect of phase (i.e., PreBasal vs DurCTRL vs DurCHIRO vs PostCTRL vs PostCHIRO; T0Basal vs T1CTRL vsT1CHIRO vs T24CTRL vsT24CHIRO) was tested with linear mixed models. No differences were found for HRV and Te, suggesting that the autonomic response to CHIRO and CTRL was equal and not altered from the baseline value (Pre/T0). Conversely, BDS differed in CHIRO (p<0.01), increasing Dur and decreasing Post. In conclusion, chiropractic caused a transient discomfort, without any sympathetic shift. Therefore, thanks to smart technologies, we can objectively confirm that chiropractic could be performed by experts causing transient behavioural discomfort without physiological distress and pain in horses. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

ABSTRACT: Probiotics are commonly incorporated into equine diets to impart health and performance benefits; however, peer-reviewed evidence supporting their efficacy in horses is limited. Interestingly, bacteria from the Bacillus genus are gaining interest for their unique ability to impact metabolic, immune, and inflammatory pathways. The objective of this trial was to evaluate a selection of Bacilli for their role in altering the inflammatory response in horses to exercise. Eighteen horses were utilized in a randomized cross-over trial. Horses were randomly assigned to one of 6 starting treatments including a negative and positive control, and groups that received one of 4 probiotics (Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086, Bacillus subtilis-1, Bacillus subtilis-2, or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) top dressed to their daily ration at a rate of 8 billion CFU/d mixed into dried whey powder. All horses received a similar base diet of grass hay offered at 2.0% of bodyweight daily along with 4.54 kg of a commercially available textured horse feed. Each 3-wk phase of the trial consisted of a 2-wk dietary acclimation followed by a 1-wk exercise challenge and sample collection. Between phases, horses were offered only their base diet. On the day of exercise, horses were offered their 0700 ration and then subjected to a 2-h standardized exercise test. Blood samples were obtained prior to starting exercise and then again at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 72-h postexercise. Horses in the positive control group were administered 0.23 mg/kg BW flunixin meglumine immediately following the 0-h sampling. Samples were analyzed for serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations. Data were evaluated via ANOVA using the MIXED procedure in SAS 9.4. Exercise-induced inflammation as evidenced by SAA, IL-6, and PGE2 increases postexercise. Horses consuming B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 had reduced production of SAA, IL-6, and PGE2 compared to all other probiotic-fed groups and the negative control (P < 0.001). The positive control successfully ameliorated the postexercise inflammatory response. These data highlight the potential for B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 to be incorporated into equine rations as a method to support optimal response to exercise or other inflammation-inducing challenges. Additional research is ongoing to elucidate the methodology by which these results occur. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Saddles are almost certainly one of the most commonly used pieces of equipment and are used by the majority of riders in many equestrian disciplines. Despite a large number of studies relating to saddle fit and function, there appear to be no published data describing the basic demographics of saddle use, rider preferences or discipline differences. This study was designed as an online survey consisting of 20 closed questions and 4 open free text questions split into three sections: (1) participant demographics; (2) saddle use; and (3) impact of saddle use on the horse and rider. The survey was live for 20 days and 65% of the responses were obtained within the first 8 days. A total of 4,527 horse owners/keepers undertook the survey with 3,624 complete responses (80.1% completion rate). The majority of respondents were female (98.1%, n = 3,555). The four most popular disciplines respondents participated in were pleasure riding/hacking (82.6%, n = 2,994), dressage (71.6%, n = 2,595), show jumping (48.2%, n = 1,747) and eventing (33.3%, n = 1,205). Most horse owners and keepers engaged in non-competitive or local/unaffiliated level competition (59.0%, n = 2,136). The majority of respondents (59.2%, n = 2,145) did not use saddles on more than one horse. When selecting a saddle, respondents valued comfort for the horse as essential (92.6%, n = 4,073), followed by injury prevention (essential; 66.5%, n = 2,838) and then performance related attributes (essential; 56.9%, n = 2,459). When selecting a saddle to buy, durability was the most important feature for respondents (92.5%), who also rated weight, price, and leather (63.0%, 66.5% and 67.7%, respectively) as key attributes they would require. © 2024 D.J.

ABSTRACT: Fourier-transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) has recently been used to reduce the processing time for estimates of annual age in several fish species. The present study represents the first application of this technique to marine organisms from the European waters. Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) from the central Mediterranean Sea was selected for its ecological role, its socioeconomic value, and because its age is regularly estimated by otolith reading under a stereomicroscope for stock assessment purposes. Absorption spectra of the whole otoliths were acquired by FT-NIRS across a multiyear dataset, obtained during acoustic surveys carried out in different regions of the central Mediterranean Sea. The acquired spectra were processed to optimize calibration models to predict age. The best linear models obtained by the optimizing procedure predicted age successfully with a coefficient of determination of 0.95–0.96, mean squared error of 0.5 years, and bias <0.03 years. Although regional calibration models were also obtained separately, the models with all regions combined appeared much more robust and encompassing the whole age range, suggesting its usefulness for the entire spatial distribution range considered in the preset study. The use of FT-NIRS allowed to successfully predict age for horse mackerel between the ages 1 and 14, with similar or better precision (and bias) of the traditional methods, also increasing the standardization by repeatability of age assignments. The preliminary results obtained by this study encourage further effort to fine-tune the calibration model for new species, in order to apply a precise, rapid, cost-effective method for stock assessment purposes of Mediterranean fish resources.

ABSTRACT: Fosfomycin (FOM) is an approved veterinary medicinal product for large animals in Japan, but Clinical breakpoint (CBP) for antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) is not defined for animals. This study aimed at conducting a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) analysis to determine the PK/PD cutoff for the CBP in horses. Drug concentrations following single intravenous administration (IV) of 20 mg/kg body weight (BW) FOM in nine horses were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The data were modelled using a nonlinear mixed-effects model, followed by Monte Carlo simulations. A 90% probability of target attainment for a PK/PD target of the ratio of Area Under the free plasma concentration-time curve divided by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) >24 hr was set as PK/PD cut-off. The PK/PD cutoff for FOM 20 mg/ kg BW q12 hr IV was estimated with the MIC value of ≤16.0 mg/L, and this regimen was considered effective against E. coli (MIC90; 16.0 mg/L) in healthy horses based on the MIC90 values of the wild population. Owing to the relevance of FOM to human health, veterinarians should use q 12 hr FOM 20 mg/kg against E. coli infections with an MIC <16 µg/mL, as suggested by our PK/PD cutoff after AST. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are being used increasingly in equine practice. While there is emerging clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of these drugs, there are currently no reports to document owner experiences with treatment. Objective: The objective of the study was to report owner experiences and observations following treatment with SGLT2i in horses. Study design: A cross-sectional online survey. Methods: Horse owners were recruited via social media, online forums and their veterinarians to participate in an anonymous online survey to document their experiences and observations when treating their horses with SGLT2i. Results: Three hundred forty-two responses met the inclusion criteria. Ertugliflozin was the most commonly prescribed SGLT2i (79.8%), and the most common reasons for treatment were high insulin concentrations (84.2%) and active laminitis (59.7%). 85.3% of owners reported their horses had an improved quality of life after commencing treatment, while 9.4% reported no change and 5.3% reported a worsening of clinical signs. Of owners who had considered euthanasia prior to treatment (n = 77), 80.5% reported their horse's level of pain to be either mild or absent after 30 days of treatment and 94.8% reported their horse's quality of life to be improved. Most owners (n = 220, 64.7%) reported they were either extremely satisfied or somewhat satisfied (n = 72, 21.2%) with treatment. Treatment concerns included safety/side effects, medication cost, availability and long-term efficacy. 114 owners (33.3%) reported one or more initial adverse effects upon induction onto the medication, particularly excessive urination (n = 70, 20.5%), excessive drinking (n = 38, 11.1%), excessive weight loss (n = 34, 9.9%) and dullness (n = 26, 7.6%). Main limitation: Sampling bias through social media and veterinary practices and reliance on subjective owner reports. Conclusion: The use of SGLT2i in horses was associated with excellent rates of owner satisfaction and owner-reported improved quality of life for the horse; however, some adverse effects were observed. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of supplemental β-alanine feeding on the athletic performance of Yili horses involved in speed racing, focusing on alterations in plasma free amino acid patterns pre and post exercise. Additionally, the research aimed to evaluate the effects of carnosine on the plasma acid–base buffering capacity and antioxidant levels in these horses. Twelve Yili horse stallions, averaging 3 years in age and 346.50 ± 21.39 kg in weight, were chosen and randomly divided into two groups: a control group and a test group, each comprising six horses. The control group received a supplementation of 300 mg/kg BW/day of α-alanine, while the test group received 300 mg/kg BW/day of β-alanine. This supplementation regimen was maintained for a 30-day supplementation trial period, under identical feeding and management conditions. Throughout the trial, the horses participated in the 1,000 Speed Race, and three distinct blood samples were gathered for assessing plasma free amino acids, blood gases, biochemical parameters, and antioxidant parameters. The outcomes indicated a considerable enhancement in the 1,000 m exercise performance of the speed racing Yili horses in the test group compared to the control group, showcasing a noteworthy improvement of 12.01%, with the test group completing the race 13.29 s faster. Notably, the α-alanine content in the plasma of the control group Yili horses remained higher than that of the test group, demonstrating a consistent increasing trend. By contrast, the plasma β-alanine content was notably higher in the test group than in the control group. Over the course of the supplementation period, plasma β-alanine exhibited an escalating and then stabilizing trend in the test group, whereas in the control group, although β-alanine content also increased, the trend was less pronounced. The plasma levels of histidine and carnosine showed minimal variance between the two groups. Overall, the test group of Yili horses exhibited slightly higher plasma levels of histidine and carnosine compared to the control group. The addition of β-alanine to their diet for a duration of 30 days notably affected the plasma levels of amino acids both pre- and post-exercise in speed-racing Yili horses. Furthermore, β-alanine demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the catabolism of these horses’ bodies during high-intensity exercise. Ten marker amino acids, including valine, leucine, β-alanine, isoleucine, carnosine, 3-methyl-histidine, lysine, ethanolamine, argnine, and taurine, displayed statistically significant changes. β-alanine notably increased the blood glucose levels of Yili horses and played a role in expediting the restoration of blood gas levels post-exercise. Moreover, in the test group of Yili horses, the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity significantly increased both before and after the race, while the content of malondialdehyde, an oxidation product, exhibited an extremely significant decrease immediately after the race. These outcomes suggest that the addition of β-alanine significantly augmented antioxidant levels during high-intensity exercise in Yili horses. Consequently, it reduced post-exercise injuries and accelerated the recovery process after exercise. Copyright © 2024 Li, Ma, Li, Li, Ma, Deng and Yang.

ABSTRACT: Background: Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is caused by Taylorella equigenitalis. It is a venereal disease that is detected in some breeds more than others and can cause temporary infertility with substantial costs for regular testing, sanitation and retesting. There was a perceived increase in T. equigenitalis-positive cases in Icelandic intact males where natural cover is common. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the prevalence of T. equigenitalis in Icelandic intact males and compare to draught horse and Haflinger intact males. We hypothesised that prevalence of T. equigenitalis is higher in Icelandic compared with draught and Haflinger intact males. Study design: Cross sectional. Methods: Swabs from 76 Icelandic, 35 Haflinger, and 51 draught horse intact males were collected on 38 different farms and analysed by qPCR. Animals were further stratified into active breeding and non-breeding animals and age groups (1.5–7.0 and 8.0–26.0 years). Fisher's exact tests and mixed effect logistic regression with ‘farm’ as random effect were used to estimate differences in odds for T. equigenitalis-positive test results. Results: The overall prevalence of T. equigenitalis in included intact males was 16.7% (27/162). The odds for T. equigenitalis-positive intact males were significantly higher in Icelandic compared with draught and Haflinger intact males (Odds ratio [OR] = 6.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.43–28.8, p = 0.02). Odds for T. equigenitalis-positive intact males were significantly lower in active breeding compared with non-breeding animals (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01–0.54, p = 0.009). Age had no significant influence on test results. Main limitations: Convenience sampling with regional restrictions to Southern Germany and Austria, small sample size. Conclusions: Significantly higher odds for T. equigenitalis-positive intact males were found within Icelandic over draught and Haflinger and within non-breeding animals compared with active breeding animals. Findings suggest that non-breeding animals could be a reservoir for T. equigenitalis. Testing for CEM should therefore be routinely performed in Icelandic horses prior to breeding and investigations into epidemiology and reservoirs on affected farms should be initiated. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Brucellosis is a significant zoonotic disease that poses both health and economic risks. It is endemic in many developing countries, such as Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Brucella abortus infection in native horses in the suburbs of Tabriz, Iran, using serological methods. Blood samples were collected from 141 apparently healthy horses, 45 of which were less than five years old, and 96 were more than five years old. Additionally, 35 were female and 106 were male. The Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), Standard Tube Agglutination Test (STAT), 2-Mercaptoetanole (2-ME) test, and indirect ELISA (i-ELISA) were used to detect the presence of Brucella abortusinfection in serum samples. The results showed that 4.96%, 3.54%, and 9.2% of the samples were positive for RBPT, STAT, and i-ELISA tests, respectively. The 2-ME test indicated the presence of IgG in the five serum samples. Of the thirteen positive samples in the i-ELISA test, eight cases (61.5%) were more than five years old, and the remaining five cases (38.5%) were under five years old. Out of thirteen positive cases, four cases (30.8%) were females, and nine cases (69.2%) were males. No significant relationship was found between Brucella abortus-infected cases and the age and gender of the horses. The findings suggest the presence of Brucella abortus contamination in native horses in the study area, emphasizing the importance of considering these animals in control and eradication programs for Brucellosis in the region. © 2024, University of Tabriz.

ABSTRACT: Adult horses are susceptible to equine coronavirus (ECoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), although, only ECoV has been linked to clinical disease. Little information is available regarding the seroprevalence against ECoV and SARS-CoV-2 in adult healthy horses. The goal of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence against two coronaviruses known to infect horses using convenience samples collected from horses recently imported from Europe to the United States from 2019 to 2023. A total of 385 banked serum samples were tested against ECoV and SARS-CoV-2 using previously validated ELISA assays. Prevalence factors including date of arrival in the United States, signalment and country of origin were available for the majority of the horses. A total of 9/385 (2.3%) and 4/385 (1.0%) horses tested seropositive for ECoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The ECoV seropositive horses were all mares, ages 4 to 26 years (median 9 years) and originated from Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium and Italy. These mares were predominantly imported during the summer and fall months. All SARS-CoV-2 seropositive horses were mares ages 5 to 10 years (median 7.5 years) imported from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The majority of the SARS-CoV-2 seropositive horses were imported during the colder months of the year. The study results support the presence of ECoV in Europe and report on the first SARS-CoV-2 seropositive healthy adult horses outside the United States. Commingling for movements by air and close contact to humans may predispose transmission with ECoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Despite its proven research applications, it remains unknown whether surface electromyography (sEMG) can be used clinically to discriminate non-lame from lame conditions in horses. This study compared the classification performance of sEMG absolute value (sEMGabs) and asymmetry (sEMGasym) parameters, alongside validated kinematic upper-body asymmetry parameters, for distinguishing non-lame from induced fore- (iFL) and hindlimb (iHL) lameness. Bilateral sEMG and 3D-kinematic data were collected from clinically non-lame horses (n = 8) during in-hand trot. iFL and iHL (2–3/5 AAEP) were induced on separate days using a modified horseshoe, with baseline data initially collected each day. sEMG signals were DC-offset removed, high-pass filtered (40 Hz), and full-wave rectified. Normalized, average rectified value (ARV) was calculated for each muscle and stride (sEMGabs), with the difference between right and left-side ARV representing sEMGasym. Asymmetry parameters (MinDiff, MaxDiff, Hip Hike) were calculated from poll, withers, and pelvis vertical displacement. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis determined the accuracy of each parameter for distinguishing baseline from iFL or iHL. Both sEMG parameters performed better for detecting iHL (0.97 ≥ AUC ≥ 0.48) compared to iFL (0.77 ≥ AUC ≥ 0.49). sEMGabs performed better (0.97 ≥ AUC ≥ 0.49) than sEMGasym (0.76 ≥ AUC ≥ 0.48) for detecting both iFL and iHL. Like previous studies, MinDiff Poll and Pelvis asymmetry parameters (MinDiff, MaxDiff, Hip Hike) demonstrated excellent discrimination for iFL and iHL, respectively (AUC > 0.95). Findings support future development of multivariate lameness-detection approaches that combine kinematics and sEMG. This may provide a more comprehensive approach to diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of equine lameness, by measuring the underlying functional cause(s) at a neuromuscular level.

ABSTRACT: Background: The outcome of conservative treatment for subchondral cystic lesions (SCLs) of the distal phalanx may be poor, and surgical approach through the hoof may be challenging. Objectives: To describe the use of an absorbable device to treat SCLs of the distal phalanx, regardless of cyst location, that eliminates lameness and stimulates bone healing in both young and mature horses. Study design: Clinical case series. Methods: Five young horses and five mature horses presented with an SCL of the distal phalanx causing lameness. Only rest and medical treatment were previously attempted. An absorbable screw was inserted in all horses after transcortical debridement of the SCL. Follow-up data were obtained from the official electronic database. Results: All horses returned to athletic activity after surgical treatment. In two patients, surgical complication was recorded. Main limitations: The low number of patients, the need for dedicated instruments and the lack of familiarity with the use of absorbable devices to perform surgical procedures. Conclusions: The insertion of an absorbable device can be considered a valid surgical option for treating subchondral cystic lesions of the distal phalanx. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Few studies have associated horse skin temperature with the thermal environment, physiology and exercise. This study aimed to use infrared thermography to analyze thermoregulation in horses during training and the efficiency of bathing time in restoring normal physiological conditions. A completely randomized design was used, with 2 treatments and 6 replications. The treatments were different bathing times, after exercise: BE – Before exercise (Control – resting animal); T2 – 2-minute shower, after exercise; T5 – 5-minute shower, after exercise. Six Brazilian Sport (BH) and six Thoroughbred (TB) horses were studied, with average age and weight of 8.5 years and 415 kg respectively, ridden over a classic showjumping course for 50 minutes. The variables were collected from 13h00 to 15h00 over 3 nonconsecutive days, before jump training, prior to bathing (post-training) and after bathing. The environmental variables (wet bulb temperature, black globe temperature, relative air humidity and dry bulb temperature) were determined in the external (track) and internal (bathroom) environments. Thermal comfort indexes were calculated: Temperature and Humidity Index (THI), Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index (BGHI). Were collected the rectal temperature, respiratory rate and body surface temperature. A significant effect was observed for the rectal temperature, respiratory rate and surface temperature (P<0.05) between the pre- and post-training and before and after bathing. Training for around 50 minutes increased respiratory rate as well as rectal and skin temperatures. Bathing times of 2 or 5 minutes promote equivalent reductions in the animals’ respiratory rate and skin temperatures, reaching values below those observed before training. The rectal temperature of the animals remained high even after bathing, indicating delayed recovery in relation to the other variables. © 2024 Universidade Estadual de Londrina. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The way horses are trained has implications for equine welfare and training success, yet little is known about the factors that influence horse-owners’ choice of training approach (TA). Limited understanding in area will likely hinder the development and dissemination of evidence-based training advice to owners. Consequently, this study aims to identify demographic and attitudinal factors that influence horse-owner TA selection. A 22-question online survey collected information from 1,593 horse-owners about their demographics, equestrian activities, goals and beliefs. Participants rated how likely they were to use six different horse TAs on a five-point scale. Multinomial regression analysis and Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used to identify factors associated with their likelihood of using each TA. Several factors were associated with reported TA use, including age, gender identity, goals, activities, industry role and whether they had training in animal behavior. Beliefs about equine sentience, cognitive ability and whether science should inform horse training correlated with likelihood of applying aversives. This study provides insight for further research and development of educational strategies to reduce the use of training approaches that may compromise equine welfare. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Bisphosphonates are widely used in equine athletes to reduce lameness associated with skeletal disorders. Widespread off-label use has led to concern regarding potential negative effects on bone healing, but little evidence exists to support or refute this. Objectives: To investigate the influence of clinically relevant doses of tiludronate on bone remodelling and bone healing. Study design: Randomised, controlled in vivo experiments. Methods: Each horse had a single tuber coxae biopsied (Day 0), then were divided into a treatment (IV tiludronate) or control (IV saline) group. Treatments were administered 30 and 90 days following initial biopsy. Biopsy of the tuber coxae was repeated on Day 60 to evaluate bone healing following a single treatment. Oxytetracycline was administered on Days 137 and 147 to label bone formation. The contralateral tuber coxae was biopsied on Day 150 to evaluate effects of repeated treatment. Bone biopsies were evaluated with micro-computed tomography and/or dynamic histomorphometry using standard techniques. Results: Nineteen horses completed the study, with no complications following the biopsies and treatments. No significant differences in the trabecular bone parameters or bone formation rate were observed between treatment groups. Main limitations: The use of a first-generation bisphosphonate may mean some effects of these drugs are underrepresented using this model. The results pertain to the tuber coxae and may not reflect injury or the healing response that occurs in long bones in training or racing. Conclusions: In this model, tiludronate did not affect normal bone remodelling in the horse, despite repeat dosages. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Human–horse relationships can be experienced in many ways and the horse companion can be given various roles, from a partner in action to a tool or commodity. How humans experience connection with horses and what kinds of roles are assigned to them may reflect or even depend on the real-life co-actions and environments. In this study, we assessed experiences of intersubjectivity in human–horse relationships, focusing particularly on whether and how agency and emotional and embodied intersubjectivity with the horse were discussed by horse owners. We conducted the study in two different stable environments, namely box stables and open-shed stables, that differ particularly in the horses’ possibilities to execute independent decision-making in their daily lives. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 25 horse owners and analyzed them using theory-guided qualitative content analysis for notions of agency and intersubjectivity. Overall, while there were only a few explicit accounts of embodied intersubjectivity in action, it was most explicitly apparent in descriptions of hacking and doing other things than riding. Additionally, intersubjectivity was apparent in descriptions of horse emotions. There were several differences in the horse owners’ accounts at the different stable environments. Respondents at the open-shed stables assigned agency more often to the horse or simultaneously themselves and the horse, discussed more often horse emotions, and emphasized hacking, playing, or just being with the horse as meaningful co-actions. At the box stables, accounts emphasizing competing, self-evidence of riding as the main activity, and human agency in co-action were more common. These results show that the management environment and forms of co-action are connected to the thoughts and views equestrians have on agency and experiences of intersubjectivity in horse–human relationships. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Bardigiano horse is a traditional native Italian breed with a rich history and peculiar characteristics. Local breeds are proven to have unique genetic traits developed over generations to adapt to defined geographical regions and/or conditions. The specific microbial communities that coexist within these animals are unraveled by studying their microbiota, which permits a further step in the characterization of local heritage. This work aimed to characterize Bardigiano horse fecal microbiota composition. The data obtained were then compared with published data of a mix of athlete breeds to evaluate potential differences among local and specialized breeds. The study involved 11 Bardigiano mares between 3 and 4 years of age, from which stool was sampled for the study. Samples were processed for 16S rRNA sequencing. Data obtained were analyzed and plotted using R, RStudio, and FastTree software. The samples analyzed were similar to what literature has reported on horses of other breeds and attitudes at higher taxonomic levels (from phylum to genera). While at lower taxonomic levels, the difference was more marked highlighting specific families found in the Bardigiano breed only. Weight, province of origin, and breeding sites significantly affected microbiota composition (p-value ≤0.02, p-value ≤0.04, and p-value ≤0.05, respectively). The comparison with athlete breed showed a significant difference confirming that animal and environmental factors are crucial in determining fecal microbiota composition (p-value <0.001). Understanding the microbiota composition in local breeds like the Bardigiano horse is crucial for preserving biodiversity, managing animal health, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is a major cause of abortion and respiratory disease. Equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4), on the other hand, is exclusively associated with respiratory disease in horse populations worldwide, particularly in Egypt and Arabian countries. Aim: This study aims to investigate the circulation of EHV-1 and EHV-4 in the Arabian horse population through molecular detection and genetic characterization of EHV-1 and/or EHV-4 that may threaten the stability of horse industry. Methods: A total of 80 samples including 50 nasal swabs, 10 vaginal swabs and 20 whole blood samples were collected from vaccinated and registered pure-bred Arabian adult horses from different studs in the governorates of northern Egypt (Cairo, Dakahlyia and Qalyubia) from 2021 to 2022. The collected samples were screened using consensus PCR for detection of EHVs using specific primers targeting DNA polymerase gene. The positive samples were subjected to conventional PCR for detection of EHV-1 and/or EHV-4using specific primers targeting glycoprotein (gB) gene. EHV-1 and EHV-4 amplicons were partially sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed using Sanger method. Results: Consensus PCR revealed that 48 out of 80 samples were positive for EHVs with percentage of 60%. Typing of the selected positive samples using conventional PCR showed that 29 out of 80 were positive for EHV-1 with percentage 36.25%, while 24 out of 80 samples were positive for EHV-4 with percentage 30%. Mixed infections with both viruses were detected in five samples. The amplified products were sequenced using Sanger method and submitted to GenBank under accession number OM362231MG-1 for EHV-1 strain and OM362232 MG-4 for EHV-4 strain. Sequence analysis and alignments of the amplified fragments of the EHV-1 and EHV-4 glycoprotein B (gB) gene to that of GenBank-derived reference strains revealed a high degree of similarity. According to the phylogenetic tree, the obtained sequences of EHV-1 and 4 in the current study showed homogeneity with local Egyptian and foreign EHV-1 and 4 strains and heterogeneity with EHV-2 and 5. Conclusion: The current investigation showed that molecular methods are appropriate assays for an efficient and accurate diagnosis of EHVs. Furthermore, it supports earlier research findings about the prevalence of EHV-1 and 4 in Arabian horse populations in Egypt. © 2024, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Benzylpenicillin (BP) is a first-line antibiotic in horses but there are discrepancies between manufacturers and literature recommendations regarding dosing regimen. Objectives of this study were to evaluate pharmacokinetics and local tolerance of four different formulations of BP in adult horses, and to suggest optimized dosing regimen according to the formulation. Methods: A cross-over design was used in 3 phases for the intramuscular injection of three different products: procaine BP alone, procaine BP/ benzathine BP combination or penethamate hydriodide were administered IM in the gluteal muscles of 6 horses for 3 days. Single IV administration of sodium BP was performed to the same horses with a dose of 22,000 IU BP/kg bwt 39 weeks after last IM injection. BP plasma concentrations were determined by UPLC assay coupled with mass spectrometry and a PK/PD analysis was conducted to predict the efficacy of various dosing regimens by estimating values of the fT>MIC index for different minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Tolerance at the site of IM injection was monitored by creatine kinase activity quantified with a validated chemistry system and clinical scorings. Results and discussion: Except one neurological reaction following one administration of penethamate hydriodide, the tolerance was good. Procaine BP alone, procaine BP/benzathine BP combination or penethamate hydriodide intramuscular administrations at a dosage of 22,000 IU BP/kg bwt q24h for 5 days would yield plasma concentrations that should be effective against bacteria with MIC of ≤0.256, 0.125 or 0.064 mg/L respectively. Of all the tested treatments, the use of a sodium BP by IV Constant Rate Infusion (CRI) for 10 hours a day was deemed to be the most efficient. All the formulations tested in this study are adequate to treat infections with susceptible Streptococcus equi.

ABSTRACT: Background: Mesenchymal stem cells provide a valuable treatment option in orthopedic injuries in horses. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the hematological, biochemical, immunological and immunomodulatory parameters following intralesional treatment with tenogenic primed equine allogeneic peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (tpMSCs) in client-owned horses with naturally occurring superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL) injuries. Methods: The immunogenicity and immunomodulatory capacities of tpMSCs were assessed in a modified mixed lymphocyte reaction, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 14 horses with SDFT and SL injuries after treatment with tpMSCs. In a second study, 18 horses with SDFT and SL injuries received either an intralesional injection with tpMSCs (n = 9) or no treatment (n = 9). Results: The tpMSCs did not provoke a cellular immune response (p < 0.001) and were able to immunomodulate stimulated T lymphocytes (p < 0.001) in vitro. Therapeutic use of tpMSCs did not result in relevant hematologic or biochemical abnormalities. Main limitations: Both studies had a small sample size. No statistical analyses were performed in the second study. Fibrinogen was only analyzed in a single horse prior to treatment. Conclusion: Co-incubation of tpMSCs and PBMCs of horses that have been previously exposed to tpMSCs did not elicit a cellular immune response and tpMSCs were able to immunomodulate stimulated T lymphocytes. Intralesional treatment with tpMSCs did not provoke abnormal changes in hematological and biochemical parameters. Copyright © 2024 Carlier, Depuydt, Van Hecke, Martens, Saunders and Spaas.

ABSTRACT: Background: The resistivity index (RI) evaluates haemodynamic based on arterial resistance. Alterations in renal blood flow are important for the early detection of kidney damage, as perfusion might be one of the first affected aspects. Objectives: To retrieve published studies on equine renal RI to develop a standardised method of renal ultrasonographic examination and to evaluate the current reference range for the renal RI in horses. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: An electronic search in Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was performed in February 2023 using the terms ‘RI’ OR ‘resistivity index’ OR ‘IP’ OR ‘pulsatility index’ AND (kidney OR renal) AND (equine OR horse) in titles, keywords and abstracts. The studies were screened for inclusion based on pre-determined criteria and data on the variables of interest were collected from included studies. The SYRCLE risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results: The electronic searches identified 134 studies, of which 5 were eligible for inclusion in this review. The studies had been conducted in healthy non-sedated horses through the transabdominal technique. The upper limit of normality for the renal RI was 0.58 ± 0.06 for the right kidney of untrained horses, which is considerably lower than the value of 0.70 currently used for humans, cats and dogs. There were heterogenous outcomes among the studies: two of the five demonstrated a difference between the right and left renal RI values, and one of the five showed an increased renal RI in elderly horses compared with foals and adult horses. Main limitations: Data regarding the RI in horses are still scarce. Conclusions: Additional studies that establish a reference range for the renal RI in horses are needed and there is a need to ensure consistency of techniques. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: A screening ultrasonographic examination of yearling Thoroughbred horses has been described which can be performed on farm, as an adjunct to pre-sale yearling radiography. Objectives: To compare ultrasonographic and radiographic findings in young Thoroughbred horses in the detection of osteochondrosis. Study design: Descriptive and comparative study using ultrasonography and radiography. Methods: Forty-four horses with a mean age of 10 months underwent an ultrasonographic screening protocol of joint groups including the bilateral stifle, tarsal, carpal and metacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal joints. Concurrent standardised radiographic projections of all the joints were also undertaken. A cohort of 26 of these horses had a second set of radiographs taken for yearling sales approximately 6 months later. Two reviewers reviewed all images for presence or absence of osteochondrosis lesions. Comparison of the ultrasonographic and radiographic findings was undertaken using Gwet's AC1 and the Landis and Kock scale. Results: The principal observer identified 48 ultrasonographic lesions and 15 radiographic lesions on the initial examination. Overall, there was agreement in screening for osteochondrosis using ultrasonographic and radiographic lesions, however, with varying levels of agreement for different joint groups. Agreement for individual joint groups was almost perfect for the carpal (0.98) and metatarsophalangeal joints (0.81), substantial for the stifle joints (0.67), moderate for the metacarpophalangeal joint (0.59) with only fair agreement of the tarsal joints (0.30). Six osteochondral lesions were recorded on the second set of radiographs. There was overall substantial agreement between the ultrasonographic findings and the second set of radiographs. A second observer reviewed the ultrasonographic and radiographic images. There was moderate interobserver agreement comparing ultrasonographic images, and almost perfect interobserver agreement comparing radiographic images. Main limitations: Small number of horses who presented for yearling sale radiography for comparison. One ultrasonographer acquired all images, and two observers reviewed the images. Conclusion: Ultrasonographic screening of yearling horses with a relatively low number of lesions showed agreement with concurrent and yearling sale radiographs. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Considering the difficulties in wound healing in horses, the possibility of using a biocompatible adhesive for wound suturing presents itself as an asset for equine surgery. The tissue adhesive, which is composed of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate, offered advantages when used in human wounds, such as the absence of discomfort, reduction of surgical and healing time, a physical barrier against environmental infectious agents, resistance to exudates, and reduction of dehiscence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and biocompatibility of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate as a skin adhesive in equine surgical wounds and to compare it with the use of sutures in the healing process. Materials, Methods & Results: A total of 8 horses in 2 experimental stages, neck and croup, were used and divided into 2 groups at each stage. On both sides of the neck, 7-cm-long skin incisions were made, which were sutured with nylon thread (SG; suture group; left side of neck) or glued with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (AG; tissue adhesive group; right side of neck). The same procedure was performed on both sides of the croup of these animals, the left side being SG and the right side, AG. Macroscopic assessments of the surgical wounds of both groups were performed on days 1 (D1), 3 (D3), 7 (D7), 10 (D10), and 12 (D12) after surgery with standardized photographs regarding spacing and position. Animals with 70% to 100% dehiscence of the wound, i.e., with a length of more than 4.9 cm, were considered as total dehiscence and excluded from the evaluations. Aspects such as touch sensitivity, tissue consistency, volume increase and temperature, healing process, and signs of biomaterial rejection were observed. On the twelfth day after surgery (D12), a fragment of healed skin was harvested for microscopic evaluation. Tissue adhesive was considered a faster and easier method compared to SG, with advantages such as barrier function against microorganisms and the fact that it does not need to be removed. However, the major disadvantage was the high rate of dehiscence. Histopathological analysis showed a greater inflammatory infiltrate at SG, suggesting a reaction to the presence of the adhesive, in addition to being a more aggressive method of synthesis. Discussion: Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate proved to be easy and quick to apply, with the time required for synthesis being significantly shorter compared with suturing, and caused no discomfort during the transoperative period. However, it was difficult to apply in cases of heavy bleeding because the product polymerized rapidly on contact with blood, which promoted good hemostasis but led to unsatisfactory synthesis of the wound, which may have contributed to its subsequent dehiscence. There was a significant difference between the studied groups in the presence of dehiscence, as the SG had no dehiscence compared with 50% of dehiscence in the AG as a whole (n = 16), with 37.5% considered total dehiscence and 12.5% partial wound dehiscence. One possible explanation is the high tensile force in the region, possibly due to excessive movement of the wound site, combined with the wound size of 7 cm, which is probably too large for the use of tissue adhesive alone, without deep relaxing sutures. In the present study, skin samples taken on day 12 from each group were examined. The results show that there was a greater amount of inflammatory cells in the SG than in the AG. The presence of the nylon thread as a foreign body and the greater aggressiveness in performing the suture may contribute to prolonging the inflammatory phases of the tissue repair process, as was found in this group. It was also possible to observe a greater amount of tissue reaction around the area of the AG scar, i.e. perivascular and periglandular (sebaceous and sweat glands), indicating contact dermatitis due to the presence of tissue glue. © 2024 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ABSTRACT: Horses are herd animals and in the feral state live in small family groups, which historically were thought to have a clearly defined hierarchy. The individually stabled horse can be denied the social interactions, and this may contribute to the development of abnormal behaviours such as box walking, weaving, cribbiting and wind-sucking. Biting and kicking, or threatening to do so, are the horse’s main ways of showing aggression. Heritability, management, feeding practices, social contact, crowding and many more have all been suggested as being responsible for their development or have been shown to increase the risk of them happening. Being prey animals, signs of pain and distress can be very subtle in horses. Welfare scales can be a useful way of assessing and monitoring the severity of pain. Horses are frequently used in behavioural studies, in reproductive physiology, pharmaceutical, infectious diseases and nutritional research. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Sagittal groove disease of the proximal phalanx in equine athletes is commonly considered a bone stress injury. Repetitive hyperextension of the fetlock under high load is thought to contribute to its development. Concurrent changes are often reported in the dorsal sagittal ridge of the third metacarpus/metatarsus (MC3/MT3). Objectives: To describe the spectrum of associated osseous abnormalities that are present in the fetlock in a large group of horses diagnosed with sagittal groove disease on low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design: Retrospective, cross-sectional. Methods: MRI images of horses diagnosed with sagittal groove disease at Equitom Equine Clinic between March 2014 and March 2023 were evaluated using semi-quantitative grading schemes and a sagittal groove disease MRI classification system. Results: MRIs of 132 limbs were evaluated, predominantly from warmbloods used for showjumping (n = 83) and dressage (n = 18). Osseous densification and bone oedema-like signal grades were higher in the dorsal sagittal ridge than palmarly/plantarly (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Grades of both osseous densification and bone oedema-like signal in the dorsal sagittal ridge did not significantly differ between the different sagittal groove disease MRI classifications (both p > 0.05). Main limitations: Inclusion based on original MRI reports, absence of control group, small numbers within some grading groups hindering statistical analyses. Conclusions: Findings support the aetiological theories of chronic bone-stress due to loaded fetlock hyperextension however the severity of osseous changes of the dorsal sagittal ridge does not appear to be associated with the severity of sagittal groove disease classification. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of cannabinoids and their metabolites were determined in eight horses after enteral administration of a commercial CBD/CBDA-rich hemp oil product. Each horse was administered 2 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg CBD/CBDA or no treatment in a randomized cross-over design. Serial serum samples collected over 48 h were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma chemistry analysis was performed at 0 h and 24 h. Vital parameters, pedometry, and blinded mentation and gait evaluations were recorded at intervals up to 24 h. Manure production and gastrointestinal transit time were tracked for 48 h after oil administration. The median maximal concentration of CBD and CBDA were 5.2 and 36.95 ng/mL in the 2 mg/kg group, respectively; and 40.35 and 353.56 ng/mL in the 8 mg/kg group. The median half-life of elimination was not calculated for the 2 mg/kg CBD treatment due to lack of time points above the lower quantifiable limit beyond the Cmax while it was 7.75 h in the 8 mg/kg group. CBDA absorption was biphasic. Pharmacokinetic parameters for tetrahydrocannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, cannabigerolic acid, and 7-carboxy cannabidiol are also reported. No significant differences in any of the measured tolerability parameters were demonstrated between treatment groups. Single-dose enteral administration of CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract up to 8 mg/kg does not appear to produce neurologic, behavioral, or gastrointestinal effects in horses.

ABSTRACT: Background: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) occurs sporadically and can impair athletic performance. Gold standard for diagnosis is surface electrocardiography (ECG), however, this requires AF to be sustained. Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are routinely used for AF detection in human medicine. While ILR placement has been studied in horses, its AF detection performance is unknown. Objectives: (I) Validation of ILRs for AF detection in horses. (II) Determining pAF incidence using ILRs and estimate the positive predictive value (PPV). Study design: (I) Experimental study; (II) Longitudinal observational study. Methods: (I) Implantation of ILRs in 15 horses with AF and 13 horses in sinus rhythm. Holter ECGs were recorded at: 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of AF. The ILR ECGs were compared with surface ECGs to assess diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. (II) Eighty horses (43 Warmbloods, 37 Standardbreds) with ILRs were monitored for 367 days [IQR 208–621]. Results: (I) ILRs detected AF on all recording days, in horses with AF, with a sensitivity of 66.1% (95% CI: 65.8–66.5) and a specificity of 99.99% (95% CI: 99.97–99.99). The sensitivity remained consistent across all time points. (II) The incidence of pAF was 6.3% (5/80). In horses with pAF, the PPV ranged from 8% to 87%. Increased body condition score (BCS > 6/9) was associated with an increased number of false positive episodes (p = 0.005). Main limitations: (I) Horses were stabled during the ECG recordings, and AF was induced, rather than naturally occurring pAF. (II) Integrated algorithm in this ILR is optimised for AF detection in humans using remote monitors. Additionally, sensing is affected by motion artefacts. Conclusion: The ILR reliably detected AF in resting horses, particularly in horses with normal BCS (6/9). The ILR proved useful to detect pAF and is recommended alongside Holter monitoring for diagnostic workup of horses with suspected pAF. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Addition of morphine to the perfusate while performing intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) may be helpful in treating painful infectious orthopaedic conditions of the distal limb. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to determine synovial morphine concentrations following IVRLP with morphine alone or in combination with amikacin. Study design: Randomised cross-over in vivo experiment. Methods: Six horses underwent IVRLP with 0.1 mg/kg morphine sulphate diluted to 60 mL using 0.9% NaCl (M group) or combined with 2 g amikacin and 0.9% NaCl (MA group) with a 2-week washout period between treatments. Synovial fluid was collected from the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) at 10, 20, 30, 120, 240, 480, 720 and 1440 min after IVRLP. The tourniquet was removed after the 30-min sample was collected. Synovial concentrations of morphine and major metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Amikacin concentrations were quantified by a fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. Results: Measurable concentrations of morphine were apparent in the RCJ of all horses. Median CMAX of morphine in the M group was 4753.1 (2115.7–14 934.5) ng/mL and 4477 (3434.3–7363) ng/mL in the MA group (p = 0.5). Median CMAX of synovial amikacin was 322.6 (157.5–1371.6 μg/mL). Main limitations: Limitations include small sample size. Investigators were not blinded to the treatments and a third treatment group where amikacin alone was administered via IVRLP to the study population was not included. Conclusions: IVRLP using morphine is a feasible technique and synovial morphine concentrations were measurable following IVRLP and were not affected when used concurrently with amikacin. Administration of morphine via IVRLP may be beneficial as an analgesic technique for orthopaedic conditions of the distal limb while limiting potential serious systemic side-effects. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Equine testicular arteritis commonly occurs as a consequence of the migration of nematode larvae or equine arteritis virus (EAV) infection. However, testicular arteritis without evidence of these infections has been reported, and the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. We encountered testicular arteritis without evidence of nematode or EAV infection in a 3-year-old male heavy draft horse with scrotal enlargement. Grossly, the volume of the pampiniform plexus was markedly increased due to edema. Histologically, non-suppurative and necrotizing testicular arteritis, characterized by lymphocyte infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis of the arterial walls, was diffusely observed in the spermatic cord, pampiniform plexus (most severe), testis, and epididymis. We were unable to identify the cause of arteritis, such as a viral infection or autoimmune abnormality. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The end of gestation, ensuing parturition, and the neonatal period represent highly dynamic phases for immunological changes in both mother and offspring. The regulation of innate immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface during late term pregnancy, after birth, and during microbial colonization of the neonatal gut and other mucosal surfaces, is crucial for controlling inflammation and maintaining homeostasis. Innate immune cells and mucosal epithelial cells express antileukoproteinase (SLPI), which has anti-inflammatory and anti-protease activity that can regulate cellular activation. Methods: Here, we developed and validated new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to characterize SLPI for the first time in horses. Peripheral blood and mucosal samples were collected from healthy adults horses and a cohort of mares and their foals directly following parturition to assess this crucial stage. Results: First, we defined the cell types producing SLPI in peripheral blood by flow cytometry, highlighting the neutrophils and a subset of the CD14+ monocytes as SLPI secreting immune cells. A fluorescent bead-based assay was developed with the new SLPI mAbs and used to establish baseline concentrations for secreted SLPI in serum and secretion samples from mucosal surfaces, including saliva, nasal secretion, colostrum, and milk. This demonstrated constitutive secretion of SLPI in a variety of equine tissues, including high colostrum concentrations. Using immunofluorescence, we identified production of SLPI in mucosal tissue. Finally, longitudinal sampling of clinically healthy mares and foals allowed monitoring of serum SLPI concentrations. In neonates and postpartum mares, SLPI peaked on the day of parturition, with mares returning to the adult normal within a week and foals maintaining significantly higher SLPI secretion until three months of age. Conclusion: This demonstrated a physiological systemic change in SLPI in both mares and their foals, particularly at the time around birth, likely contributing to the regulation of innate immune responses during this critical period.

ABSTRACT: In this essay, Stephen Smith argues that what he calls a “crittercal somaticity,” comprising the capacities of breathing together, moving mimetically, and attuning somatically with other more motile beings, is exemplified in the practice of liberty play with horses. Ecosomatic scholars and practitioners of Shin Somatics help fashion this practice performatively and as a heightened sensory manner of interspecies attunement. The recovery of an inner wildness, or what might be thought of as coming to our horse senses, reverberates with what can otherwise appear as an outer wildness in creatures even of a domesticated kind. Rewilding our horse senses thereby becomes not merely a practiced somaticity of humankind but the crittercal capacity to move ever more animatedly in concert with others of a more-than-human kind. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Sondra Fraleigh & Shannon Rose Riley.

ABSTRACT: Background: Underrun heels are among the most hoof imbalances, causing poor performance in hoses. Several corrective shoeing protocols have been performed, but the outcomes have yet to be consistent. In this study, we proposed an alternative trimming protocol for managing underrun heels: strategic palmar trimming before conventional shoeing. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the potential of strategic palmar trimming before conventional shoeing for managing hoof imbalance in horses with underrun heels. Methods: Eleven affected horses were divided into control (5 horses with 14 defective hooves) and experimental (6 horses with 16 defective hooves) groups. The experimental group underwent strategic palmar trimming before conventional shoeing, while the control horses received regular trimming before traditional shoeing. Dorsal hoof wall angle (DHWA)/heel angle (HA) ratios, heel-bulb distance, and six parallel lines indicating solar surface dimension were determined before, and after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 weeks of the different trimming protocols. Palmar trimming distance was only measured in experimental horses. Results: A group-by-time interaction was observed for DHWA/HA ratios and solar surface dimension. Separate effects for group and time were observed in the heel–bulb distance. A modification in hoof conformation was detected at 25-30 weeks only in horses in the experimental group, including decreases in DHWA/HA ratio, heel–bulb distance, and palmar trimming distance, coinciding with an increase in palmar width of trimmed hooves. Conclusions: Different trimming protocols produced a different effect on hoof conformation. Therefore, tactical remedial trimming can potentially control poor hoof conformation in horses with underrun heels. Copyright: © 2024 Poochipakorn C et al.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Tick-borne pathogens (TBP) are an important group of organisms that can affect animals and humans all over the world. Equine piroplasmosis (EP), caused by Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, is considered one of the most important tick-borne diseases and can cause significant clinical symptoms and mortality in horses. Moreover, EP plays a restrictive role in international horse traditions and transportation. Although these species can cause similar symptoms, there are different 18S rRNA genotypes of T. equi (five genotypes) and B. caballi (three genotypes). Besides piroplasma species, Anaplasma and hemotropic mycoplasmas (HM) are known as other important tick-borne pathogens reported in horses. Methods: In this study, we investigated the presence, prevalence, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic analyses of TBPs using PCRs and DNA sequencing in grazing horses in Kyrgyzstan. For these purposes, a total of 311 blood samples were collected from Chuy, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Osh, Talas, and Jalal-Abad. Results: DNA amplification of TBP revealed that 23 (7.40%) out of 311 samples were found to be positive for T. equi. However, B. caballi, HM, A. phagocytophilum, and A. capra were not detected in this study. The infection rate of T. equi was higher in males (8.11%) than in females (6.35%) (p=0.2880) and in those older than 5 years (9.02%) than in the 1-4 age group (6.35%) (p=0.1950). Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA revealed that A and E genotypes of T. equi have circulated in grazing horses in Kyrgyzstan. Discussion: Information about the genetic diversity of T. equi is important for understanding the population dynamics of the species and developing effective control strategies against this pathogen. This is the first molecular investigation of A. capra in horses in Kyrgyzstan. Although this pathogen has been detected in different hosts in Kyrgyzstan, it was not detected in this study. However, considering the wide host spectrum of A. capra, it is thought that more large-scale studies are needed to understand the effect of horses on the epidemiology of this pathogen.

ABSTRACT: Theileria equi (T. equi) is an apicomplexan parasite that causes severe hemolytic anemia in equids. Presently, there is inadequate knowledge of the immune responses induced by T. equi in equid hosts impeding understanding of the host parasite relationship and development of potent vaccines for control of T. equi infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the host-parasite dynamics between T. equi merozoites and infected horses by assessing cytokine expression during primary and secondary parasite exposure, and to determine whether the pattern of expression correlated with clinical indicators of disease. Our findings showed that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was very low and inconsistent during both primary and secondary infection. There was also no correlation between the symptoms observed during primary infection and expression of the cytokines. This suggests that the symptoms might have occurred primarily due to hemolysis and likely not the undesirable effects of pro-inflammatory responses. However, IL-10 and TGF-β1 were highly expressed in both phases of infection, and their expression was linked to antibody production but not moderation of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.

ABSTRACT: Exercise plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis, which affects the diversity of the intestinal microbial community in humans and animals. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, few studies have reported the associations between horse gut microbiota along with their predicted metabolic activities and the athletic ability of Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds living in Korea. This study was conducted to investigate the association between the gut microbiota and athletic performance in horses. This study sequenced the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the partial 16S rRNA genes obtained from racehorse fecal samples and compared the fecal microbiota between high- and low-performance Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds. Forty-nine fecal samples were divided into four groups: high-performance Jeju horses (HJ, n = 13), low-performance Jeju horses (LJ, n = 17), high-performance Thoroughbreds (HT, n = 9), and low-performance Thoroughbreds (LT, n = 10). The high-performance horse groups had a higher diversity of the bacterial community than the low-performance horse groups. Two common functional metabolic activities of the hindgut microbiota (i.e., tryptophan and succinate syntheses) were observed between the low-performance horse groups, indicating dysbiosis of gut microbiota and fatigue from exercise. On the other hand, high-performance horse groups showed enriched production of polyamines, butyrate, and vitamin K. The racing performance may be associated with the composition of the intestinal microbiota of Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds in Korea.

ABSTRACT: Horses have a well-developed mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue in the naso-oropharynx for immunological defence and the development of immunological tolerance. The different components of this lymphoid tissue have been documented, but not all areas of the equine oral cavity have been investigated. In the present study, samples for histological and immunohistochemical examinations were collected from slaughtered horses of different ages, focusing on the rostral part of the oral cavity. Dense lymphatic tissue was found in the mucosa covering the bar area of the mandibles and the floor of the oral cavity, and it was present in horses of different ages. The most prominent lymphatic tissue, with large aggregates of lymph nodules, was present on either side of the lingual frenulum. The rostral location of this lymphatic tissue in horses renders support for application of antigens in allergen-specific immunotherapy via the oral mucosa. © (2024), Agricultural University of Iceland.

ABSTRACT: Feral horse management has become a subject of significant controversy in the United States, resulting in part from opposing views of best management practices and limited empirical data. Feral horse densities increase in response to high reproductive rates and limited horse removal. with this increase, land managers are challenged with accurately quantifying horse diet selection and subsequent impacts on western rangelands. To accomplish this, we obtained tail hair isotopic values from samples collected from feral horses' tails in northwestern Nevada under the oversight of the Sheldon Refuge staff and animal use protocols. Plant samples were collected from two sites on the refuges (Little Sheldon and Badger Mountain). Plant biomass, abundance, and cover were determined at random locations within the two sites. The samples were dried and ground for analysis. Tail hair samples were taken from 10 mares and 10 stallions as they were being examined by Refuge staff. Tail hairs were cleaned and cut into 5 mm sections for analysis. The mean tail hair length was 807 mm. Horse tail hair has a growth rate of 0.72 mm/day which was used to set a timeline along the length of the hair strand, the bulb at time 0 to the end, approximately 1121 days. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic values were determined through mass spectroscopy on the tail hair section and the individual forage samples. IsoSource© software was used to compare isotopic values of tail hairs to those of plant tissues. The contribution of the various plant species to the tail hair mixture values was determined using. There were no plant isotope differences between the two sites. Chronology differences (p<0.05) between mares and stallions were found. Chronology was divided into seasons and seasonal shifts were determined. Seasonal variations were noted between mares and stallions (p<0.05) and between the three years (p<0.05). The horse diet consisted of mainly grasses (~55%) and shrubs (~45%) with remainder forbs. Stallions consumed fewer forbs (5-6%) than mares (9-11%; p<0.05). Forage availability and preference are most likely linked to seasonal consumption. The difference in mare and stallion foraging patterns was clearly shown using the isotope composition in the tail hair of these free-roaming horses. Combining plant species abundance in combination with tail hair is shown to be a method that can be used to monitor foraging patterns. Increasing the knowledge base of horse diets including plant species selection and forage consumption patterns allows land managers to make informed conservation decisions. This will then reduce negative habitat impacts and improve the prediction of appropriate horse population levels that sustain healthy feral horse populations. © 2024 Megan K. Nordquist, Todd F.

ABSTRACT: The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is a well-known gold standard method for determining the aerobic capacity of athletic horses. Owing to its high cost and complex execution, there is a search for standardized exercise tests that can predict this value in a single session. One of the methods described for this purpose is the lactate minimum test (LMT), which could be more accurate despite being adequate to predict MLSS. This study aimed to examine the impact of training on the speed corresponding to lactate minimum speed (LMS) and to apply new mathematical methods to evaluate the fitness level of horses based on the curve obtained by the LMT. Ten Arabian horses underwent a 6-week training program based on LMS calculated by second-degree polynomial regression (LMSP). In addition, the LMS was also determined by visual inspection (LMSV), bi-segmented linear regression (LMSBI) and spline regression (LMSS). From the curve obtained during the LMT, it was possible to calculate angles α, β and ω, as well as the total area under the curve (AUCTOTAL) before (AUCPRELMS) and after (AUCPOSLMS) the LMS. The methods for determining the LMS were evaluated by ANOVA, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and effect size (ES) by Cohen’s d test. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the proposed LMS determination methods and other mathematical methods was also calculated. Despite showing a good correlation (ICC >0.7), the LMS determination methods differed from each other (p < 0.05), albeit without a significant difference resulting from conditioning. There were reductions in α:β ratio, angle α, and AUCPOSTLMS, with the latter indicating lower lactate accumulation in the incremental phase of LMT after conditioning, in addition to an improvement in the animals’ aerobic capacity. Considering that the most common methods for determining the LMS are applicable yet with low sensitivity for conditioning assessment, the approaches proposed herein can aid in analyzing the aerobic capacity of horses subjected to LMT. The mathematical models presented in this paper have the potential to be applied in human lactate-guided training program trials with a comparable study basis.

ABSTRACT: Although there have been advances in the technology for measuring horse body size with stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) scanners, previously reported methods with a single scanner still face a significant challenge: the time necessary for scanning is too long for the horses to remain stationary. This study attempted to scan the horse simultaneously from four directions using four scanners in order to complete the scans in a short amount of time and then combine the images from the four scans on a computer into one whole image of each horse. This study also compared body measurements from the combined 3D images with those taken from conventional manual measurements. Nine riding horses were used to construct stereoscopic composite images, and the following 10 measurements were taken: height at the withers, back, and croup; chest depth; width of the chest (WCh), croup, and waist; girth circumference, cannon circumference (CaC), and body length. The same 10 measurements were taken by conventional manual methods. Relative errors ranged from −1.89% to 7.05%. The correlation coefficient between manual and 3D measurements was significant for all body measurements (P<0.01) except for WCh and CaC. A simple regression analysis of all body measurements revealed a strong correlation (P<0.001, R2=0.9994, root-mean-square error=1.612). Simultaneous scanning with four devices from four directions reduced the scanning time from 60 sec with one device to 15 sec. This made it possible to perform non-contact body measurements even on incompletely trained horses who could not remain stationary for long periods of time. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: Horse mussel beds are listed as a Priority Marine Feature (PMF) in Scotland for their influence in the creation of diverse benthic communities and provision of ecosystem services. In Scotland, horse mussel beds are also recognised for their importance in marine carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data on horse mussel bed carbon stocks and sediment thickness. There are also significant financial and logistical barriers with which to address these data gaps. This study investigates the robustness of Sub-Bottom Profiling (SBP) as a cost-effective method to quantify horse mussel sediment thickness across a landscape. Integrating SBP and Drop-Down Video (DDV) data, this study also details an integrated approach to investigate the links between horse mussel habitat condition and sediment thickness. With the addition of abiotic data, this study uses Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to elucidate key relationships between abiotic factors, biotic variables, and sediment thickness. There is a significant positive correlation of horse mussel habitat condition and sediment thickness. Average horse mussel total sediment thickness, across all measures of habitat condition, was 1.37m. These findings substantially increase previous estimates of horse mussel sediment thickness, and potential value to climate change mitigation through blue carbon frameworks. This study highlights the importance of both abiotic and biotic factors on marine carbon sediment quantification. Copyright © 2024 Sheehy, Bates, Bell and Porter.

ABSTRACT: An adult male black horse was presented to the UOG veterinary clinic with swelling, discharge, and skin wounds on the chest wall and the right front leg; then, it goes to the lateral and medial hind leg. Inspection and palpation were carried out, and we revealed that the skin was swelled, thickened and hard on clinical examination. There was also nodule rupture, and discharge on the limb and chest skin. Different therapy was applied starting from washing the wound with water-diluted potassium permanganate and then 0.9% NaCl together with paraffin topically placed on the wound. 10% povidone-iodine was also applied by using gauze. Griseofulvin 750 mg/day for one week was given as antifungal therapy orally. The prognosis was poor due to the long incubation period and high resistance of the causative agent.  © 2024 Balemual Abebaw.

ABSTRACT: Polish Konik remains one of the most important horse breeds in Poland. The primitive, native horses with a stocky body and mouse-like coat color are protected by a conservation program, while their Polish population consists of about 3,480 individuals, representing 16 dam and six sire lines. To define the population’s genetic structure, mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome sequence variables were identified. The mtDNA whole hypervariable region analysis was carried out using the Sanger sequencing method on 233 Polish Koniks belonging to all dam lines, while the Y chromosome analysis was performed with the competitive allele-specific PCR genotyping method on 36 horses belonging to all sire lines. The analysis of the mtDNA hypervariable region detected 47 SNPs, which assigned all tested horses to 43 haplotypes. Most dam lines presented more than one haplotype; however, five dam lines were represented by only one haplotype. The haplotypes were classified into six (A, B, E, J, G, R) recognized mtDNA haplogroups, with most horses belonging to haplogroup A, common among Asian horse populations. Y chromosome analysis allocated Polish Koniks in the Crown group, condensing all modern horse breeds, and divided them into three haplotypes clustering with coldblood breeds (28 horses), warmblood breeds (two horses), and Duelmener Pony (six horses). The clustering of all Wicek sire line stallions with Duelmener horses may suggest a historical relationship between the breeds. Additionally, both mtDNA and Y chromosome sequence variability results indicate crossbreeding before the studbooks closure or irregularities in the pedigrees occurred before the DNA testing introduction.

ABSTRACT: Horse obesity is a growing concern that can result in negative welfare. The role horse owners play in horse weight management is not well understood. This study aimed to: (1) explore the attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of owners with overweight or obese horses regarding their horses’ weight; and (2) understand the motivators and barriers for owners to implement, improve and maintain weight management-related strategies. A semi-structured interview guide based on the Theoretical Domains Framework was developed. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 owners in Prince Edward Island, Canada whose horse(s) were previously classified as overweight or obese by a veterinarian. Interviews were analysed using template analysis, organising patterns in the data into a codebook and overarching themes. Owners believed horse weight management was important, however, their perceived complexity of the issue made the implementation of the weight management practices difficult. Owners held conflicting perceptions, viewing overweight horses as well cared for, yet recognised these horses were at increased risk for negative health outcomes. Ultimately, participants felt emotionally torn about compromising their horse’s mental well-being to address weight issues. Owners considered the practicality of weight-management strategies, the strategies’ effectiveness, and whether recommended strategies aligned with their beliefs regarding good horse care practices. Knowledge was embedded into owners’ understanding of horse weight, however, some highlighted that traditional knowledge dominates the equine industry hindering systemic industry change. Increased understanding of the effectiveness and impacts of weight management strategies on horses and fostering a society that recognises and accepts horses within a healthy weight range are warranted. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Trans-Canada Highway passes through very steep terrain in the Kicking Horse Canyon east of Golden, BC, and a series of recent projects have improved and widened the highway through the region. Construction of the final and most technically challenging segment is now underway with the Kicking Horse Canyon Phase 4 design build project. The existing highway crosses a series of unstable slopes, active landslides, large ravines, and avalanche and rockfall paths. Key project goals were to improve the safety of the roadway and reduce geohazard risk. The required highway geometry combined with upslope geohazards and steep terrain required significant portion of the alignment to be constructed on the steep slopes below the existing highway which have marginal stability. The conventional solution for construction on steep slopes below the highway has been to support the highway on grade with downslope retaining walls, which are stabilized by piles below. When considering this option following completion of the geotechnical investigation for detailed design, it became apparent that due to a number of factors, including higher walls and deeper bedrock than expected, large diameter piles at very tight spacing would be required to meet project specifications for slope stability. These piles would be costly, time consuming to install, and there would be significant safety challenges associated with the heavy piling equipment required on the steep slopes for long durations. A bridge solution was therefore proposed to carry the roadway on structure over the unstable slopes. An innovative viaduct design was developed and was adopted for nine individual viaduct structures totaling over 1.8 km of highway length. The viaducts have regular 23 m spans with substructures consisting of precast concrete cap beams at each pier supported on three concrete-filled steel pipe piles drilled into bedrock. The highway is supported on the structures, and the piers were designed to resist the loading from slope movements, thus avoiding the need to stabilize the entire slope. There are no established design methodologies in geotechnical practice for design of piles embedded in a moving embankment, other than in seismic design for liquefiable soils. New methodologies were developed drawing on first principles and existing stabilization pile methodologies. Close coordination was required between the structural and geotechnical engineers to find solutions for a variety of different loading situations, ground slopes and below-ground bedrock surfaces, and an active landslide zone that was actively moving during construction. Other extreme loadings were also required to be defined and designed for including debris flow, rockfall, and avalanche impacts. This paper discusses the many design, loading, and constructability challenges faced in the foundation designs. © ASCE.

ABSTRACT: Equine viral outbreaks have disrupted the socio-economic life of past human societies up until the late 19th century and continue to be of major concern to the horse industry today. With a seroprevalence of 60–80 per cent, equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) is the most common horse pathogen on the planet. Yet, its evolutionary history remains understudied. Here, we screen the sequenced data of 264 archaeological horse remains to detect the presence of EHV-4. We recover the first ancient EHV-4 genome with 4.2× average depth-of-coverage from a specimen excavated in the Southeastern Urals and dated to the Early Bronze Age period, approximately 3,900 years ago. The recovery of an EHV-4 virus outside the upper respiratory tract not only points to an animal particularly infected but also highlights the importance of post-cranial bones in pathogen characterisation. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction provides a minimal time estimate for EHV-4 diversification to around 4,000 years ago, a time when modern domestic horses spread across the Central Asian steppes together with spoke-wheeled Sintashta chariots, or earlier. The analyses also considerably revise the diversification time of the two EHV-4 subclades from the 16th century based solely on modern data to nearly a thousand years ago. Our study paves the way for a robust reconstruction of the history of non-human pathogens and their impact on animal health. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.

ABSTRACT: The effectiveness and safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can be affected by patient’s immune recognition. Thus, MSC immunogenicity and their immunomodulatory properties are crucial aspects for therapy. Immune responses after allogeneic MSC administration have been reported in different species, including equine. Interactions of allogenic MSCs with the recipient’s immune system can be influenced by factors like matching or mismatching for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) between donor-recipient, and by the levels of MHC expression in MSCs. The latter can vary upon MSC inflammatory exposure or differentiation, such as chondrogenic induction, making both priming and differentiation interesting therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the systemic in vivo immune cellular response against allogeneic equine MSCs in these situations. Either MSCs in basal conditions (MSC-naïve), pro-inflammatory primed (MSC-primed) or chondrogenically differentiated (MSC-chondro) were repeatedly administered subcutaneously into autologous, MHC-matched or MHC-mismatched allogeneic equine recipients. At different time-points after each administration, lymphocytes were obtained from recipient horses and exposed in vitro to the same type of MSCs to assess the proliferative response of different T cell subsets (cytotoxic, helper, regulatory), B cells, and interferon gamma (IFNγ) secretion. Higher proliferative response of helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes and IFNγ secretion was observed in response to all types of MHC-mismatched MSCs over MHC-matched ones. MSC-primed produced the highest immune response, followed by MSC-naïve, and MSC-chondro. However, MSC-primed activated Treg and had a mild effect on B cells, and the response after their second administration was similar to the first one. On the other hand, both MSC-chondro and MSC-naïve barely induced Treg response but promoted B lymphocyte activation, and proportionally induced a higher cell response after the second administration. In conclusion, both the type of MSC conditioning and the MHC compatibility influenced systemic immune recognition of equine MSCs after single and repeated administrations, but the response was different. Selecting MHC-matched donors would be particularly recommended for MSC-primed and repeated MSC-naïve administrations. While MHC-mismatching in MSC-chondro would be less critical, B cell response should not be ignored. Comprehensively investigating the in vivo immune response against equine allogeneic MSCs is crucial for advancing veterinary cell therapies.

ABSTRACT: Thirty horses were randomly divided into three groups and sedated with xylazine (1.1 mg/kg). General anaesthesia was induced with diazepam (0.03 mg/kg) and ketamine (2.5 mg/kg). Partial intravenous anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and constant rate infusion (CRI) consisting of xylazine 0.33 mg/kg/h and ketamine 1.5 mg/kg/h (X+K); or, higher dose of xylazine 1.2 mg/kg/h and ketamine 3.6 mg/kg/h (XX+KK); or, medetomidine 3.5 μg/kg/h (MED). Horses in each group breathed spontaneously. Heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, palpebral and corneal reflexes, rescue doses with ketamine, invasive arterial blood pressure, inspired and expired gas compositions were measured. Anaesthesia, surgery, and recoveries were timed, and recovery was scored. The xylazine with ketamine groups showed a higher respiratory rate, a significant decrease in consumption of isoflurane, and a shorter time to standing in comparison with the medetomidine group. Recovery of the lowest quality was observed in group MED and a significantly improved recovery was observed in group X+K. The CRI consisting of xylazine with ketamine was shown to be a suitable alternative to CRI with medetomidine in horses undergoing arthroscopy. © 2024, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Estra-4,9-diene-3,17-dione (dienedione) is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) available on the market as a dietary supplement for bodybuilding. It is prohibited in both human and equine sports due to its potential performance-enhancing effect. With the rare presence of the 4,9-diene configuration in endogenous steroids, dienedione has been considered as a synthetic AAS. Nevertheless, the reoccurring detection of dienedione in entire male horse urine samples led to the investigation of its possible endogenous nature in horses, and its endogenous nature in entire male horses has been recently confirmed and reported by the authors' laboratory. While dienedione is not detected in castrated horses (geldings), it is essential to study its elimination and identify its metabolites for its effective control. To study the elimination and biotransformation of dienedione, administration experiments were performed by giving three castrated horses (geldings) each single oral dose of 1500 mg of dienedione powder for seven consecutive days. The postulated in vivo metabolites included 17-hydroxyestra-4,9-dien-3-one (M1a and M1b), hydroxylated dienedione (M2a, M2b, M3a, M3b, M4, M5) and hydroxylated M1 (M6a, M6b, M7a, M7b, M8a and M8b), formed from hydroxylation and reduction of dienedione. To control the misuse of dienedione in geldings, M3a and M3b are the potential targets that gave the longest detection time, which could be detected for up to 2–5 days in urine and 0.4–4 days in plasma. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: In equine glaucoma, topical treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) is recommended. Oral acetazolamide, a systemic CAI, is used in horses with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Information regarding its effect on equine intraocular pressure (IOP) is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of oral acetazolamide treatment on IOP in horses, in a case–control study. Animals: Ten healthy horses. Procedures: Horses were treated with oral acetazolamide (4.4 mg/kg) BID for 1 week. Serum acetazolamide concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and IOP were measured before treatment, daily during treatment, and at 48 and 72 h after treatment. Results: Acetazolamide serum levels reached steady state at 72 h after the first oral dose. In a mixed effect model logistic regression, there was a significant decrease in IOP on the third treatment day, of 2.4 mmHg (p =.012) and 2.7 mmHg (p =.006) in the left (OS) and right eye (OD), respectively. On the seventh day, there was a decrease in 2.5 mmHg (p =.008) and 2.7 mmHg (p =.007) OS and OD, respectively. A significant increase occurred 48 h following treatment discontinuation (3.6 mmHg, p <.001 and 3.5 mmHg, p <.001 OS and OD, respectively). The area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC(0–10h)) was 1.1 ± 0.5 μg/mL*h, mean residence time 6.7 ± 4.3 h, peak plasma concentration (Cmax) 0.4 ± 0.4 μg/mL and time to reach Cmax 1.8 h. There was a significant increase in serum concentrations 1, 2, 48, 72, and 156 h following the first drug administration (p <.05). Conclusions: Further studies are required to determine whether acetazolamide is a potential treatment for equine glaucoma. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Horses are exquisitely sensitive to tetanus neurotoxin and are exposed to the risk of infection with Clostridium tetani throughout life. The vaccine against tetanus is highly effective at preventing disease, whereas tetanus in unvaccinated populations is associated with high mortality rates. Current guidelines in New Zealand and Australia for the available vaccine contain contradictions and limitations surrounding the optimal tetanus immunisation protocols for both adult horses and foals. This review critically evaluates the scientific literature on tetanus prophylaxis in horses within the context of equine practice and available products in New Zealand and Australia. The review was conducted by a panel of industry and specialist veterinarians to obtain agreement on nine equine tetanus prophylaxis guidelines for practising veterinarians. The primary protocol for tetanus toxoid (TT) immunisation consists of a three-dose series IM for all horses ≥ 6 months of age, and a four-dose series IM is proposed if commencing vaccination in foals between 3 and 6 months of age. Tetanus prophylaxis in foals < 3 months of age relies on passive immunity strategies. Following the completion of the primary protocol, a TT booster dose IM should be administered within 5 years, and every 5 years thereafter. When followed, these protocols should provide adequate protection against tetanus in horses. Additional tetanus prophylaxis guidelines are provided for veterinarians attending a horse experiencing a known “risk event” (e.g. wound, hoof abscess, surgery, umbilical infection). When a correctly vaccinated horse experiences a risk event, pre-existing immunity provides protection against tetanus. When an unvaccinated horse or one with unknown vaccination status, or a foal born to an unvaccinated dam, experiences a risk event, TT IM and tetanus antitoxin (TAT) 1,500 IU SC should be administered simultaneously at separate sites, and the TT primary immunisation protocol should subsequently be completed for the horse’s respective age. In previously immunised pregnant broodmares, a TT booster dose administered 4–8 weeks prior to parturition optimises the transfer of passive immunity against tetanus to the newborn foal via colostrum; provided that post-natal IgG concentration in serum is > 800 mg/dL (8 g/L), such foals should be passively protected against tetanus up to 6 months of age. Survivors of clinical tetanus must still receive the primary protocol for vaccination against tetanus. In summary, all horses in New Zealand and Australia should be vaccinated against tetanus with protection maintained throughout life via TT booster doses, facilitated by accurate medical record keeping and client education. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Drunken horse grass (Achnatherum inebrians (Hance) Keng) is a toxic perennial bunchgrass native to Northwestern China. Epichloë endophytic fungi infection could enhance the stress tolerance of drunken horse grass. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding the effects of intraspecific competition. As a result, we anticipated that the intraspecific competitive dynamics between endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) plants would become more transparent for four years by planted as the proportions of 2: 1, 1: 1, and 1: 2. The results showed the EI plants exhibited more biomass, seed yields, and survival rates than EF plants. Endophyte infection also facilitated a competitive advantage by enhancing photosynthesis and soil nutrition. Our findings constituted the inaugural investigation into the influence of the intraspecific competitive ability of grass infected with Epichloë endophyte fungi. EI plants caused them to become stronger and stronger, while EF became weaker and weaker by timing and planting proportion increasing, and EF drunken horse grass could be replaced by EI. These conclusions were instrumental in elucidating why the endophytic fungal infection rate of drunken horse grass is 100% observed in natural wilderness. Epichloë endophyte could reduce plant diversity and enhance the dominance of EI plants in intraspecific competition; drunken horse grass may be threatening the persistence of native plant species. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine farming generates a significant amount of waste, prompting the need for effective management. Composting enhanced by filamentous fungi holds promise for this purpose. This study focused on inoculating Aspergillus fumigatus isolates in composting horse bedding made with wood shavings (Pinus elliottii). The experiment lasted 90 days, with two treatment groups, control and inoculated, analyzing temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon and nitrogen content, and cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents. Both treatments entered the thermophilic phase by the fourth day, reaching temperatures above 55◦C and mesophilic maturation at 35 days (41 ± 0.2◦C). The inoculated treatment exhibited higher electrical conductivity after 30 days and a more pronounced reduction in the total carbon content (42.85% vs. 38.29%) compared to the control. While there was no significant nitrogen difference, the inoculated treatment had a sharper reduction in carbon/nitrogen ratio, and cellulose and hemicellulose contents. Both treatments showed low coliform counts, no Salmonella sp., and reduced Strongyloides sp. larvae. Inoculating A. fumigatus in saturated horse bedding made from wood shavings improved compost quality, providing a possibility for sustainable equine farming waste treatment. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The use of satellite imagery has become an integral aspect in the planning of multiple domains that include disaster management and analysis of natural calamity images, snow cover mapping, smart city development, etc. Satellite images have now become an important area in remote sensing studies. The nature inspired optimization algorithms are very promising with image segmentation techniques to provide a platform for processing of satellite images. In this paper a new satellite image segmentation method is developed using Wild Horse Optimization (WHO) to cluster the image into disjoint regions based on color information. Experiments performed on two different satellite images confirm the stability, homogeneity, and the efficiency of proposed method with comparison to K-means and Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA).  © 2024 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: A horse’s body condition impacts every aspect of its life, including reproduction, performance, and health. Obesity and equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) are common in Nigeria; hence, early identification of a horse’s obesity status by the owner is key to avoiding associated health issues such as EMS. Our study aimed to determine whether horse owners could effectively estimate their horses’ body condition scores (BCSs) and cresty neck scores (CNSs). A total of 50 adult sedentary West African Barb horses owned by 50 different people were enrolled in the study. Body condition scores (BCSs) and cresty neck scores (CNSs) were assessed on scales of 1–9 and 0–5, respectively, by an experienced veterinarian and owners. The latter had no veterinary background, received no prior education, and assessed their horses based on provided visual aids and descriptions. The BCS estimates of the experienced veterinarian and owners were slightly in agreement (k=0.209), while there was moderate agreement (k=0.547) between the CNS estimates of the experienced veterinarian and the owners. The proportion of obesity based on the experienced veterinarian’s estimation (32%) was higher than that of the owners (18%). The proportion of nuchal crest adiposity based on the experienced veterinarian’s (38%) estimation was slightly lower than that of the owners (42%). A larger proportion of the owners underestimated their horses’ BCSs and CNSs. We conclude that owners cannot effectively estimate their horses’ BCSs and CNSs. It is imperative that they are informed about the health issues associated with obesity and are taught how to effectively estimate BCS and CNS. © 2024 Japanese Society of Equine Science.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to describe the computed tomographic (CT) dimensions and the contrast attenuation of the eye in Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds. We evaluated the CT images of 10 Jeju horses and 6 Thoroughbreds without ocular abnormalities to assess the ocular dimensions and contrast attenuation. The following measurements showed significant differences between Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds (P<0.05): the diameters of the lens, globe, posterior segment, orbital fossa, and lateromedial distance of the anterior chamber; and the Hounsfield units of the vitreous body. This study describes the CT anatomical characteristics of Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds and the differences between the two breeds and provides useful information for understanding and evaluating of the eyes of Jeju horses through a CT scan. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Background: Bacterial identification can be done using various testing techniques. Molecular techniques are often used to research dangerous diseases, an approach using genetic information on the pathogenic agent. The enterohemorrhagic invasive species Escherichia coli 0157:H7 was identified from the feces of working horses on the island of Sumbawa. Another advance in molecular technology is genome amplification with qPCR which is the gold standard for detecting E. coli. Aim: This study aims to detect and identify the invasive species E. coli 0157:H7 using the gene encoding chuA with the qPCR method sourced from horse feces. Methods: Fresh fecal samples from horses on Sumbawa Island were isolated and identified, then continued with molecular examination using the gene encoding chuA using the qPCR method. Results: qPCR testing in this study showed that six sample isolates that were positive for E. coli 0157:H7 were detected for the presence of the chuA gene, which is a gene coding for an invasive species of E. coli bacteria. The highest to lowest Cq values and Tm from the qPCR results of the sample isolates were 15.98 (4KJ), 14.90 (19KG), 14.6 (3KJ), 13.77 (20KG), 12.56 (5KGB), and 12.20 (6KJ). Tm values are 86.7 (4KJ), 86.69 (3KJ), 86.56 (5KGB), 85.88 (20KGB), 85.81 (19KG), and 85.74 (6KJ). Conclusion: Validation, standardization of the development, and modification of qPCR technology must be carried out to harmonize testing throughout to avoid wrong interpretation of the test results so that the determination of actions to eradicate and control diseases originating from animals in the field does not occur. © 2024, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

ABSTRACT: Background: During electrochemotherapy (ECT), a chemotherapeutic drug is injected into the tumor and then an electroporation is provided. In horses, ear manipulation may be very painful, and combining a loco-regional technique with sedation might be a good option to avoid anesthesia-related risks. A two-injection-point block of the internal and external pinna and acoustic meatus was described in horse cadavers, and it permitted complete stain of all three branches of the great auricular nerve (GAN), internal auricular nerve branch (IAB), lateral auricular branch (LAB), and caudal auricular nerve (CAN), suggesting a lower risk of intra-parotid injection during the IAB and LAB block. Case Description: An 8-year-old Italian jumping gelding presented for ECT to treat a fibroblastic sarcoid in the left medial pinna. After intravenous sedation with acepromazine, romifidine, and butorphanol, a two-injection-point block was provided as previously described. The block of the GAN was blind, whereas an electrical nerve locator was used for the IAB, LAB, and CAN. A total of 12 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected. The ECT was safely performed without any difficulties. The horse well tolerated the procedure and completely recovered 75 minutes after sedation. No complications were detected. Conclusion: The described approach seems feasible and suitable for the blockade of the sensory innervation of the equine ear in the case of ECT. © 2024, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

ABSTRACT: Breeding manipulation season in racehorses is required to ensure the birth at the specific period (August-December), which will maximize the foal's age when participating in their first race (July). Therefore, it is important to time the mating of mares using highly accurate estrus detection methods. This research was conducted to identify the differences data using vaginal smear and pH vagina of Thorougbred crossbreed mares in estrus and anestrus phases. Fifteen multiparous mares were conducted with a period of estrus of 19-22d. The result data showed significant differences (P<0.05) in the vaginal cell distribution patterns at each phase of the estrus cycle. The superficial cells predominate (92.43±5.14%) in the estrus phase while significant parabasal cells (87.89±3.09%) predominate in the anestrus phase. The results also showed a significant difference (P<0.05) in vaginal pH which was much more alkaline (8.71±0.25) in the estrus phase while more significantly acidic-normal (6.02±0.26) in the anestrus phase. However, the results showed no difference both in vaginal smear and pH vagina based on pedigree group. Finally, the pattern of superficial cells being more common and vaginal pH levels being higher during estrus may offer a new way to find out when an equine is in estrus. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: National trotting races held in Spain between 1990–2022 were used to estimate genetic para-meters for 5 precocity criteria: age at first ranked race (AFR), age when the animal reached 50% of ranked races (A50%), age when the animal reached the first 10 ranked races (A10), total number of races in which the animal has competed before the first ranked race (NRC) and percentage of first placings/year of participation (PFP), in order to evaluate their usefulness for genetic evaluation and their possible inclusion in the Spanish Trotter Horse official genetic program. A total of 176,137 records belonging to 4947 animals were used. A Bayesian multivariate BLUP animal model showed heritability values between 0.08 (NRC) and 0.44 (A10). Medium-high genetic co-rrelations were obtained between precocity traits, ranging between −0.78 (A10-PFP) and 0.96 (A50%-A10). NRC and PFP exhibited negative correlations, with the lowest range for NRC. Additionally, a Random Regression Model (RRM) was applied to PFP to evaluate changes in performance during the animals’ sporting life. Heritability values decreased slightly up to 4 years of age (0.26–0.17), with a slight increase after the age of 5 (0.22). Genetic and permanent environmental correlations between age groups were in the high range between the nearest age groups. Variations of the expected breeding values (EBV) over the trajectory of all the age groups allowed us to differentiate robust and plastic animals (animals capable of maintaining sporting potential throughout their lives or not). Correlations between the EBV estimated with both methodologies evidenced the benefits of PFP for the early selection of performance traits in STH. Therefore, the application of an RRM for the PFP trait is recommended as it has shown acceptable heritability and adequate correlations with the rest of the precocity criteria studied. The incorporation of this trait in the breed improvement program will allow breeders to have early genetic information on animal precocity potential and ensure the inclusion of more robust individuals in their mating design. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The study was conducted to investigate the impact of different housing systems on the development of equine behavior through variations in serum cortisol concentrations. N=120 x TBP (Thoroughbred Pakistan) of three different groups (A=40 horses 2years not gelded, B= 40 age 3 years and C= 40 four years gelded) and four distinct types of housing systems. Single Housing System No Interaction (SHSNI), the horses didn’t have any interaction among them, Single Housing System Limited Interaction (SHSLI), Double Housing System (DHS), a pair of horses were kept in house and Group Housing System (GHS), where (n=40) horses were having complete interaction among them, were considered in the study. The study was conducted on Remount Depot Mona (known as Home of Horses) which is in Mandi Bahuddin, Punjab, Pakistan. The duration of study was 120 days and conducted in four phases (Phase-I SHSNI, Phase-II SHSNI, Phase- III DHS and Phase- IV GHS were used) and each phase was comprised of 30 days duration. Before shifting to any housing system, the blood was collected to measure cortisol concentration at zero day and then after every 30th day again blood was collected prior to shifting to next housing system. Blood was collected from each horse for serum cortisol analysis through Cortisol kit. Competitive Enzyme immunoassay (CEIA) was used for quantification of cortisol in samples by using commercially available cortisol ELISA kits. Analysis of variance by considering randomized complete block design was performed for statistical analysis. The cortisol concentration exhibited no significant fluctuations within the groups, but a noteworthy disparity was observed between the housing systems (P<0.05). The cortisol concentration measured at 0th day was 1.53 µg/dL which was decreased 0.58 µg/dL in SHSNI and increased 0.59 µg/dL in SHSLI reached slightly above the average value at 0th day, then it decreased (0.57 µg /dL) in DHS and again increased in GHS (0.58 µg /dL) and reached to 1.55 µg /dL. The study concludes that SHSLI is a more suitable housing system than all others, needed to be adopted for the better welfare of the horses than other housing systems. This house has maximum social interaction, less stress and stereotypes with limited injuries as compared to alternative housing systems. Further investigation can be performed to standardize that type of housing which maintains the minimum stress level of Thoroughbred horses. © 2024 University of Agriculture. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Bisphosphonates and myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) are two classes of difficult-to-detect polar drugs that are prohibited under the rules of racing. ITPP is a drug capable of increasing the amount of oxygen in hypoxic tissues, and studies have shown that administration of ITPP increases the maximal exercise capacity in mice. The properties of ITPP make it an ideal candidate as a doping agent to enhance performance in racehorses. In recent years, ITPP had indeed been detected in racehorses and confiscated items. As for bisphosphonates, it is especially critical to control their use as since February 2019, the International Agreement on Breeding, Racing and Wagering (IABRW) by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) had identified specific conditions on which bisphosphonates should not be administered to a racehorse. A recent review of literature shows that there is yet a simultaneous screening method for detecting ITPP and bisphosphonates in equine samples. This paper describes an efficient ion chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (IC-HRMS) method for the simultaneous detection of ITPP and 10 bisphosphonates at sub-parts-per-billion (ppb) to low-ppb levels in equine plasma after solid-phase extraction (SPE) and its application to an administration study of clodronic acid in horses. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Depending on intensity, physical exercise in horses causes various changes in the parameters of hematological, biochemical, acid-base, and electrolyte status, which can affect the health and athletic performance of the horse. This study’s objective was to look at how submaximal exercise at the end of the racing season affected the horses’ hematological, biochemical, acid-base, and electrolyte status markers. In this study, eight (n=8) trotters, aged 4±2 years, were involved. Venous blood samples were drawn from each horse by jugular puncture before and after exercise to determine hematologic, biochemical, acid-base and electrolyte parameters. The submaximal physical exercise in this study was two intervals of 2, 000 m of slow trotting and two consecutive runs of 500 m at submaximal level. Hematocrit (HCT), red blood cell (RBC) and monocyte count, hemoglobin (HGB) concentration, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, and glucose concentration increased significantly after the exercise. Additionally, significant decreases in venous blood pH, bicarbonate (HCO3-) and total CO2 (TCO2) concentration, base excess of the extracellular fluid (BEecf), and ionized Ca2+ (iCa2+) concentrations were established after exercise. In contrast, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), total concentration of weak acids (Atot), the anion gap (AG), and total protein and lactate concentrations were significantly higher after exercise. Considering the significant changes in the parameters of hematological, biochemical, and acid-base status after submaximal exercise, determining those parameters would be useful for monitoring the health and performance of trotters.

ABSTRACT: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato can infect horses. However, the extent to which Egyptian horses get infected and seroconvert owing to this pathogen is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi and estimate its associated risk factors. A total of 385 serum samples collected from asymptomatic horses reared in three governorates in Egypt were screened using a commercial IDEXX SNAP 4Dx Plus kit. The results revealed that 58 (15.1%) out of 385 horses had antibodies against B. burgdorferi with Giza governorate showing the highest prevalence rate (30/130; 23.1%). According to univariate logistic regression analysis, locality, age, breed of examined horses and application of hygienic measures in house were significantly associated with B. burgdorferi infection. Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression study revealed that thoroughbred horses older than four years old and raised in Giza governorate under unsanitary conditions, were more likely to be infected with B. burgdorferi than others. The serological evidence of B. burgdorferi in Egyptian horses and assessment of the risk factors associated with infection, necessitate wide range screening of this disease in other areas as well for efficient diagnosis and control. © 2024, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

ABSTRACT: In older horses, basal metabolic rate decreases, and plasma metabolite and hormone concentrations related to energy metabolism change. The occurrence of age-related diseases, which increases in old animals, may enhance inflammatory reactivity (inflammaging). Finding the appropriate treatment for inflammaging at an early stage may prevent various age-related diseases. Changes in metabolite and hormone concentrations and enzyme activities involved in energy metabolism in the plasma of clinically healthy riding horses of various ages were measured to identify biomarkers of inflammaging (persistent low-grade inflammation that occurs with aging). All horses were clinically healthy, and their body condition scores (BCSs) were 4 or 5 (9-point scale). Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (T-Cho), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), insulin concentrations, malondialdehyde (MDA), and serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations generally increased with age. Adiponectin concentrations, plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD), and leukocyte AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities decreased, while plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) remained unchanged as horses aged. Although riding horses that partake in continuous exercise seems to be less likely to develop inflammaging, horses over 17 years of age tend to show proinflammatory signs with disordered lipid metabolism. In riding horses, SAA, in combination with other markers, may be a useful biomarker for inflammaging and dysregulated lipid metabolism in aging horses. Copyright © 2024 Asahi, Arai and Tanaka.

ABSTRACT: Pythiosis is a life-threatening disease that affects various species and is prevalent in regions with high humidity. The ailment is increasingly reported globally, and in Brazil, it is an important cause of profound economic and health losses in equines. This study aimed to explore the potential of intradermal immunotherapy as both a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for pythiosis in horses from the Pantanal region of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The horses were divided into three groups: those never diagnosed with pythiosis or with lesions that could be mistaken for pythiosis (Group 1); previously infected but successfully treated horses (Group 2); and horses with a positive diagnosis for pythiosis that were under treatment (Group 3). An immunotherapeutic product (PitiumVac®) was administered intradermally. Injection site reaction and response to immunotherapy were assessed. The results indicated that intradermal immunotherapy could be a viable diagnostic and therapeutic tool, particularly in remote areas where traditional laboratory diagnosis methods are not readily accessible. The efficacy of intradermal administration was comparable to that of subcutaneous administration in treating pythiosis in horses, and the combined use of immunotherapy and triamcinolone acetonide yielded promising results for treating pythiosis in horses. However, further research is required to validate these findings. This study contributes to understanding and managing pythiosis more efficiently by providing a simple, cost-effective, and potentially efficient alternative approach to diagnosis and treatment. © 2024 Colegio Brasileiro de Patologia Animal.

ABSTRACT: Diarrhea is a common gastrointestinal disorder in horses, with diet-induced diarrhea being an emerging challenge. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbiota differences in healthy and diet-induced diarrheic horses and evaluate the effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and carbonate buffer mixture (CBM) as potential therapeutic approaches. Twenty healthy horses were included in the study, with four groups: Control, Diarrhea, CBM, and FMT. Diarrhea was induced using oligofructose, and fecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis. FMT and CBM treatments were administered orally using donor fecal matter, and formula mixture, respectively. Clinical parameters, serum levels, intestinal tissue histopathology, and fecal microbiota profiles were evaluated. The results showed that diarrhea induction disbalanced the gut microbiota with decreased diversity and richness, affected clinical parameters including elevated body temperature and diarrhea score, and decreased fecal pH, increased inflammatory responses such as increased serum LPS, IL-17A, lactic acid and total protein, and caused damage in the colon tissue. CBM and FMT treatments altered the gut microbiota composition, restoring it towards a healthier profile compared to diarrheic, restored the gut microbiota composition to healthier states, improved clinical symptoms including decreased body temperature and diarrhea score, and increased fecal pH, decreased inflammatory responses such as increased serum LPS, IL-17A, lactic acid and total protein, and repaired tissue damage. CBM and FMT Spearman correlation analysis identified specific bacterial taxa associated with host parameters and inflammation. FMT and CBM treatments showed promising therapeutic effects in managing oligofructose-induced diarrhea in horses. The findings provide valuable insights into the management and treatment of diarrhea in horses and suggest the potential of combined CBM and FMT approaches for optimal therapeutic outcomes.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horses with trigeminal-mediated headshaking (TMHS) exhibit different headshaking patterns (HSPs), electric shock-like jerking, signs of nasal irritation, and painful facial expressions. The History Rest and Exercise Score (HRE-S) was developed to objectively clarify the severity of the condition in affected horses. This score considers the history and severity of clinical signs at rest and exercise. This study aimed to assess the frequency of different clinical signs and their individual associations with diagnosis, treatment, and outcome in horses diagnosed with TMHS. The clinical records of horses presented with headshaking (HS) at the Clinic for Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, between 2006 and 2021 were assessed retrospectively for clinical signs, diagnosis, and treatment. A total of 140 horses were included in the study. Video recordings were evaluated using the HRE-S and compared to the score described by Talbot. Following discharge, owners were interviewed via telephone about the outcome. Correlations between the presence and severity of clinical signs, diagnosis, and outcome were evaluated. Results: The following clinical signs were significantly correlated with a higher HRE-S and grade by Talbot: HS at walk (independently of HSP) (52.9%, 74/140), increased total number of demonstrated HSP (independent of the dominant HSP) (more than one HSP per horse in 91.4%, 128/140), signs of nasal irritation (75.9%, 104/137), painful facial expression (67.8%, 80/118), and electric shock-like jerking (77.5%, 107/138). Diagnosis and outcome do not correlate with the presence of the above-mentioned clinical signs. Conclusion: The HRE-S was confirmed as a valid tool to evaluate disease severity in a cohort of 140 horses with HS. Additionally, clinical signs identified as indicators for higher disease severity may have a stronger negative effect on patient welfare, but they do not correlate with diagnosis or outcome.

ABSTRACT: Background: Disease outbreaks present a significant challenge to horse health and welfare and the economic stability of horse industries internationally. This is a particular concern in Ontario, Canada, where there have been frequent outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases among horses. Despite these risks, there has been limited research on whether Ontario horse owners engage in biosecurity measures sufficient to mitigate risk of equine diseases, and whether current events such as the COVID-19 pandemic influence attitudes towards equine biosecurity practices. Objective: To explore Ontario horse owners' perceptions, attitudes and experiences relating to on-farm biosecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design: Qualitative study using virtual semi-structured interviews. Methods: Participants (horse owners, frequent horse riders and part boarders) were recruited using social media snowball sampling where advertisements were shared by equine and veterinary organisations. Interviews were conducted virtually between June and September 2022 and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Three key themes relating to biosecurity perceptions among the 14 participants were identified. Participants relied on minimal preventative measures (such as vaccines) where perceived risk of disease was low, but implemented additional measures including quarantine and handwashing when perceived risk of disease was high. Participants' choice of biosecurity practices often mirrored those recommended by the barn manager. Moreover, participants felt that responsibility for biosecurity was not shared equally across horse owners, with more emphasis placed on those engaging in high-risk situations for disease spread. Despite experiencing biosecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, horse owners were not consistently applying these practices to their horse care routines. Main limitations: The perspectives reported here are from a small sample of horse owners and may not be generalisable to all populations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that horse owners need improved access to and engagement with educational initiatives that emphasise the importance and purpose of all biosecurity measures. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Gene doping is prohibited in horse sports and can involve the administration of exogenous genes, called transgenes, to postnatal animals. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods have been developed to detect gene doping; however, these generally require DNA extraction from the plasma prior to qPCR. In this study, we developed two methods, direct droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and nested ddPCR, to detect the equine erythropoietin (EPO) transgene without DNA extraction. Direct ddPCR used pretreated plasma and PCR to detect the EPO transgene spiked at 10 copies/μL. Nested ddPCR utilised pre-amplification using nontreated plasma, purification of PCR products and PCR to detect the EPO transgene spiked at 1 copy/μL in plasma. These methods successfully detected the EPO transgene after intramuscular injection into horses. Since each method has different detection sensitivity, the combined use of direct ddPCR for screening and nested ddPCR for confirmation may complement each other and prevent the occurrence of false positives, allowing the reliable detection of gene-doped substances. One advantage of these methods is the small amount of sample required, approximately 2.2–5.0 μl, owing to the lack of a DNA extraction step. Therefore, these tests could be applied to small volume samples as an alternative to conventional gene doping tests. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The objective of the study was to define the nature of growth and to establish the standards of growth in Marwari, Manipuri and Zanskari horses. Mathematical functions for the prediction of growth in Marwari horses were derived utilising 1112 records of body weight. The body weight standards of Marwari horses from birth to 11 ½ years of age were defined and found to be close to that of Arabian horses. The Logarithmic, Power, S and Cubic functions were derived with respective R2 values of 0.955, 0.833, 0.897 and 0.980 for average body weights to explain the age-weight relationship in Marwari horses from birth to 11 ½ years of age. Looking at the distribution of observed data along the course of predicted curve and goodness of fit on average body weight, the Cubic equation Ŷ = 68.136 + 10.744 (x) - 0.12189 (x)2 + 0.00044177 (x)3 can reliably be utilized for prediction of body weight with respect to age. Similarly, the Cubic equations with R2 value of 0.965 and 0.958 were derived respectively for Manipuri and Zanskari horses. The two roots of Cubic function were derived to define the points of inflection of growth curve. The study indicated that the initial growth phase in Marwari, Manipuri and Zanskari continues up to the age of 73.22, 72 and 67.4 months respectively and there after it remains static; and the cubic function can reliably be used to explain the nature of growth in Marwari, Manipuri and Zanskari breeds of horses. © 2024 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

ABSTRACT: The main task of the meat processing industry is to produce meat products as the primary source of animal protein that ensures the vital activity of the human body in the necessary volumes, high quality, and a diverse assortment. Providing the population with high-quality food products that are biologically complete, balanced in the composition of the primary nutrients, and enriched with target physiologically active components is one of the most priority scientific and technical problems to be solved. In this regard, a recipe for a new brine from sprouted grains for delicatessen products from horse meat, beef, and pork was developed. The composition of the new brine includes flavoring and aromatic ingredients, juice of sprouted grains, and juices of raw vegetable materials. The viscosity of horse meat, beef, and pork during massaging was studied. Thermodynamic parameters such as water activity and moisture binding energy of horse meat, beef, and pork using a new brine were studied. The data analysis shows that the values of the “aw” indicator and the moisture binding energy in the experimental samples of meat products are higher than in the control samples. Studies have found that with an increase in the activity of water and the moisture binding energy, the tenderness of finished delicatessen meat products with a new brine increases. As a result, it was found that the maximum amount of brine in horse meat is retained at 160 minutes of continuous massaging, in beef – at 130 minutes, in pork – at 120 minutes of mechanical processing. © 2024 Authors, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

ABSTRACT: Background: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used in humans and animals, which is very important for health. TCM affects the body ‘s immunity and changes in intestinal flora. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary Hong-bailanshen (HBLS) supplementation in horses on serum biochemical profile, antioxidant enzymes and gut microbiota. Methods: In this study, five horses were selected. On day 0, 14, 28, blood samples and feces were collected on days 0, 14, and 28 to analyse gut microbiota, serum biochemical and redox indexes. Results: The results showed that the addition of HBLS to horse diets significantly decreased the level of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) and significantly increased the activity of total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase and catalase (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Compared with day 14, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase were significantly decreased; however, the level of catalase was significantly increased in the horses continuously fed with HBLS for 28 days (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Alpha diversity analysis was performed that chao1 (p < 0.05), observed_specicies, faith’pd and goods_coverage upregulated in the horses fed HBLS. A total of 24 differential genera were detected adding HBLS to diet increased the abundance of Bacillus, Lactobacillaceae, Leuconostocaceae, Christensenellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Faecalibacterium, Erysipelotrichaceae, Pyramidobacter, Sphaerochaeta, WCHB1-25, Bacteria, Oscillospira, and Acetobacteraceae, while reduced Aerococcus, EtOH8, Syntrophomonas, Caulobacter, Bradyrhizobiaceae, W22, Succinivibrionaceae, and Desulfovibrio (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Adding HBLS to the diet could be a potentially effective strategy to improve horses’ health. Copyright © 2024 Ding, Gu, Meng, Hu, Wang and Liu.

ABSTRACT: White markings are characteristic of many equine breeds, being quite common in the Pura Raza Español horses (PRE). These white markings are the result of a lack of melanocytes in the skin and hair. In certain horse breeds, such as the PRE, the presence and extension of white facial markings is penalised in the breed’s patron and morphological competitions, so it would be interesting to include it in their selection genetics programs to select against the presence of this special feature. The aim of this study was to calculate the prevalence of white facial markings in a representative population sample of PRE and determine its prevalence depending on the coat colour, its genetic parameters and the influence of systematic effects. The white facial markings have been classified into 5 score. A total of 42,080 PRE horses were analysed. Genetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian procedure with the BLUPF90 software. Systematic effects included in the model were: birth period, sex, birth stud geographical area and inbreeding coefficient. The pedigree information included 93,322 horses. The prevalence was 34.2%. Systematics factors were significant in the presentation of facial white markings. Heritability in real scale ranged from 0.53 for black to 0.32 for the chestnut coat colour population, both in the linear heterogeneity model. White facial markings were more prevalent in inbred chestnut males of Spain. The additive genetic base shows that the prevalence could be managed by genetic selection. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: There is controversy about the clinical relevance of congenital variants of the ventral laminae of the sixth (C6) and seventh (C7) cervical vertebrae and their relationship with other radiological abnormalities. Objectives: To document the prevalence of congenital variants of C6 and C7 and that of other radiological abnormalities from C6 to the second thoracic vertebra (T2). Study design: Cross-sectional. Methods: The study included Warmblood horses ≥3 years of age undergoing clinical assessment at two referral institutions: 127 control horses and 96 cases (neurologic, neck pain or stiffness, or neck-related forelimb lameness). All horses underwent a standardised orthopaedic and neurologic examination. Lateral–lateral and lateral 45°–55° ventral–lateral dorsal (left to right and right to left) radiographic views of C5 to T2 were acquired and assessed blinded to the horse's clinical category using a predetermined grading system. Results: The ventral profile of C7 was abnormal in 54 horses (24.2%). Cases were less likely to have congenital variants than control horses, p = 0.0002, relative risk (RR): 0.63 (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 0.4, 1.0). There was no association between the presence of a congenital variant of C7 and the presence of modelling of the articular processes (APs) of C6–C7, C7–T1 or T1–T2. Cases were more likely to have severe modelling of the APs at C6–C7, p = 0.01, RR: 1.94, CI: 1.1, 3.5 and C7–T1, p = 0.04, RR: 1.97, CI: 1.2, 3.2 compared with control horses. Main limitations: Radiographs were read by one assessor independently at each institution. Conclusions: There was no association between the presence of congenital variants of C7 and any other radiological findings. Congenital variants occurred less frequently in cases compared with control horses. There was no association between the presence or absence of a congenital variant and the type of case. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest malignant tumors, which is a serious threat to human health and life, and it is expected that pancreatic cancer may be the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries by 2030. Claudin18.2 is a tight junction protein expressed in normal gastric mucosal tissues, which is involved in the formation of tight junctions between cells and affects the permeability of paracellular cells. Claudin18.2 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and is associated with the initiation, progression, metastasis and prognosis of cancer, so it is considered a potential therapeutic target. Up to now, a number of clinical trials for Claudin18.2 are underway, including solid tumors such as pancreatic cancers and gastric cancers, and the results of these trials have not yet been officially announced. This manuscript briefly describes the Claudia protein, the dual roles of Cluadin18 in cancers, and summarizes the ongoing clinical trials targeting Claudin18.2 with a view to integrating the research progress of Claudin18.2 targeted therapy. In addition, this manuscript introduces the clinical research progress of Claudin18.2 positive pancreatic cancer, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, CAR-T cell therapy, and hope to provide feasible ideas for the clinical treatment of Claudin18.2 positive pancreatic cancer.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Lameness originating from the distal limb is common in sport horses and can vary depending on the dynamics of movement and the surface, with differences in shoeing exacerbating this variability. Driving horses work primarily on hard surfaces (pavement), whereas dressage horses work primarily on soft surfaces (riding arenas with sand). Driving horses are traditionally shod with small fixed studs made of hard metal, which are attached to the horseshoe at 4 points, while dressage horses are shod with a simple horseshoe. We investigated the hypothesis that there is a difference in the pathological radiographic findings of the distal limbs between driving and dressage horses. The variability in the stable management and training program was minimized by including horses from the same farm. Methods: Twenty horses in a driving training program and 20 horses in a dressage program were included in the study. Radiographs of the both front feet were obtained and quantitatively evaluated for radiographic changes by three surgery/diagnostic imaging specialists. Interrater reliability was measured, and multivariate analysis was performed to compare differences in pathological radiographic findings of the distal limbs between the two groups. Results: Kendal’s concordance coefficient indicated an agreement among raters (Kw ≠ 0) for all observations. Radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease of the distal interphalangeal joint were more common in the group of driving horses compared to dressage horses. Conclusion: Our hypothesis was confirmed, as there were significant pathological differences between groups in distal articular margin of middle phalanx, joint space narrowing, and irregular joint surface of the middle phalanx.

ABSTRACT: Case history: Medical records from 2009 to 2021 from a private equine referral hospital in Rochester, NH, USA were analysed for cases that underwent general anaesthesia for low-field MRI of the distal limb. These were used to determine peri-anaesthetic morbidity and mortality. Clinical findings and outcome: Two hundred and forty-three anaesthetic episodes were recorded in horses undergoing low-field MRI. The peri-anaesthetic complication rate prior to discharge was 6.2% (15/243). No patients experienced a fatal complication. Ninety two of the 243 patients had multiple sites imaged, 90/243 received pre-anaesthetic dantrolene, 134/243 received intra-anaesthetic dobutamine, and 15/243 were positioned in dorsal recumbency. Complications included: abdominal discomfort (“colic”; 9/243), myopathy (4/243), hyphaema (1/243) and carpal fracture (1/243). At the time of discharge, 14/15 complications had resolved. Of 135 horses for which data were available 55 became hypotensive during the procedure (lowest mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg). Median body weight was 553 (min 363, max 771) kg. Horses were anaesthetised for a median of 150 (min 45, max 210) minutes. There was no evidence of an association between higher body weight (p = 0.051) or longer duration of anaesthesia (p = 0.421) and development of an anaesthetic complication. For categorical variables (dantrolene administration pre-anaesthesia, dobutamine administration during anaesthesia, hypotension (mean < 65 mmHg) during anaesthesia, dorsal vs. lateral recumbency, and imaging of single vs. multiple sites), the 95% CI for the OR included 1, indicating a lack of effect of the variable on the odds of complication. Clinical relevance: The cases included in this series suggest that low-field MRI under general anaesthesia is a viable option for diagnostic imaging in otherwise healthy horses. Complications occur, but most resolve before discharge. © 2024 New Zealand Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) are common in racehorses and have been of increasing concern in horses travelling internationally to compete. Understanding the differences in bone turnover between local horses and international horses following long-distance air transportation may inform MSI prevention strategies. Objectives: To understand the differences in bone turnover markers and risk of MSI between local horses and international horses following long-distance air transportation. Study design: Prospective cohort. Methods: The concentrations of bone turnover markers (OCN and CTXI), markers of stress (cortisol), inflammation (serum amyloid A) and circadian rhythm (melatonin), and bisphosphonates were determined in blood samples collected twice (14–17 days apart), from horses following international travel (n = 69), and from local horses (n = 79). The associations between markers, long-distance travel and MSI were determined using multivariable generalised linear regression models. Results: Within 3–5 days post-transport, concentrations of cortisol in international horses were higher than those of local horses (main effect, Coef. 0.39; 95% CI 0.24, 0.54; p < 0.001) but they decreased and were not different to those of local horses at the second timepoint (interaction effect, Coef. −0.27; 95% CI −0.46, −0.07; p = 0.007). After adjusting for age and sex, OCN and CTXI were not significantly different between international and local horses; however, OCN was lower in international horses at timepoint 2 (interaction effect, Coef. −0.16; 95% CI −0.31, −0.01; p = 0.043). The prevalence of MSI was higher in the international (26%; 95% CI 16, 38%) compared with local horses (8%; 95% CI 3, 16%; p < 0.001), with all severe MSI sustained by the international horses. At the second timepoint compared with the first timepoint post-transport, cortisol remained high or increased (interaction effect, Coef. 0.43; 95% CI 0.24, 0.61; p < 0.001) and OCN increased (interaction effect, Coef. 0.26; 95% CI 0.08, 0.44; p = 0.006) in the horses that sustained severe MSI. Main limitations: Horse population and racing career parameters differed between groups. Bone turnover markers have low sensitivity to detect local bone changes. Conclusions: Most horses showed minimal effects of long-distance air transport within 2 weeks relative to local horses as assessed by stress and bone turnover markers. Screening for persistent high cortisol and evidence of net bone formation after long-distance air transportation may help to identify racehorses at high risk of catastrophic MSI. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: Develop, implement, and monitor for adverse effects of, a novel hemoperfusion therapy in adult horses. Methods: A prospective, observational feasibility study using three healthy adult horses from the North Carolina State University teaching herd. Health status was determined by physical exam, complete blood count, coagulation panel, and serum biochemistry. Each horse was instrumented with a 14 Fr × 25 cm double-lumen temporary hemodialysis catheter and underwent a 240 min polymer-based hemoperfusion session. Horses were administered unfractionated heparin to maintain anti-coagulation during the session. Given the novelty of this therapy in horses, each horse was treated as a learning opportunity that informed an iterative process of protocol development and modification. Measurements and main results: Our long-term goal is to investigate potential clinical applications of hemoperfusion in horses, including cytokine reduction in horses with severe SIRS/sepsis. Horses were monitored for changes in clinical exam, biochemistry and hematology parameters. Additionally, cytokines were quantified to determine whether extracorporeal hemadsorption therapy alone caused an inflammatory response. Our results show that hemoperfusion therapy was associated with decreased platelet counts and serum albumin concentration. There was no significant change in plasma cytokine concentrations with hemoperfusion therapy. In one horse, the cytokine concentrations decreased, as previously reported with hemoperfusion therapy in humans. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that hemoperfusion therapy could be performed in healthy adult horses without significant adverse effects. Conclusion: Polymer-based hemoperfusion is a feasible extracorporeal therapy (ECT) modality for adult horses. Additional studies are needed to further establish clinical protocols, as well as establish efficacy of polymer-based hemoperfusion for treatment of various conditions in horses, including intoxications, immune-mediated conditions, and sepsis.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory diseases considerably affect equine athletes, being the second most common cause of poor performance. Among these diseases, fungal pneumonia in horses, caused specifically by Aspergillus spp., is relatively rare but potentially fatal. Fungal pneumonia typically affects horses exposed to fungal elements due to environmental factors, immunosuppression, or previous debilitating illnesses. Treatment is complex, with minimal success due to late diagnosis and serious concomitant underlying diseases. The choice of medication depends on the site of infection, the fungal species involved, and financial considerations. This report describes a case of pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosed in a 10-year-old castrated Quarter Horse. Transtracheal lavage revealed fungal elements characteristic of Aspergillus fumigatus. Treatment with dexamethasone, bromhexine hydrochloride, and itraconazole led to a successful recovery. The diagnosis of equine aspergillosis is challenging because its clinical signs overlap with other respiratory diseases. Fungal infections like aspergillosis are gaining attention in the equine health scene. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics and prevent antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, veterinarians and horse handlers must be aware of the risks of spreading aspergillosis to humans, emphasizing preventative measures and respiratory protection. © 2024 Society of Veterinary Medicine of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Equine asthma (EA) is a common lower airway disease in horses, but whether its pathogenesis is allergic is ambiguous. Extrinsic stimuli like hay dust induce acute exacerbation of clinical signs and sustained local neutrophilic inflammation in susceptible horses. Aspergillus fumigatus is an EA stimulus, but it is unclear if it merely acts as an IgE-provoking allergen. We aimed to comprehensively analyze immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes in EA, elucidating their binding to different A. fumigatus antigens, and their quantities systemically in serum and locally in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Methods: Serum and BALF from healthy horses (HE, n = 18) and horses with mild-moderate asthma (MEA, n = 20) or severe asthma (SEA, n = 24) were compared. Ig isotype (IgG1, IgG3/5, IgG4/7, IgG6, IgA, and IgE) binding to nine antigens (A. fumigatus lysate, and recombinant Asp f 1, Asp f 7, Asp f 8, dipeptidyl-peptidase 5, class II aldolase/adducin domain protein, glucoamylase, beta-hexosaminidase, and peptide hydrolase) was compared by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Total Ig isotype contents were determined by bead-based assays. Results: MEA and SEA differed from HE but hardly from each other. Compared to HE, asthmatic horses showed increased anti-A. fumigatus binding of IgG (BALF and serum) and IgA (BALF). Serum and BALF IgE binding and total IgE contents were similar between HE and EA. Single antigens, as well as A. fumigatus lysate, yielded similar Ig binding patterns. Serum and BALF IgG1 binding to all antigens was increased in SEA and to several antigens in MEA. Serum IgG4/7 binding to two antigens was increased in SEA. BALF IgA binding to all antigens was increased in SEA and MEA. Total BALF IgG1 and IgG4/7 contents were increased in SEA, and serum IgG4/7 content was increased in MEA compared to HE. Yet, total isotype contents differentiated EA and HE less clearly than antigen-binding Ig. Discussion: A. fumigatus immunogenicity was confirmed without identification of single dominant antigens here. A. fumigatus provoked elevated BALF IgG1 and IgA binding, and these isotypes appear relevant for neutrophilic EA, which does not support allergy. BALF Ig isotype differentiation beyond IgE is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of immune responses to fungi in EA pathogenesis.

ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritis (OA) remains a major cause of lameness in horses, which leads to lost days of training and early retirement. Still, the underlying pathological processes are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that serve as regulators of many biological processes including OA. Analysis of miRNA expression in diseased joint tissues such as cartilage and synovial membrane may help to elucidate OA pathology. Since integrin α10β1-selected mesenchymal stem cell (integrin α10-MSC) have shown mitigating effect on equine OA we here investigated the effect of integrin α10-MSCs on miRNA expression. Cartilage and synovial membrane was harvested from the middle carpal joint of horses with experimentally induced, untreated OA, horses with experimentally induced OA treated with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs selected for the marker integrin α10-MSCs, and from healthy control joints. miRNA expression in cartilage and synovial membrane was established by quantifying 70 pre-determined miRNAs by qPCR. Differential expression of the miRNAs was evaluated by comparing untreated OA and control, untreated OA and MSC-treated OA, and joints with high and low pathology score. A total of 60 miRNAs were successfully quantified in the cartilage samples and 55 miRNAs were quantified in the synovial membrane samples. In cartilage, miR-146a, miR-150 and miR-409 had significantly higher expression in untreated OA joints than in control joints. Expression of miR-125a-3p, miR-150, miR-200c, and miR-499-5p was significantly reduced in cartilage from MSC-treated OA joints compared to the untreated OA joints. Expression of miR-139-5p, miR-150, miR-182-5p, miR-200a, miR-378, miR-409-3p, and miR-7177b in articular cartilage reflected pathology score. Several of these miRNAs are known from research in human patients with OA and from murine OA models. Our study shows that these miRNAs are also differentially expressed in experimental equine OA, and that expression depends on OA severity. Moreover, MSC treatment, which resulted in less severe OA, also affected miRNA expression in cartilage.

ABSTRACT: This case report presents the first reported identifications of 20-hydroxyecdysone in post-event blood samples from an Endurance horse and a Harness horse racing in New South Wales, Australia. 20-Hydroxyecdysone is a plant secondary metabolite structurally related to testosterone and used by plants to discourage insect predation. 20-Hydroxyecdysone is found in many plants including spinach and is not infrequently identified at low concentrations in mammalian systems including in humans. Given its steroid-related structure, 20-hydroxyecdys-one has been reported to enhance athletic performance in humans, although at this time 20-hydroxyecdysone is simply being monitored by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) [31]. The Harness horse identification led the Harness Racing New South Wales (HRNSW) authorities to evaluate the home pastures of the horse in question, where they recovered at least three plants containing significant concentrations of 20-hydroxyecdysone. The HRNSW stewards were satisfied that the 20-hydroxyecdysone identification was due to “environmental contamination emanated from plants” in the trainer's establishment and did not impose a penalty on the trainer. These findings show that the pasture plant steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone is found in pasture plants from which it is bioavailable to equines and can present as low part per billion concentrations in equine blood samples, as has also been noted in humans. Based on these Australian identifications of 20-hydroxyecdysone in pasture plants and also in equine blood samples and the HRNSW decision not to penalize the trainer involved and the likelihood of no pharmacological response to pasture plant exposure to this substance we now present 2 parts per billion in equine blood/plasma as an appropriate regulatory cut-off or Screening Limit of Detection (SLOD) for 20-hydroxecdysone in equine blood/plasma. © 2024 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Herpesviruses establish a well-adapted balance with their host’s immune system. Despite this co-evolutionary balance, infections can lead to severe disease including neurological disorders in their natural host. In horses, equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory disease, abortions, neonatal foal death and myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in ~10% of acute infections worldwide. Many aspects of EHM pathogenesis and protection from EHM are still poorly understood. However, it has been shown that the incidence of EHM increases to >70% in female horses >20 years of age. In this study we used old mares as an experimental equine EHV-1 model of EHM to identify host-specific factors contributing to EHM. Following experimental infection with the neuropathogenic strain EHV-1 Ab4, old mares and yearling horses were studied for 21 days post-infection. Nasal viral shedding and cell-associated viremia were assessed by quantitative PCR. Cytokine/chemokine responses were evaluated in nasal secretions and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by Luminex assay and in whole blood by quantitative real-time PCR. EHV-1-specific IgG sub-isotype responses were measured by ELISA. All young horses developed respiratory disease and a bi-phasic fever post-infection, but only 1/9 horses exhibited ataxia. In contrast, respiratory disease was absent in old mares, but all old mares developed EHM that resulted in euthanasia in 6/9 old mares. Old mares also presented significantly decreased nasal viral shedding but higher viremia coinciding with a single fever peak at the onset of viremia. According to clinical disease manifestation, horses were sorted into an EHM group (nine old horses and one young horse) and a non-EHM group (eight young horses) for assessment of host immune responses. Non-EHM horses showed an early upregulation of IFN-α (nasal secretions), IRF7/IRF9, IL-1β, CXCL10 and TBET (blood) in addition to an IFN-γ upregulation during viremia (blood). In contrast, IFN-α levels in nasal secretions of EHM horses were low and peak levels of IRF7, IRF9, CXCL10 and TGF-β (blood) coincided with viremia. Moreover, EHM horses showed significantly higher IL-10 levels in nasal secretions, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CSF and higher serum IgG3/5 antibody titres compared to non-EHM horses. These results suggest that protection from EHM depends on timely induction of type 1 IFN and upregulation cytokines and chemokines that are representative of cellular immunity. In contrast, induction of regulatory or TH-2 type immunity appeared to correlate with an increased risk for EHM. It is likely that future vaccine development for protection from EHM must target shifting this ‘at-risk’ immunophenotype. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Diet is one of the main factors influencing the intestinal microbiota in horses, yet a systematic characterization of the microbiota along the length of the digestive tract in clinically healthy horses, homogenous for age and breed and receiving a specific diet is lacking. Methods: The study used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the microbiota of the intestinal tracts of 19 healthy Bardigiano horses of 14.3 ± 0.7 months of age fed one of two diets. Nine horses received a high-starch diet (HS), and ten horses received a high-fiber diet (HF). After 129 days, the horses were slaughtered, and samples were collected from the different intestinal tract compartments. Results and discussion: The microbiota alpha diversity indices were lower in the caecum, pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon of the horses fed the HS diet (False Discovery Rate, FDR < 0.05). The values of beta diversity indicated significant compositional differences between the studied intestinal tract compartments according to the diet received (FDR < 0.05). At the lower taxonomic level (genus or family), the HS diet was associated with a higher relative frequency of Enterobacteriaceae within the small intestine (jejunum and duodenum) (FDR < 0.05). Within the hindgut (caecum and sternal flexure), the HS diet was associated with lower relative frequencies (i.e., a smaller core community) of bacteria belonging to Fibrobacteraceae and Prevotellaceae (FDR < 0.05). Moreover, horses fed the HS diet displayed a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus in the caecum (FDR < 0.05) and Fusobacterium in the sternal flexure (FDR < 0.05), both of which are pathogenic bacteria responsible for inflammation diseases. Samples collected from the pelvic flexure and rectum of horses fed the HS diet showed significantly higher relative frequencies of Succinivibrionaceae (FDR < 0.05) – amylolytic bacteria associated with acidosis. The relative frequencies of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were lower in the feces collected from the rectum of horses receiving the HS diet vs. HF diet, indicating smaller core communities of these bacteria (FDR < 0.05). Fibrous diets should be promoted to prevent dysbiosis of the microbiota associated with high-starch diet.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to analyze the morphometric diversity of the Gayo Horse as the germplasm of native Indonesian horses in accordance with the Decree of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia No.1054/Kpts/SR.120/10/2014 in order to obtain standardized data on the size of the Gayo horse morphometrics which are also part of the conservation and preservation effort of the Gayo horse as a local horse genetic resources. The research was conducted in Central Aceh, Bener Meriah. and Gayo Lues Regency on 87 male Gayo Horses. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling and the collected data were then analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis. Based on the results of the study, male Gayo horses had an average (cm) body length of 102.96 ± 29.69, body height of 113.62 ± 3.53, chest circumference of 136.92 ± 7.07, hip witdh of 37.14 ± 7.77 and scrotal circumference of 24.4±5.56. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance poses an escalating global threat, rendering traditional drug development approaches increasingly ineffective. Thus, novel alternatives to antibiotic-based therapies are needed. Exploiting pathogen cooperation as a strategy for combating resistant infections has been proposed but lacks experimental validation. Empirical findings demonstrate the successful invasion of cooperating populations by non-cooperating cheats, effectively reducing virulence in vitro and in vivo. The idea of harnessing cooperative behaviours for therapeutic benefit involves exploitation of the invasive capabilities of cheats to drive medically beneficial traits into infecting populations of cells. In this study, we employed Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing cheats to drive antibiotic sensitivity into both in vitro and in vivo resistant populations. We demonstrated the successful invasion of cheats, followed by increased antibiotic effectiveness against cheat-invaded populations, thereby establishing an experimental proof of principle for the potential application of the Trojan strategy in fighting resistant infections. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly used in standing horses, so it is important to understand an efficient application of these imaging modalities. Objective: To compare CBCT and MRI findings in the metacarpo (MCP)/metatarsophalangeal (MTP) region of clinical patients imaged for diagnostic purposes. Study design: Retrospective study. Methods: The CBCT and MRI images of the MCP/MTP region from equine clinical patients undergoing both standing MRI and CBCT imaging for lameness localised to the fetlock region (2021–2023) were retrospectively reviewed. Presence, location and imaging features of lesions were compared between modalities using descriptive analysis. Results: Imaging studies of 24 MCP/MTP regions from 22 horses were included. CBCT provided the assessment of subchondral bone integrity in palmar/plantar osteochondral disease, details of the length and associated attenuation changes of third metacarpal/tarsal parasagittal groove and proximal phalanx sagittal groove fissures, structural integrity and attenuation changes of subchondral and trabecular bone injuries, proximal phalanx dorsoproximal defects and anatomical and structural details of proximal sesamoid bone injuries. MRI provided the evaluation of short tau inversion recovery (STIR) hyperintensity associated with bone lesions and the extent of increased fluid accumulation in bone. CBCT revealed reduced joint space, indicating articular cartilage loss, while MRI showed joint distension and synovitis. MRI revealed generalised osseous STIR hyperintensity associated with septic arthritis. Soft tissue injuries were most identified by MRI except for heterotopic mineralisation most detected by CBCT. Main limitations: Imaging findings not verified by a gold standard. Conclusions: CBCT and MRI contributed different diagnostic information so optimal information was obtained by using both modalities. Standing CBCT showed changes in bone structure and attenuation but was limited in detecting soft tissue injuries. Standing MRI showed increased fluid accumulation in bone and soft tissue injuries but was limited in assessing structural details of bone injuries. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Studies carried out in several species have demonstrated that detection of low-calorie sweeteners in the lumen of the intestine, by the sweet receptor, T1R2-T1R3, initiates a signaling pathway leading to enhanced expression and activity of intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter 1, SGLT1. This results in an increased gut capacity to absorb glucose, sodium chloride and water, the basis for oral rehydration therapy. Horses express T1R2, T1R3 and downstream signaling elements in the intestinal tissue. As such, the potential of sweetener-stimulation of T1R2-T1R3 leading to upregulation of SGLT1 allows the provision of more glucose (energy) and hydration for horses. This is especially important when the need for glucose increases during strenuous exercise, pregnancy, and lactation. There are significant differences among species in the ability to detect sweeteners. Amino acid substitutions and pseudogenization of taste receptor genes underlie these variations. Nothing is known about the sweetener specificity of horse T1R2-T1R3. Using heterologous expression methodology, we demonstrate that sweeteners sucralose, stevia and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC) activate horse T1R2-T1R3, but cyclamate does not. Determination of sweetener specificity of equine sweet receptor is crucial for developing suitable dietary additives to optimize glucose absorption, hydration and avoiding the intestinal disease brought about by microbial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate reaching the large intestine.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the stable isotope hydrology of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada over a five year period from September, 2017 to August, 2022. The δ2H and δ18O values of integrated monthly precipitation were weakly seasonal and ranged from –66 to –15 ‰ and from –9.7 to –1.9 ‰, respectively. Fitting these monthly precipitation data resulted in a local meteoric water line (LMWL) defined by: δ2H = 7.22 ± 0.21 · δ18O + 7.50 ± 1.22 ‰. Amount-weighted annual precipitation had δ2H and δ18O values of –36 ± 11 ‰ and –6.1 ± 1.4 ‰, respectively. Deep groundwater had more negative δ2H and δ18O values than mean annual precipitation, suggesting recharge occurs mainly in the winter, while shallow groundwater had δ2H and δ18O values more consistent with mean annual precipitation or mixing of freshwater with local seawater. Surface waters had more positive values and showed evidence of isolation from the groundwater system. The stable isotopic compositions of plant (leaf) water, on the other hand, indicate plants use groundwater as their source. Fog had δ2H and δ18O values that were significantly more positive than those of local precipitation, yet had similar 17O-excess values. δ2H values of horsehair from 4 individuals lacked seasonality, but had variations typical to those of precipitation on the island. Differences in mean δ2H values of horsehair were statistically significant and suggest variations in water use may exist between spatially disparate horse communities. Our results establish an important initial framework for ongoing isotope studies of feral horses and other wildlife on Sable Island. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Trypanosomosis, such as Surra, causes significant damage to livestock worldwide. The development of new serological diagnostic methods is highly relevant. The primary objective of this study was to produce a recombinant GM6 antigen derived from T. evansi and investigate its immunological properties for the detection and diagnosis of trypanosomosis. To create a recombinant antigen, bioinformatic analysis of the primary structure of T. evansi GM6 antigen from several regions was carried out. The protein sequence was reverse translated to the nucleotide sequence, after which the gene was synthesized using solid-phase method. The gene fragment, encoding the GM6 protein, was inserted or cloned into the pET28 expression vector after synthesis. The obtained sequences were checked by sequenc-ing for correspondence to the matrix molecule. For transformation E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain was used. To assess the efficacy of the antigen, immunoassay analysis and blot-hybridization techniques were employed. Obtained results showed that 1mM isopropyl ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction at 2℃ for 18 hours was the most optimal con-dition for expression of recombinant GM6 T. evansi antigen. From a 500 ml of growth medium, a total of 3.4 mg of recombinant protein was successfully obtained. A recombinant GM6 antigen of T. evansi encoding a 30 kDa polypep-tide was developed, which has diagnostically significant sensitivity in the enzyme immunoassay at a dilution of 1:6400 with sera of horses and donkeys infected with trypanosomosis. The proposed test system can be used for diagnosis of trypanosomosis in the early stages of the disease. © 2024 by the authors. Licensee ResearchersLinks Ltd, England, UK.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Diagnosing and treating lameness in horses is essential to improving their welfare. In equine orthopedic practice, infrared thermography (IRT) can indirectly detect soreness. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can treat painful and inflammatory processes in horses. Using IRT, the efficacy of meloxicam (Maxicam Gel®) was evaluated in pre-treating transient synovitis in horses induced by a middle carpal joint injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from E. coli 055:B5 at a dose of 10 endotoxin units. Methods: In a cross-over design, six healthy horses were randomly assigned to receive either 0.6 mg/kg of oral Maxicam Gel® (MAXVO) or a mock administration (control group, C) following a two-week washout period. IRT of the middle carpal joint, visual lameness assessment and joint circumference were recorded over time. Clinical and hematological evaluations were performed. Synovial fluid aspirates were analyzed for total nucleated cell count, total protein, and prostaglandin E2. A mixed effects analysis of variance was performed for repeated measures over time, followed by Tukey’s test. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted to determine whether there is a relationship between a thermography temperature change and the lameness score. Results: There were no changes in joint circumference. The MAXVO group showed a lower rectal temperature 4 h after synovitis induction. The C group presented an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in total hemoglobin and hematocrit 8 h after induction. No changes were observed in the synovial fluid between groups. The horses that received meloxicam did not show clinically significant lameness at any time, while the C group showed an increase in lameness 2, 4, and 8 h after synovitis induction. Discussion: IRT indicated that the skin surface temperature of the middle carpal joint was lower in horses who received meloxicam, suggesting a reduction in the inflammatory process induced by LPS. It was observed that the maximum temperature peaks in the dorsopalmar and lateropalmar positions can be utilized to predict the severity of lameness, particularly when the temperature rises above 34°C. Horses pre-treated with meloxicam showed either reduced or no indication of mild to moderate pain and presented a lowehr thermographic temperature, which indicates the effectiveness of Maxicam Gel® as an anti-inflammatory.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the impact of activated carbon, palm activated carbon, and zeolite on horse oil (HO) extracted from horse neck fat using supercritical fluid extraction with deodorant-untreated HO (CON) as a comparison. The yield and lipid oxidation of deodorant untreated HO (CON) were not significantly affected by the three deodorants. However, deodorant-treated HOs exhibited significantly elevated levels of α-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) and eicosenoic acid (C20:1n9) compared to CON (p<0.05), while other fatty acids remained consistent. Zeolite-purified HO demonstrated significantly lower levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than other treatments (p<0.05). Remarkably, zeolite decreased the concentration of pentane, 2, 3-dimethyl (gasoline odor), by over 90%, from 177.17 A.U. ×106 in CON to 15.91 A.U. ×106. Zeolite also effectively eliminates sec-butylamine (ammonia and fishy odor) as compared to other deodorant-treated HOs (p<0.05). Additionally, zeolite reduced VOCs associated with the fruity citrus flavor, such as nonanal, octanal, and D-limonene in HO (p<0.05). This study suggests that integrating zeolite in supercritical fluid extraction enhances HO purification by effectively eliminating undesirable VOCs, presenting a valuable approach for producing high-quality HO production in the cosmetic and functional food industries. © KoSFA.

ABSTRACT: Acute diarrhoea due to colitis/typhlocolitis is a life-threatening disease of adult horses that is both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Treatments are predominantly supportive, including fluid therapy, colloid oncotic support and nutritional support. There are a lack of specific and effective therapies for equine colitis, providing a challenge in practice for the prevention of serious and fatal complications. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves the transfer of faecal bacteria and other microbes from a healthy individual into another individual, with the aim of restoring a healthy gut microbiota and is often used as a ‘last resort’ therapy. This procedure has been recommended as a treatment for acute diarrhoea in horses and has proven efficacy in the treatment of some cases of acute diarrhoea in people. This critically appraised topic reviewed the published literature on the outcomes associated with faecal transplantation in adult horses affected by acute diarrhoea/colitis. Only six published studies met the inclusion criteria (including one systematic review). The studies found varying results regarding the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of colitis/diarrhoea in the adult horse but overall there was weak evidence to support the use of faecal transplantation in addition to other standard treatments for the management of adult horses affected by colitis, although further controlled studies of defined categories of disease are required. © 2024 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: From February to December 2021, 960 serum samples from different climate regions in two Mexican states were analyzed for antibodies against EIAV using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests. The overall seroprevalence of EIAV infection in equids determined by ELISA and AGID tests was 19.69% and 17.60%, respectively. The highest rate of seropositivity was observed in the state of Veracruz (23.67%, using AGID test), and the lowest rate was found in the state of Puebla (13.12%, using cELISA test). In total, 17.45% (85/487, using AGID test) and 15.40% (75/487, using cELISA test) of horses were positive for EIAV infection. Donkeys showed a prevalence of 19.87% (94/473) in cELISA and 21.99% (104/476) in AGID. The cELISA was compared with AGID as the gold standard test. The diagnostic sensitivity for horses and donkeys was 90.4% and 92.2%, and the specificity was 97.5% and 97.3%, respectively, with an almost perfect degree of agreement (kappa values of 0.871 and 0.888). Therefore, the overall seroprevalence rate of EIAV infection in equines in the sampled states of Puebla and Veracruz was 19.3%, with 91.4% sensitivity, 97.4% specificity, and an agreement of 96.25%, indicating almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.880). © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: Background: Over-the-wire (OTW) catheter placement is performed frequently in horses. Intravascular loss of a guidewire has been anecdotally reported, but there is limited information regarding the treatment and outcome of horses that have experienced this complication of OTW catheter placement. Objectives: Describe the clinical and diagnostic features, treatment, and outcome of horses experiencing IV guidewire loss at the time of OTW catheter placement. Animals: Thirteen horses. Methods: Multicenter retrospective study to identify horses with IV guidewire loss. Horses of all ages were considered for inclusion. Horses were excluded from the study if complete medical records of signalment, indication, and outcome were not available. Intravenous guidewire loss was defined as the guidewire being lost IV at the time of OTW catheter placement. Results: No horses in this study experienced adverse clinical signs associated with the loss of a guidewire. Eight horses had the guidewire removed and the guidewire was left in situ in 5 horses. None of the horses with the guidewire in situ had experienced long-term effects. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Intravenous guidewire loss seems to have a good long-term prognosis even in horses in which removal of the guidewire was not possible. Thus, in horses where guidewire removal is not feasible, guidewires that remain in situ may have limited to no adverse effects. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Mycoplasma equirhinis is the predominant equine Mycoplasma sp. isolated from clinically normal horses and is suspected to be associated with inflammatory airway disease in which cough is the primary sign. Quantitative evaluation of bacterial counts is useful in assessing the association between the bacteria in samples and observed clinical signs, but this evaluation has been difficult with conventional culture methods of M. equirhinis given the need for pre-enrichment using liquid cultures. We established a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the quantification of M. equirhinis, targeting the hypothetical protein FJM08_00025. We confirmed its high species-specificity for M. equirhinis and a limit of detection of 2.9 copies/reaction. We quantified M. equirhinis in tracheal wash samples from 20 clinically normal horses and 22 coughing horses. The copy numbers detected by qPCR in 18 of the 22 samples from clinically affected horses were within the range detected in the 20 clinically normal horses (0–84 copies/reaction). The remaining 4 samples had considerably higher copy numbers (734–1,620,000 copies/reaction), suggesting the likely involvement of M. equirhinis infection. Quantitative evaluation of M. equirhinis over time using our qPCR assay may allow a more accurate assessment of M. equirhinis infection in coughing horses compared to culture methods. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: For economic reasons, high-price milk, such as horse milk (HM), can be adulterated using lower-price milk by unethical producers and traders. Milk adulteration is a serious problem because it is closely associated with the product's quality and safety, which could harm consumers. The purpose of this research was to develop a non-targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) in combination with chemometrics for the detection of goat milk (GM) adulterated in horse milk (HM). Principal component analysis (PCA) successfully differentiated between authentic HM and adulterated HM with GM. In addition, discrimination and classification between authentic and adulterated HM with GM were successfully performed using partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The PLS-DA was confirmed for its accuracy, precision, and validity. Moreover, multivariate regression of partial least squares (PLS) and orthogonal PLS (OPLS) could predict the amount of GM added in HM with high accuracy. Analysis of the variable importance for projection (VIP) and S-line plot found that metabolites of (±)9(10)-EpOME, 1,2:5,6-dianhydro-3,4-dideoxy-1-dodecyl-6-[12-(5-methyl-2-oxo-2,5-dihydro-3-furanyl)dodecyl]hexitol, 1-Palmitoleoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, DG (14:0/18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/0:0), DG (16:1(9Z)/18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/0:0), ditridecanoin, DMG (dimyristoyl glycerol), ethyl palmitoleate, giganin, octadec-9-ynoic acid, and palmitoleic acid were responsible for the discrimination of HM and GM as well as for the prediction of GM in HM. It can be concluded that a non-targeted metabolomics approach using LC-HRMS combined with chemometrics is potential for milk authentication. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2023.

ABSTRACT: Plant peptides are important signaling components in many parts of the plant lifecycle, e.g., development, reproduction, environmental stress response, and plant pathogen defenses. Yet, in maize, one of the most grown crops worldwide, only a few peptides have been identified and studied. In general, molecular research is severely impacted by time-consuming and costly maize transformation, and external application of purified peptides does not allow functional analysis in deeper cell layers due to the thickness of the tissue. In an attempt to bypass these problems while studying the function of small secreted proteins in maize, we established the Trojan Horse approach. Here, tagged peptides are delivered into the maize apoplast in a highly localized fashion by using a genetically modified version of the biotrophic pathogen Ustilago maydis. This technique offers the possibility of rapid testing of predicted maize peptides for in situ functions. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to insulin dysregulation are poorly understood in horses. Therefore, this study aimed to determine if insulin dysregulation is associated with an altered basal expression and extent of phosphorylation of key proteins of the insulin signaling cascade in liver (LT), muscle (MT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) under basal and stimulated conditions. Twelve Icelandic horses were subjected (1) to an oral glucose (Gluc PO) challenge and (2) to an intravenous (Ins IV) insulin challenge in a crossover study. Biopsies of LT, MT, and AT were taken in vivo under basal conditions and after Gluc PO and Ins IV stimulation. Corresponding insulin levels were measured by an equine optimized ELISA (Mercodia AB, Uppsala). Insulin levels ≥ 110 µIU/mL at 120 min indicated that six horses were insulin dysregulated (HI), while six were not (NI). Gluc PO stimulation resulted in a more pronounced hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in HI horses compared to NI horses. Western blot analysis of key proteins of the insulin signaling cascade revealed an enhanced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (InsR) under Gluc PO (P = 0.001) and Ins IV stimulation (P = 0.017) within LT, but not in MT and AT. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B was enhanced under Gluc PO stimulation in all tissues and under Ins IV stimulation in MT and AT, while phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate protein kinase α was reduced after glucose administration (P = 0.005) in all horses. Interestingly, HI horses had significantly higher amounts of phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in MT (P = 0.049), irrespective of any stimulation. In LT, the amount of phosphorylated mTOR decreased under Gluc PO conditions in HI horses, while an increase was observed in NI horses (P = 0.015). A major limitation was the inclusion of only Icelandic horses of advanced age since insulin dysregulation could be related to both the equine metabolic syndrome and/or pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction. In summary, insulin signaling appeared to be maintained in both HI and NI Icelandic horses, although post-receptor alterations were observed. Thus, ID might be an equine-specific metabolic condition, in which alterations of the mTOR signaling pathway may play a crucial role, as emphasized by higher mTOR phosphorylation in HI horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many horse breeds are used for a variety of tasks and studies have shown within breed variations in conformation depending on the task. The Icelandic horse is used for several tasks, e.g. leisure riding, competitions and tour riding. Research about conformation and relationship to subjectively assessed performance (usability) in Icelandic horses used by tourist companies and riding schools (TRh) are lacking. Back condition score has been shown to be associated with weight carrying capacity in the breed. However, the association between back condition score and angle and performance in Icelandic horses participating in a breed evaluation field test (BEFTh) and usability in TRh has not been investigated previously. The aim of the study was to compare body measurements in BEFTh and TRh and examine the relationship with riding ability in BEFTh and usability in TRh. Data of height at withers, back and croup, body condition score (BCS) and back angle were collected in 48 BEFTh (age 8 ± 2 years) and 65 TRh (age 14 ± 5 years). Transversal back angle at the 18th thoracic vertebra was determined using a flexible curve ruler. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the relationship between body measurements and owners' assessment of usability in TRh. The relationship between back condition score and angle and riding ability was evaluated in BEFTh. Compared with TRh, BEFTh had a greater difference between height at withers and height at back and croup, lower BCS and greater back angle (P < 0.05). In TRh, height were positively correlated with usability (P < 0.05). Back condition score and angle were not associated with riding ability in BEFTh or usability in TRh (P > 0.05). In conclusion, body measurements differs between BEFTh and TRh and further studies are needed to investigate if the same conformation traits are associated with good performance in BEFTh and usability in TRh. © 2024 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

ABSTRACT: HE objective of this study is to evaluate the electrocardiographic findings in naturally infected horses by trypanosomiasis as well as to investigate the presence of Trypanosoma sp. in northern Iraq. Twenty-two male horses aged 3-7 years and their weights of 340 to 390 kg were examined. All infected horses showed anaemia, also two horses died, with clinical signs suggestive of heart failure. Results showed trypanosomes in blood smears of infected horses, which was confirmed using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (c-PCR) technique. 12 horses (54.54%) are infected of them 7 (31.82%) were infected with T. evansi and 5 (22.72%) were infected with T. vivax. Clinical, haematological, and electrocardiographic evaluations (ECG) were performed. Serum cardiac troponin (cTnI) biomarker was measured to support ECG findings and a deeper understanding of myocardial tissue damage, and the results were compared with normal values in healthy horses and were found negative for blood smear and PCR. The electrocardiograms showed significant changes which characterized by the length of the P and T waves and the QRS complex in addition to the deviation of the electrical heart axis to the left and tachycardia. The mean values of serum cTnI were significantly higher in T. evansi and T. vivax of infected horses (0.78 and 17.5 ng/m respectively) compared to healthy horses (0.01 range 0.01-0.03 ng/mL). T. evansi and T. vivax are responsible for the incidence of heart lesions, which are associated with heart failure, changes in the electrocardiogram, and death of the affected horses. ©2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

ABSTRACT: Hyperthermia and exertional heat illness (EHI) are performance and welfare issues for all exercising horses. Monitoring the thermoregulatory response allows for early recognition of metabolic heat accumulation during exercise and the possibility of taking prompt and effective preventative measures to avoid a further increase in core body temperature (Tc) leading to hyperthermia. Skin temperature (Tsk) monitoring is most used as a non-invasive tool to assess the thermoregulatory response pre- and post-exercise, particularly employing infrared thermographic equipment. However, only a few studies have used thermography to monitor skin temperature continuously during exercise. This commentary provides an overview of studies investigating surface skin temperature mainly by infrared thermography (IRT) during exercise. The scientific evidence, including methodologies, applications, and challenges associated with (continuous) skin temperature monitoring in horses during field exercise, is discussed. The commentary highlights that, while monitoring Tsk is straightforward, continuous Tsk alone does not always reliably estimate Tc evolvement during field exercise. In addition, inter-individual differences in thermoregulation need to be recognized and accounted for to optimize individual wellbeing. With the ongoing development and application of advanced wearable monitoring technology, there may be future advances in equipment and modeling for timely intervention with horses at hyperthermic risk to improve their welfare. However, at this point, infrared thermographic assessment of Tsk should always be used in conjunction with other clinical assessments and veterinary examinations for a reliable monitoring of the welfare of the horse. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Altered innervation structure and function contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness in human asthma, yet the role of innervation in airflow limitation in asthma in horses remains unknown. Hypothesis: To characterize peribronchial innervation in horses with asthma. We hypothesized that airway innervation increases in horses with asthma compared with controls. Animals: Formalin-fixed lung samples from 8 horses with severe asthma and 8 healthy horses from the Equine Respiratory Tissue Biobank. Ante-mortem lung function was recorded. Methods: Blinded case-control study. Immunohistochemistry was performed using rabbit anti-s100 antibody as a neuronal marker for myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells. The number and cumulative area of nerves in the peribronchial region and associated with airway smooth muscle were recorded using histomorphometry and corrected for airway size. Results: Both the number (median [IQR]: 1.87 × 10−5 nerves/μm2 [1.28 × 10−5]) and the cumulative nerve area (CNA; 1.03 × 10−3 CNA/μm2 [1.57 × 10−3]) were higher in the peribronchial region of horses with asthma compared with controls (5.17 × 10−6 nerves/μm2 [3.76 × 10−6], 4.14 × 10−4 CNA/μm2 [2.54 × 10−4], Mann-Whitney, P =.01). The number of nerves within or lining airway smooth muscle was significantly higher in horses with asthma (4.47 × 10−6 nerves/μm2 [5.75 × 10−6]) compared with controls (2.26 × 10−6 nerves/μm2 [1.16 × 10−6], Mann-Whitney, P =.03). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Asthma in horses is associated with greater airway innervation, possibly contributing to airway smooth muscle remodeling and exacerbating severity of the disease. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Incorporating lunging into a horse’s daily routine aims to enhance fitness, physical condition, and specific skills or exercises when using lunging aids (LAs). To assess the effectiveness of lunging, non-contact technologies like geometric morphometrics and infrared thermography can be employed. This study seeks to evaluate lunging efficiency based on the horse’s posture and surface temperature when lunging with different head and neck positions. The study aims to determine if changes in a horse’s posture correspond to increased metabolic activity, as indicated by body surface temperature. Thirteen horses included in the study were lunged with chambon (CH), rubber band (RB), and triangle side reins (TRs) as well as with a freely moving head (FMH). Images were taken in visible light and infrared. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to analyze horse posture changes and a Pixel-Counting Protocol (PCP) was used to quantify surface temperature patterns. The horses’ posture exhibited contrasting changes, reflected by a changing centroid shape (p < 0.0001) but not size (p > 0.05) when lunged with RB and TRs, but not CH. Different (p < 0.0001) surface temperature patterns were observed during lunging. FMH lunging resulted in lower temperatures over a larger surface, CH induced moderate temperatures on a smaller area, RB caused moderate to high temperatures across a broader surface, and TRs led to higher temperatures over a smaller region. The studied lunging cases returned different (p < 0.0001) surface temperature patterns. Lunging with FMH returned lower temperatures over a larger surface, CH moderate temperatures on a smaller area, RB moderate to high temperatures across a broader surface, and TRs higher temperatures over a smaller region. The proposed methods can be applied to evaluate the efficiency of lunging in horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A 2-year-old Warmblood gelding was presented with a history of bilateral feed material coming from the nostrils secondary to dysphagia, coughing and impairment of physical development, since purchase at 6 months of age. Endoscopy of the right guttural pouch was unremarkable; however, in the left guttural pouch, a distended (aneurysm), pulsating, tortuous elongated internal carotid artery (ICA) was observed. Computed tomography revealed that in the dorsal aspect of the medial compartment of the left guttural pouch adjacent to the jugular foramen, the ICA turned anti-clockwise creating a small loop of 1 cm diameter. This loop had a faint linear, soft tissue attenuating connection to the caudodorsal wall of the guttural pouch and was slightly larger in diameter compared to the right ICA. A malformation of the left ICA was diagnosed, most likely congenital. A secondary compression and neuropathy of one or multiple nerves of the associated lower cranial nerves in the neurovascular plica (IX, X) was suspected explaining the clinical signs of dysphagia. The slightly larger diameter of the left ICA could represent congestion of the vessel or an early aneurysm formation. Based on these findings, endovascular balloon occlusion (nondetachable balloon) of the left ICA was performed to relief the compression on the affected nerves. The occlusion of the ICA resolved the clinical signs within 7 weeks after surgery. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Like most mammalian, polyphasic sleep, equine sleep can be divided into two phases: the REM (rapid eye movement) phase and the NREM (non-rapid eye movement) phase. For this study, a randomized crossover experiment was conducted using ten purebred Lusitano horses, all dressage athletes aged from three to seven years old. The horses were filmed before the intervention to characterize their sleep patterns. REM sleep deprivation was achieved by not letting the horses attain sternal or lateral recumbency for three consecutive days, totaling 72 h. A spatial memory task and a visual attention test were performed. A recording time of 48 h appeared to be long enough to characterize the sleep patterns of the stalled horses. The total recumbency time of the studied population was lower than that previously reported in horses. Although the recumbency times before and after the intervention were similar, there was a tendency shown by the delta (p = 0.0839) towards an increased time needed to resolve spatial memory tasks in the sleep-deprived group. Future studies may deepen the understanding of horse sleep requirements and patterns, and the effects of environmental changes on horse sleep. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ascorbic acid (AA) is an antioxidant that might be beneficial for adjunctive treatment of sepsis in horses. The optimal dose and effects on oxidative status are unknown. Hypothesis: Ascorbic acid administration will increase plasma AA concentrations and decrease determinants of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROM), basal and stimulant-induced intraerythrocytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, and stimulant-induced neutrophil ROS production, and increase plasma antioxidant capacity (PAC) in a dose-dependent manner. Animals: Eight healthy horses. Methods: Randomized placebo-controlled crossover study. Each horse received 4 single-dose IV treatments including AA at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg and saline (placebo) with each treatment separated by ≥1 week. Blood was collected at baseline, 2 and 6 hours for assessment of plasma dROM and PAC via photometer, intraerythrocytic ROS by flow cytometry, and stimulant-induced neutrophil ROS by a fluorometric assay. Plasma AA concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrochemical detection. Results: Ascorbic acid at 100 mg/kg resulted in decreased dROM 2 hours after treatment (P =.03, 95% CI 5.51-121.2, point estimate 63.3). There was no effect of AA on basal or stimulant-induced intraerythrocytic ROS (P =.88, 95% CI −0.156 to 0.081, point estimate −0.037; P =.93, 95% CI −0.123 to 0.112, point estimate −0.006, respectively), basal or stimulant-induced neutrophil ROS (P ≥.12, 95% CI −644.9 to 56.2, point estimate −294.4), or PAC (P ≥.64, 95% CI −1567 to 463.4, point estimate −552.0) at any dose or timepoint. Plasma AA concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: High-dose administration of AA might provide antioxidant benefits in horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to 1) evaluate the interaction of corn grain micronization and starch levels per meal on equine plasma glucose, and 2) determine if micronization affects the risk of hindgut acidosis. Six mature (aged 6 to 10 years), healthy, non-pregnant mares (initial body weight [BW]: 301 to 463 kg) were used in a 2×3 factorial cross-over design. The treatments included two forms of corn grain (ground and micronized flaked) at three levels of starch (1, 1.5, and 2 g/kg BW per meal). The blood was sampled before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min after morning feeding and the glucose concentration in the plasma was determined. Small intestine and hindgut dry matter (DM) disappearances of ground and micronized corn were also compared using in vitro techniques. Micronized flaked corn grain showed three times more in vitro enzymatic DM disappearance (p < 0.001) compared with ground corn. Residues of in vitro enzymatic digestion of micronized flaked corn fermented 38.59 % faster than ground corn during in vitro hindgut incubation. The horses that consumed micronized flaked corn had higher post-prandial plasma glucose concentrations (p < 0.001). Increasing starch levels per meal from 1–2 g/kg BW resulted in higher plasma glucose concentrations (P = 0.005). However, no interaction of processing and starch meal size was found. Overall, processing the corn grain by micronization or increasing starch level per meal increased the plasma glucose concentrations, but the magnitude of the increases did not match that expected from in vitro studies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To investigate pseudohyperkalemia occurring in horses experiencing rhabdomyolysis when serum chemistry profiles are run on an VetScan VS2 analyzer (Abaxis). ANIMALS 18 horses with rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase [CK] > 1,000 U/L). METHODS In 3 horses with serum CK activities > 5,800 U/L and persistent serum potassium concentrations of > 8.5 mmol/L (VetScan VS2), potassium concentrations were reevaluated with either i-STAT Alinity Base Station (Abbott), Catalyst (Idexx), or Cobas c501 (Roche) ion-specific analyzers. Paired serum samples from 15 additional horses (median serum CK activity, 7,601 U/L; range, 1,134 to 192,447 U/L) were analyzed on both VetScan VS2 and Cobas c501 machines. Serum potassium concentrations were compared between the VetScan VS2 and ion-specific analyzers by Bland-Altman and Wilcoxon ranked tests and correlated to log10 CK activity via Pearson correlation. RESULTS Serum potassium concentrations were significantly higher on the VetScan VS2 (6.7 ± 1.6 mmol/L) versus the ion-specific analyzers (4.0 ± 1.1 mmol/L; P < .0001), with high bias shown in Bland-Altman analysis (43.1 ± 27.9). Potassium concentrations positively correlated with log10 CK activity with the VetScan VS2 (R2 = 0.51; P = .003) but not the Cobas (R2 = 0.09; P = .3) analyzer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE An alternate analyzer to the VetScan VS2 should be used to evaluate serum potassium concentrations in horses with rhabdomyolysis because the VetScan VS2 methodology uses lactate dehydrogenase, which increases in serum with rhabdomyolysis and falsely elevates potassium concentrations. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To determine the influence of a stainless-steel cable (SSC) tension band fixation as an adjunct to a locking compression plate (LCP) for arthrodesis of the equine metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Study design: Experimental. An ex vivo biomechanical paired equine cadaver limb study. Sample population: Five MCP joint pairs were collected from adult Thoroughbred horses, euthanized for reasons unrelated to orthopedic disease. Methods: Each pair of MCP joints were randomly implanted with either a dorsally placed 5.5 mm LCP and a palmarly placed 2.0 mm SSC or a dorsally placed 5.5 mm LCP alone. Each construct was tested in cyclic loading followed by single cycle to failure in axial compression. Displacement at a target load of 1 kN over 3600 cycles at 1 Hz was recorded prior to single cycle to failure testing. Results: In cyclic testing, displacement was not significantly different between the first and last 5% of testing cycles regardless of construct. Maximum displacement of each construct during cyclic testing was <1.1 mm. In single cycle testing, the observed yield point did not reveal any difference between LCP and LCP-SSC (p =.440). The maximum load at failure was significantly higher in LCP-SSC compared to constructs with the LCP alone (p =.046). Conclusion: The addition of the SSC to the LCP did not statistically affect construct displacement during cyclic loading or construct yield load during subsequent single cycle to failure. Clinical significance: This study provided much needed information regarding the necessity of a tension band SSC application in the arthrodesis of the MCP/MTP joint in horses. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine if targeted blocking of frontal and infratrochlear nerves provided anesthesia for the approach to a frontonasal sinusotomy. Study design: Two part study: Part 1 randomized crossover design; Part 2 proof of concept. Animals: N = 12; six each in Parts 1 and 2. Methods: Part 1: Each horse had either frontal and infratrochlear nerve blocks or a line block performed with 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride. Mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNT) were obtained at five sites along a proposed frontonasal sinusotomy prior to injection, and at 10, 60, and 120 min after blocking. After a 4 day washout period, the opposite procedure was performed. Order of procedure and side of face were randomized. MNTs were analyzed using mixed-model ANOVA with p <.05. Part 2: Frontal and infratrochlear nerve blocks were performed followed by creation of a skin/periosteal incision, which was closed at 2 h. Ability to create and suture the incision, and the size of the incision were recorded. Results: For part 1, both line and targeted blocks resulted in at least two times an increase in median MNT values at each of the five sites, as compared to baseline MNT values (p <.0025). In Part 2, incisions could be completed in five of six horses, with median incision size of 6.5 × 5 cm. Conclusion: Following frontal and infratrochlear nerve blocks, MNTs were increased along a proposed frontonasal sinusotomy, and skin incisions could be created in the majority of horses. Clinical significance: Frontal and infratrochlear nerve blocks provide an alternative technique to create a frontonasal sinusotomy. © 2023 The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Chronic tendon and ligament diseases are commonly encountered in both athletic humans and animals, especially horses. Distal limb diseases, including suspensory ligament (SL) pathology due to anatomical, histological, and biomechanical properties, can be considered a model for tendon and ligament pathologies in humans. The appropriate selection of therapy is often crucial in optimising the healing process. One decisive factor influencing the possibility of returning to pre-disease training levels appears to be the utilisation of physical activity, including controlled movement, during the rehabilitation process. In the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal diseases and rehabilitation, adipocytokines play diverse roles. However, it is unclear what significance they hold in horses and in specific disease entities as well as the consequences of their mutual interactions. Recent studies indicate that in the pathogenesis of diseases with varied aetiologies in humans, their value varies at different stages, resulting in a diverse response to treatment. The results of this study demonstrate lower resistin concentrations in the venous blood plasma of horses with proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD), while higher levels were observed in regularly trained and paddocked animals. The horses investigated in this study showed higher concentrations of resistin and IL-8, particularly in paddocked horses as well as in the working group of horses. The results suggest that these concentrations, including resistin in blood plasma, may be clinically significant. This attempt to explore the aetiopathogenesis of the processes occurring in the area of the proximal attachment of the suspensory ligament may optimise the procedures for the treatment and rehabilitation of horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The study’s objective was to evaluate the feasibility and dispersion of an open approach to the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in eight adult equine cadavers. A ventral midline incision was made, starting 2 cm cranial to the umbilicus and extending 25 cm cranially. In total, 0.5 mL/kg of new methylene blue (NMB) was injected per horse, divided into six injections. Using an 18 g, 8 cm Tuohy needle, three injections were made per side. The needle was guided blindly into the TAP using palpation. A 60 mL syringe was attached directly to the needle, depositing ~0.08 mL/kg at each site. The time to complete the injections was recorded for each cadaver. Following injection, the ventral body wall was dissected to determine if the dye was present within the TAP space as well as to measure the extent of the dispersion of the dye, the cranial to caudal extent, and the width of the dye’s spread. Complete deposition of NMB into the TAP (six of six sites) was achieved in 5/8 horses. The median time needed to perform all the injections was 263 s. Increased adiposity (retroperitoneal fat) was associated with unsuccessful injections. This approach to the TAP was easily and quickly performed, though less successful in horses with increased retroperitoneal fat and increased BCS. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Dental malocclusions are commonly encountered in horses. The objective of this study was to report the normal cephalometric values from skull computed tomography (CT) scans of adult Straight Egyptian Arabian (SEAR) and thoroughbred (TB) horses and to compare differences in the measurements between the two breeds. Standing skull CTs were performed on 29 clinically normal adult horses (15 SEAR; 14 TB) and cephalometric measurements were taken. All 9 cephalometric measurements, as well as the interincisal angle, were found to be significantly greater in TB than SEAR (P < 0.05). TB were found to have significantly greater facial line: mandibular length (FL/ML) ratios compared to SEAR (P = 0.002) whereas for the maxillary cheek teeth length: ethmoidal line ratio (Mxa/EtL), SEAR were found to have significantly greater values than TB (P = 0.0007). SEAR cephalometric measurements, as well as certain ratios, differ significantly from TB and could have an impact on the development of dental malocclusions in this breed. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether these cephalometric differences between the two breeds predispose the SEAR to the development of dental malocclusions. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Mapping-out baseline physiological muscle parameters with their metabolic blueprint across multiple archetype equine breeds, will contribute to better understanding their functionality, even across species. Aims: 1) to map out and compare the baseline fiber type composition, fiber type and mean fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA, mfCSA) and metabolic blueprint of three muscles in 3 different breeds 2) to study possible associations between differences in histomorphological parameters and baseline metabolism. Methods: Muscle biopsies [m. pectoralis (PM), m. vastus lateralis (VL) and m. semitendinosus (ST)] were harvested of 7 untrained Friesians, 12 Standardbred and 4 Warmblood mares. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on the VL and PM of Friesian and Warmblood horses and the VL of Standardbreds using UHPLC/MS/MS and GC/MS. Breed effect on fiber type percentage and fCSA and mfCSA was tested with Kruskal-Wallis. Breeds were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with Bonferroni correction. Spearman correlation explored the association between the metabolic blueprint and morphometric parameters. Results: The ST was least and the VL most discriminative across breeds. In Standardbreds, a significantly higher proportion of type IIA fibers was represented in PM and VL. Friesians showed a significantly higher representation of type IIX fibers in the PM. No significant differences in fCSA were present across breeds. A significantly larger mfCSA was seen in the VL of Standardbreds. Lipid and nucleotide super pathways were significantly more upregulated in Friesians, with increased activity of short and medium-chain acylcarnitines together with increased abundance of long chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Standardbreds showed highly active xenobiotic pathways and high activity of long and very long chain acylcarnitines. Amino acid metabolism was similar across breeds, with branched and aromatic amino acid sub-pathways being highly active in Friesians. Carbohydrate, amino acid and nucleotide super pathways and carnitine metabolism showed higher activity in Warmbloods compared to Standardbreds. Conclusion: Results show important metabolic differences between equine breeds for lipid, amino acid, nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism and in that order. Mapping the metabolic profile together with morphometric parameters provides trainers, owners and researchers with crucial information to develop future strategies with respect to customized training and dietary regimens to reach full potential in optimal welfare.

ABSTRACT: In North America, range constraints due to burgeoning development increasingly encroach on wild horse habitat and necessitate effective but humane reproductive management. The largest free-roaming wild horse fertility control program by population (>3500) and territory size (≈300,000 acres) is located within Nevada’s Virginia Range. Data from a field study investigated porcine zona pellucida (pZP) immunocontraception via remote dart delivery to mares in this population. Analyses aimed to measure efficacy by treatment effects on annual birth rates and population demographics and to evaluate treatment frequency and season against these variables. Analyses included mares’ monthly data (January 2019–December 2022; 48 months), characterized by cumulative vaccination numbers subset into four classifications considering the vaccine as having no loss of efficacy or a loss within a 6-, 12-, and 18-month period post vaccination; from foaling data, the likelihood of being in foal and of conceiving in that month; and from age, as mature or immature (<1 years-old). A downward foaling rate and trend in the numbers of mature mares, descriptively presented at monthly intervals, showed markedly declining annual seasonal breeding peaks, with no observed change in foaling season or duration. Within four years, population coverage surpassed 70% and was associated with a 58% reduction in foaling, with only a 10% conception rate. Vaccinated mares increased proportionally: assuming a 12-month decay rate, the system reached stability at an average ≈1.0 vaccination/mare/year, providing a robust recommendation for treatment frequency contributing to best management practices. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Type I collagen is commonly recognized as the gold standard biomaterial for the manufacturing of medical devices for health-care related applications. In recent years, with the final aim of developing scaffolds with optimal bioactivity, even more studies focused on the influence of processing parameters on collagen properties, since processing can strongly affect the architecture of collagen at various length scales and, consequently, scaffolds macroscopic performances. The ability to finely tune scaffold properties in order to closely mimic the tissues' hierarchical features, preserving collagen's natural conformation, is actually of great interest. In this work, the effect of the pepsin-based extraction step on the material final properties was investigated. Thus, the physico-chemical properties of fibrillar type I collagens upon being extracted under various conditions were analyzed in depth. Correlations of collagen structure at the supramolecular scale with its microstructural properties were done, confirming the possibility of tuning rheological, viscoelastic and degradation properties of fibrillar type I collagen. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The objectives of this research was to study the sedation and anaesthetic characteristics of intravenous xylazine and dexmedetomidine combined with ketamine-midazolam-isoflurane and to evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects during the anaesthetic period. Stallions were premedicated with xylazine (1.1 mg/kg IV) in Group 1 and dexmedetomidine (3.5 μg/kg IV) in Group 2. Sedation quality was evaluated and scored. General anaesthesia was achieved with ketamine (2.2 mg/kg IV) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV) in both groups and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane inhalant in fresh oxygen gas flow (6-8 L/min). All the stallions underwent an orchiectomy by the half-closed method. Cardiovascular variables and pulmonary variables were recorded using multi gas vital sign monitor. Anaesthetic parameters, reflex status and quality of muscle relaxation were assessed. After the surgical procedure, recovery was monitored and scored on 6 point scale. Sedation score and quality was clinically better in Group 2. The difference in cardiopulmonary variables was statistically not significant. However, statistically significant changes were noticed between two groups with regard to some blood gas values during the intra-operative and at 15 min post anaesthetic period. Quality of muscle relaxation was better in group 2. Recovery was not significant. Overall quality of anaesthesia and recovery was almost similar in both the groups. In conclusion, both drug combinations produced satisfactory results for castration in the horses studied. In this study, dexmedetomidine at 3.5 μg/kg and xylazine at 1.1 mg/kg sedative doses did not result in much significant changes compared to one other. © 2024 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

ABSTRACT: With the implementation of the green development strategy and the “double carbon goal”, as an important energy for sustainable development, wind power has been widely researched and vigorously developed across the world. Wind speed prediction has a major impact on the grid dispatching of wind power connection. Most current studies only focus on the deterministic prediction of wind speed. However, the traditional deterministic forecast only provides the single wind speed prediction results and cannot meet the diverse demands of dispatchers. To bridge the gap, a wind speed point-interval forecasting method is proposed that utilizes empirical wavelet transform, an improved wild horse optimization algorithm, a multi-predictor, and improved kernel density estimation. This method decomposes the wind speed sequence into stationary subsequences through empirical wavelet transform, and then optimizes three basic learners with completely different learning mechanisms to form an ensemble model using the modified wild horse optimization algorithm. Finally, the uncertainty is analysed using an improved kernel density estimation. The datasets of three sites from America’s national renewable energy laboratory are used for comparison experiments with other models, and the predictions are discussed from different angles. The simulation results demonstrate that the model can produce high-precision deterministic results and high-quality probabilistic results. The reference information the model provides can be extremely valuable for scheduling operators. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the radiographic thickness of the dorsal hoof wall in normal draft horse feet. ANIMALS 33 adult draft horses with no history of laminitis, no clinically obvious lameness, and visibly unremarkable front feet were included. METHODS This was a prospective, descriptive study of clinically normal draft horses’ front feet. Lateromedial radiographs were acquired of the front feet. A ratio of the dorsal hoof wall thickness to the length of the distal phalanx (DHWP3 ratio) was calculated. RESULTS The dorsal hoof wall thickness to length of the distal phalanx was calculated as 0.33 ± 0.03 (range of 0.28 to 0.39) in this population of draft horses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE With very few exceptions, the heterogeneous population of draft horses evaluated in this study had a DHWP3 ratio greater than previously published values in lighter breeds (< 0.30). © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Background: Standard thoracic auscultation suffers from limitations, and no systematic analysis of breath sounds in asthmatic horses exists. Objectives: First, characterize breath sounds in horses recorded using a novel digital auscultation device (DAD). Second, use DAD to compare breath variables and occurrence of adventitious sounds in healthy and asthmatic horses. Animals: Twelve healthy control horses (ctl), 12 horses with mild to moderate asthma (mEA), 10 horses with severe asthma (sEA) (5 in remission [sEA−], and 5 in exacerbation [sEA+]). Methods: Prospective multicenter case-control study. Horses were categorized based on the horse owner-assessed respiratory signs index. Each horse was digitally auscultated in 11 locations simultaneously for 1 hour. One-hundred breaths per recording were randomly selected, blindly categorized, and statistically analyzed. Results: Digital auscultation allowed breath sound characterization and scoring in horses. Wheezes, crackles, rattles, and breath intensity were significantly more frequent, higher (P <.001, P <.01, P =.01, P <.01, respectively) in sEA+ (68.6%, 66.1%, 17.7%, 97.9%, respectively), but not in sEA− (0%, 0.7%, 1.3%, 5.6%) or mEA (0%, 1.0%, 2.4%, 1.7%) horses, compared to ctl (0%, 0.6%, 1.8%, −9.4%, respectively). Regression analysis suggested breath duration and intensity as explanatory variables for groups, wheezes for tracheal mucus score, and breath intensity and wheezes for the 23-point weighted clinical score (WCS23). Conclusions and Clinical Importance.: The DAD permitted characterization and quantification of breath variables, which demonstrated increased adventitious sounds in sEA+. Analysis of a larger sample is needed to determine differences among ctl, mEA, and sEA− horses. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial stewardship has shown significant development in recent years. Perioperative prophylaxis accounts for a substantial volume of antimicrobial use and is a field in which improvements can likely be made. The objective of this study was to evaluate practices associated with perioperative antimicrobial use in equine elective laparoscopy at a single institution over a 21-year period and to determine whether antimicrobial therapy influenced the occurrence of postoperative complications. Medical records of horses that underwent elective laparoscopy at a teaching hospital from January 2000 to September 2021 were reviewed. Data obtained included signalment, surgeon, type and duration of procedure, perioperative antimicrobial use, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Exact univariate logistic regression was used to explore the association between possible risk factors and occurrence of postoperative complications, as well as the association between year of presentation and time of antimicrobial administration. Duration of surgery was log-transformed to meet assumption of normality, followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare mean surgery time per procedure and postoperative complications. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Sixty horses met the inclusion criteria. All horses received antimicrobial prophylaxis, but none received intraoperative redosing. Only 13 horses (26%) received antimicrobials within 60 min of the first incision. Time of administration improved with each year of the study (P = 0.005). Only 17 horses (28%) received antimicrobials for less than 24 h, but median duration of antimicrobial therapy was 1.25 d (range: 0.25 to 10 d). Antimicrobial use practices at this institution differed from general recommendations for optimal perioperative prophylaxis, which suggests that intervention is required. © 2024, Canadian Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: An owner-completed questionnaire was designed to monitor the level of chronic pain and impact on quality of life in horses with osteoarthritis (OA). A standardized approach to develop and validate subjective-state scales for clinical use was followed. Scale items were generated through literature review, focus group meetings, and expert panel evaluation. The draft tool was tested for reading level and language ambiguity and piloted in 25 owners/caregivers of horses with osteoarthritis, with factor analysis performed on responses. The resulting revised questionnaire is currently undergoing validation in a larger sample population of 60 OA and 20 sound control horses. In the pilot group, 21 people (84%) found the questionnaire easy to complete and 22 people (88%) found it useful. It could be completed within 5 min by all participants. Readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch–Kincaid grade level, SMOG index) indicated an English language reading level comparable to that of 6th to 7th grade in the U.S. system (age 11–12 years). Cronbach’s alpha of all items in the tool was 0.957, indicating excellent inter-item correlation. Interim analysis for 23 OA horses from the sample population showed good test–retest reliability and higher scores compared to 5 control horses. Full validation must be completed for the instrument to be used in clinical practice. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Scientifically validated and standardised methods for the evaluation of the welfare of free-living horses are urgently needed by both the owners and managers of these populations and those responsible for implementing national welfare legislation. The aim of the study was to test the feasibility and usefulness of two welfare protocols that could be applied to semi-feral populations: a prototype of welfare assessment template (WAT) for Carneddau semi-feral ponies and the IFCE/INRAE Horse Welfare Protocol. Additionally, the body condition scale designed by Henneke (BCS-H) was employed. The study took place in July/August 2022 and April 2023 to evaluate the welfare of a pilot population of nineteen semi-feral Konik polski horses. The horses scored high or satisfactory under indicators across both protocols; only body condition scores were significantly lower in early spring (BCS-WAT: 1.11 ± 0.57; BCS-H: 3.84 ± 1.17) than in the summer (BCS-WAT: 1.58 ± 0.61; BCS-H: 5.63 ± 1.01). Our study confirmed the feasibility of utilising most of the WAT and IFCE/INRAE welfare indicators in semi-feral horses. Some adaptations, such as considering validation of scales, positive welfare indicators and animals’ free-choice of conditions, have been suggested for future in-field application. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to develop a robust machine-learning approach for efficient detection and grading of sesamoiditis in horses using radiographs, specifically in data-limited conditions. SAMPLE A dataset of 255 dorsolateral-palmaromedial oblique (DLPMO) and dorsomedial-palmarolateral oblique (DMPLO) equine radiographs were retrospectively acquired from Hagyard Equine Medical Institute. These images were anonymized and classified into 3 categories of sesamoiditis severity (normal, mild, and moderate). METHODS This study was conducted from February 1, 2023, to August 31, 2023. Two RetinaNet models were used in a cascaded manner, with a self-attention module incorporated into the second RetinaNet’s classification subnetwork. The first RetinaNet localized the sesamoid bone in the radiographs, while the second RetinaNet graded the severity of sesamoiditis based on the localized region. Model performance was evaluated using the confusion matrix and average precision (AP). RESULTS The proposed model demonstrated a promising classification performance with 92.7% accuracy, surpassing the base RetinaNet model. It achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 81.8%, indicating superior object detection ability. Notably, performance metrics for each severity category showed significant improvement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The proposed deep learning-based method can accurately localize the position of sesamoid bones and grade the severity of sesamoiditis on equine radiographs, providing corresponding confidence scores. This approach has the potential to be deployed in a clinical environment, improving the diagnostic interpretation of metacarpophalangeal (fetlock) joint radiographs in horses. Furthermore, by expanding the training dataset, the model may learn to assist in the diagnosis of pathologies in other skeletal regions of the horse. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to determine the perception of sustainability among horse owners in the Netherlands and their willingness to switch to more sustainable feeding practices. A survey was distributed to a target group of horse owners in the Netherlands via social media channels. Data (n = 338 valid responses) were stratified based on yard type and size (small (<20), medium (20-50), and large (>50 horses). Most of the yards were livery yards (68 %) and they were small in size (66 %). The term most commonly associated with sustainability was low environmental impact (61.8 %). All participants (338/338) indicated that they were willing to switch to more sustainable feeding practices. Of the six options offered, the most popular was the use of plastic-free packaging products (60.5 %). This study identified that numerically the greatest change in behavior for the Dutch equestrian community would be achieved by small livery yards (P < 0.001). The potential to modify certain practices might be limited by the size of the equestrian operation, such as the available land for altering pasture management, and the financial aspects of the enterprise. Future research should investigate how the scale and economic considerations of the equestrian business influence its capacity and willingness to adopt more sustainable feeding practices. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Seeking the improvement of equine sports medicine, the present work aimed to determine quantitative data from different bone structures. Therefore, the objective of this work was to quantify the thickness of the cortex in a comparative way to determine the bone densitometry and also the bone density of the bone trabeculae of the spongy substance of the radius, calcaneus, and metacarpal III bones of horses practicing equestrian enduro long-distance running tests. Six thoroughbred Arabian horses and long-distance competitors (120 and 160km) were evaluated for metacarpal III, calcaneus, and accessory carpal bone. Long bones have a different micro functional structure than short bones. The sites that received and dissipated energy varied in distal, proximal epiphysis, and diaphysis according to the bone. The calcaneus and accessory carpal bone had a lower transverse thickness of the compact substance and greater density of the same, this increase was related to the improvement of local resistance. The density of the spongy substance varied with different bones. Thus, it was concluded that stress directly influenced the quantity and quality of the compact and spongy substance. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais). All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel has been suggested for wound repair. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its usage in animals with cutaneous wounds. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of PRP gel on cutaneous wound healing in rescued horses. Twelve horses were divided into two groups: group A (PRP-treated) and group B (control). The group A (n=6) animals were treated with autologous PRP gel, while the group B (n=6) animals were treated with sterile saline. Full-thickness (3 x 3 cm2) skin wounds were selected in each horse on either left or right region of back. Neovascularization was assessed on days 14 and 28 by color Doppler ultrasonography and cytokeratin staining. Wound re-epithelialization and the number of fibroblasts were assessed by cytokeratin staining. All data were statistically analyzed. We observed that PRP-wounds had highly significantly (P<0.01) increased levels of neovascularization on days 14 and 28 than control wounds. PRP-wounds had highly significant (P<0.01) increases in re-epithelialization levels and fibroblast numbers at days 14 and 28 than control wounds. In conclusion, PRP-treated wounds accelerated cutaneous wound healing by fostering re-epithelialization and neovascularization in rescued horses than control wounds. Therefore, this study suggests the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel to treat cutaneous wounds in rescued horses, which is a safe and effective method. The color Doppler ultrasonography can be used to assess neovascularization during wound healing. Copyright 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonists, particularly resveratrol (RES), have not been extensively evaluated for their effect on insulin dysregulation (ID) in horses. Objectives: Evaluate the effects of treatment with RES (10 mg/kg PO q12h), metformin (MET; 30 mg/kg PO q12h), and aspirin (ASP; 20 mg/kg PO q24h) on experimentally induced ID. Animals: Thirty-three healthy, adult, light-breed horses. Methods: Unblinded, placebo-controlled, experimental trial evaluating effects of AMPK agonists (RES, MET, and ASP) on experimentally induced ID. Horses were randomly assigned to a treatment group (RES, MET/ASP, RES/ASP, RES/MET/ASP, or placebo [CON]) after induction of ID with dexamethasone (0.08 mg/kg PO q24h for 7 days). Frequently sampled insulin-modified IV glucose tolerance tests (FSIGTT) and oral sugar tests (OST) were performed at baseline, 7 days after ID, and ID plus 7 days of treatment. Minimal model and OST variables were compared between (1-way ANOVA) and within (1-way ANOVA for repeated measures) groups over time to determine effects of treatment on ID. Results: Administration of dexamethasone for 14 days resulted in significantly altered insulin and glucose dynamics (SI, DI, basal [glucose], and [insulin]) and produced clinical signs of laminitis in 5 out of 33 (15%) of horses included in the study. Combination therapy with RES, MET, and ASP did not significantly improve insulin and glucose dynamics in horses with experimentally induced ID. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Metabolic testing before glucocorticoid administration should be considered in horses with clinical signs of metabolic syndrome. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The article presents the results of monitoring studies on the mucous membrane lesions in Trakehner horses. Based on clinical examination, the localization, size, and number of ulcers, as well as the inflammatory reaction to the presence of necrotic tissue, were determined. In addition to clinical examination, planimetric studies were also carried out to determine the size of the ulcers and the dynamics of their reduction during treatment with aerosol application of PVP iodine spray. To determine the nature of inflammation in the lesion focus, smears were taken from the surface of the ulcers. Microbiological and mycological studies of pathological tissues and feed samples were carried out to establish the etiological factors contributing to the ulcers. It was found that the size of the ulcers varied from 1 to 6 cm, and they were located on the upper and lower lips on both the right and left sides. Neutrophilic leukocytosis was observed in the focus of inflammation. Leukocytes actively phagocytized microorganisms present in the pathological focus. Microscopic fungi of the species A. flavus, A. fumigatus, M. species, and P. commune sprouted on Saburo medium from necrotic tissues of the pathological focus. A similar composition of fungal species was obtained by sowing feed samples fed to horses. Microbiological studies of ulcers revealed the growth of two microorganisms, S. aureus and P. vulgaris, on Baird-Parker agar. On the third day of treatment, compared to the first day, the size of the ulcers decreased by 22.8 %. It is recommended to perform primary surgical treatment of the ulcer, apply PVP iodine spray once a day, and replace the affected feed with high-quality feed to achieve a positive therapeutic effect. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

ABSTRACT: The paper summarises the importance of body language as the basis of communication between humans and horses. Understanding horse body language is crucial for successful communication. Horses in communication use their entire body from head to tail and will respond to even the smallest signs made by their human companions. Accordingly, humans should be aware of their body language and pay close attention to body language communication when working with horses. In this sense, there is also a need to increase research on equine welfare during human-horse interactions, assessing not only the negative but also their positive affective states. © 2024, Croatian Veterinary Institute.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the agreement between the Tafonius large animal ventilator-integrated volumetric capnography (vCap) software and the Respironics NICO noninvasive cardiac output monitor reference system. ANIMALS Data were collected from 56 healthy adult horses undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS Animals were placed under general anesthesia and connected to the Tafonius large animal ventilator circle system. A flow partitioning device with CO2 and flow sensors was utilized to couple the endotracheal tube to the NICO monitor. Tafonius CO2 and flow sensors are incorporated into the Y-piece of the breathing circuit. Arterial blood samples were collected to determine the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) immediately before data collection. The PaCO2 was input into the Tafonius and NICO monitor, and dead space ventilation (%Vd), end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (ETco2), mixed-expired CO2 partial pressure (Peco2), and expired tidal volume (Vt) were calculated over a single breath. Multiple measurements were completed for each patient, with a total of 200 paired data points collected for analysis. Data were assessed for normality, and Bland-Altman analysis was performed. Bias and 95% limits of agreement were calculated. RESULTS The limits of agreement for %Vd of the ventilator-derived measurements fell within ± 10% of the NICO monitor reference method. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our results indicate that, when compared to the NICO monitor method, the Tafonius-integrated vCap software provides clinically acceptable values of Peco2, Vt, and %Vd in healthy adult horses. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature and time of sous-vide cooking method on the characteristics of Thoroughbred horse loin. Sliced portions (200 ± 50 g) were cooked by boiling (control) and sous-vide (65 and 70 °C for 12, 18, and 24 h). The samples were analyzed for proximate composition, pH, color, texture, microstructure, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), microbiology, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nucleotide content, and fatty acids composition. The color analysis showed decreased redness at elevated temperatures. Improved tenderness, demonstrated by reduced shear force values (36.36 N at 65 °C for 24 h and 35.70 N at 70 °C for 24 h). The micrographs indicated dense fiber arrangements at 70 °C. The SDS-PAGE revealed muscle protein degradation with extended sous-vide cooking. The VOC analysis identified specific compounds, potentially distinctive markers for sous-vide cooking of horse meat including 1-octen-3-ol, decanal, n-caproic acid vinyl ester, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl, and 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-epoxybutane. This study highlights the cooking time’s primary role in sous vide-cooked horse meat tenderness and proposes specific VOCs as potential markers. Further research should explore the exclusivity of these VOCs to sous-vide cooking. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Scientifically sound studies investigating the influence of riders on the physiological responses of riding horses are rare. Therefore, this pilot study was aimed to investigate the physiological changes in 6 purebred Lipizzan horses during an exercise test (ExT) in an indoor arena performed by a male and a female rider with different body weights and experience levels. Respiratory rate, rectal and body surface temperature, lactate, creatinine, and cortisol concentrations were measured before (BEx) and after exercise tests (AEx) with a graded workload, while heart rate and speed were recorded telemetrically during the ExT. Measured values were within a range for warmblooded animals and increased significantly (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) in both riders AEx. BST values were highest in the cranial regions of the horses, followed by the caudal and distal body regions (P < 0.001). The differences in values were insignificant (P > 0.05) between the two ExTs, except the higher heart rate between the male and the female rider (P < 0.05). The results of this study indicate that there are no influences of rider characteristics on the physiological responses of riding horses and point to the importance of further research in the field of equine exercise testing, sports medicine, and animal welfare, which will also provide necessary knowledge for the conservation and development of the Lipizzan breed. © 2024 Brill Wageningen Academic.

ABSTRACT: Sarcopenia, the age-related muscle atrophy, is a serious concern as it is associated with frailty, reduced physical functions, and increased mortality risk. Protein supplementation is essential for preserving muscle mass, and horse meat can be an excellent source of proteins. Since sarcopenia occurs under conditions of oxidative stress, this study aimed to investigate the potential anti-muscle atrophy effect of horse meat hydrolysate using C2C12 cells. A horse meat hydrolysate less than 3 kDa (A4<3kDa) significantly increased the viability of C2C12 myoblasts against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Exposure of C2C12 myoblasts to lipopolysaccharide led to an elevation of cellular reactive oxygen species levels and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6, and these effects were attenuated by A4<3kDa treatment. Additionally, A4<3kDa activated protein synthesis-related proteins through the protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway, while decreasing the expression of activity and degradation-related proteins, such as Forkhead box O3, muscle RING finger protein-1, and Atrogin-1 in dexamethasone-treated C2C12 myotubes. Therefore, the natural material A4<3kDa has the potential of protecting against muscle atrophy, while further in vivo study is needed. © 2024 Korean Society for Food Science of Animal Resources.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to compare the sedative and cardiovascular effects of the combination of acepromazine-clonidine versus acepromazine-xylazine in horses. Four healthy cross-bred horses were included in the study. They were assigned to two treatments. In treatment I (T1), the animals received xylazine hydrochloride (1.00 mg kg-1) in combination with acepromazine maleate (0.05 mg kg-1) intravenously (IV). In treatment II (T2), the animals received intra-gastric administration of clonidine (0.002 mg kg-1) followed by acepromazine (0.05 mg kg-1; IV) after 60 min. Head height above the ground (HHAG) and echocardiographic indices were evaluated. In T1, recordings were made 5 min before and 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after drug administration. In T2, recordings were made 5 min before clonidine, 55 min after clonidine administration, and then 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after acepromazine injection. Analyses of the data showed there were not significant differences regarding HHAG and echo-cardiographic indices between two treatments. For sedation of healthy horses, it was concluded that intra-gastric administration of clonidine and IV administration of acepromazine showed similar sedative and cardiovascular effects compared to IV acepromazine-xylazine administration. © 2024 Urmia University.

ABSTRACT: Horse traits under selection are largely quantitative and affected by multiple genes. Horse face shape is an example of a continuous trait, which due to the reliance on observational assessments, is classified into; “dished”, “straight”, and “roman-nosed”. This categorization is often inadequate to convey the full spectrum of the face shape variation especially for genetic studies. The first objective of the current study was to use geometric morphometric methods to quantitatively phenotype face shapes and examine its variation across horse breeds. The second objective was to analyze the face shape variation within Arabian horses since face shape is (1) favored, valued, and genetically selected in certain lineages (e.g. Egyptian), (2) is evaluated by registries and scored in shows, and (3) in its extreme forms pose health concerns. We digitized landmarks on lateral profile photos, particularly on the dorsal curvature of the rostrum, and subjected these landmarks to Generalized Procrustes Analysis to generate independent shape and size variables which were statistically compared across breeds and within Arabians. Horse breeds varied in nasal curvature, ranging from extremely concave to extremely convex, with over 70 % of horse breeds exhibiting intermediate concavity (i.e., straight profile). Interestingly, Arabian horses possessed the highest diversity in face profile and individuals clustered into three distinct shape sub-groups (one dished and two straight profile clusters). Our quantitative phenotyping method can be the basis of future genetic studies of facial profile within Arabian lineages as a favored traits and potentially manage its extreme forms as a likely genetic disease. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Reducing inhaled dust particles improves lung function in horses with severe asthma. Soaked hay is commonly used by owners, but its efficacy in improving lung function and inflammation has not been documented. Objectives: To measure the effects of soaked hay and alfalfa pellets in horses with severe asthma. Animals: Ten adult horses with severe asthma from a research colony. Methods: Prospective controlled trial. Horses in clinical exacerbation were housed indoors and allocated to be fed either soaked hay (n = 5) or alfalfa pellets (n = 5) for 6 weeks. Soaked hay was immersed for 45 minutes and dried out hay was discarded between meals. Pulmonary function and clinical scores were measured before and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. Tracheal mucus scores and bronchoalveolar lavages were performed before and after 6 weeks. Lung function was analyzed with a linear mixed model using log-transformed data. Results: Lung resistance decreased from (median (range)) 2.47 (1.54-3.95) to 1.59 (0.52-2.10) cmH2O/L/s in the pellets group and from 1.89 (1.2-3.54) to 0.61 (0.42-2.08) cmH2O/L/s in the soaked hay group over the 6-week period for an average difference of 1.06 cmH2O/L/s for pellets (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.09-2.04, P =.03, not significant after correction) and 1.31 cmH2O/L/s for soaked hay (95% CI: −0.23 to 2.85, P <.001, significant). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Soaked hay can control airway obstruction in horses with severe asthma. The strict protocol for soaking and discarding dried-out hay in this study could however be considered too great of an inconvenience by owners. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess the efficacy of commercial intra-articular blood-derived allogeneic-induced mesenchymal stem cells (CIMSCs) to treat tarsometatarsal lameness in horses. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Animals: Records from 167 adult light breed horses with bilateral tarsometatarsal lameness. Methods: Horses with tarsometatarsal lameness were retrospectively selected from medical records. Diagnosis followed subjective graded lameness assessment before and after intra-articular analgesia, with graded radiographic tarsal examination. Horses were excluded if they were diagnosed or treated for any other concurrent lameness conditions during the study. Time to last follow-up and time of recurrence of lameness was recorded at veterinary re-assessment. Results: A total of 67 horses were recruited to the CIMSC-treated group and 100 to the corticosteroid (CS)-treated group. Median age was 9 years, with no difference in signalment, use or radiographic grade between groups. First re-examination was 38 days (95% CI: 38–49), with no difference between groups, CIMSC 42 (35–45), control 34 (25–42). Median follow-up was 438 days for CIMSC, 546 for controls. Symptoms of lameness recurred in 86/100 controls compared to 17/67 (25%) CIMSC. Median time to lameness recurring in CIMSC was 336 days (95% CI: 239–400), control 90 days (95% CI: 80–108), p <.0001. Cox proportional hazard ratio for treatment was 8.35, 95% CI: 4.67 to 14.92, p <.0001. Conclusions: Lameness was abolished in all treated horses. It recurred significantly less often, and later, in CIMSC-treated horses. Clinical significance: Intra-articular CIMSC treatment results in prolonged soundness in horses with tarsometatarsal lameness. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Aesculus indica, the Indian Horse Chestnut (IHCN), is a wild tree species indigenous to the temperate forests of the Himalayas. The seeds of this tree are abundant in carbohydrates but are not edible because they contain a very significant quantity of bitter saponins. Indigenous tribes in the Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh possess a unique traditional knowledge of separating saponins and other impurities from starch. Once this process is over, the resultant product is used as food and medicine. The starch complex, locally known as Seek, is used to prepare several dishes for auspicious occasions. Seek is used as a noncereal diet during fasting, and to keep young children and the elderly warm during the chilly winter months. The local population utilizes the seeds to treat ailments like joint pain, fatigue, diabetes, venous insufficiency, phlebitis, hemorrhoids, ulcers, thrombosis, colic, etc. IHCN has a high energy value, superior starch quality, and a variety of secondary metabolites. These qualities make it a promising raw material for the nutraceutical, functional food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. The utilization of plant components through local indigenous knowledge, as well as their distribution, botany, and ecology, have been described in the present study. Inventorization of the production and productivity of the tree, selection of better and high-yielding germplasm, mechanized processing, value addition, and popularization would be helpful to develop sustainable management practices for IHCN and improve the livelihood and nutritional security of the tribal population residing in the remote localities of Western Himalayas. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Hippotherapy is considered as a beneficial field of activity for Žemaitukas, a Lithuanian native horse breed. The aim of this study is to analyze the suitability of Žemaitukas breed horses for hippotherapy by using a set of tests based on the temperament, behavioral reactions, and zoometric measurements. Results of these tests inform whether the future use of Lithuanian native horses in hippotherapy can ensure their welfare. In total, 32 horses were evaluated. Twenty-nine of the evaluated horses were horses of the Žemaitukas breed that had never been used for hippotherapy, the others were hippotherapy horses representing different breeds, which were considered the control group. As expected, control hippotherapy horses scored better in many tests, thus confirming the suitability of these tests for the evaluation of horses for hippotrapeutic use. Žemaitukas breed horses scored an average of 15.9% less points for the test of temperament and 21.3% less points for “Hippo-test” compared with the hippotherapy horses. Nevertheless, the results suggest that Žemaitukas breed horses could be used in hippotherapy after special training courses. © 2024 Lithuanian University of Health Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Immortalized cells serve as a crucial research tool that capitalizes on their robust proliferative properties for functional investigations of an organism. Establishing an immortalized American miniature horse cell line could yield valuable insights into these animals’ genetic and physiological characteristics and susceptibility to health issues. To date, immortalized small horse cells with normal karyotypes have not been established. In this study, we successfully established primary and immortalized fibroblast cell lines through the combined expression of human-derived mutant cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4R24C), cyclin D1, and Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), although CDK4R24C and cyclin D1, SV40T and TERT did not result in successful immortalization. Our comparison of the properties of these immortalized cells demonstrated that K4DT immortalized cells maintain a normal karyotype. Ultimately, our findings could pave the way for the development of targeted interventions to enhance the health and well-being of American miniature horses. Copyright 2024 Tani.

ABSTRACT: Background: Dexamethasone is routinely administered to horses but its effect on the antibody response to a commercial EIV/EHV vaccine is unclear. Hypothesis: Horses receiving dexamethasone will have lower postvaccination antibody levels against EIV and EHV-1 than vaccinated controls. Animals: Fifty-five healthy adult research horses. Methods: Randomized cohort study. Control (no vaccine, group 1), vaccination only (EIV/EHV-1/EHV-4, Prestige 2, Merck Animal Health, group 2), vaccination and concurrent single intravenous dose of dexamethasone (approximately.05 mg/kg, group 3), vaccination and 3 intravenous doses of dexamethasone at 24 hours intervals (group 4). Serum SAA levels were measured on day 1 and day 3. Antibody levels against EIV (hemagglutination inhibition assay, Kentucky 2014 antigen) and EHV-1 (multiplex ELISA targeting total IgG and IgG 4/7) were measured on day 1 and day 30. Results: Significantly increased mean antibody titers after vaccination were only noted against EIV and only after the vaccination alone (n = 14, prevaccine mean [prvm] 166.9, SD 259.6, 95% CI 16.95-316.8; postvaccine mean [povm] 249.1, SD 257.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 100.6-397.6, P =.02) and the single dose dexamethasone (n = 14, prvm 93.14, SD 72.2, CI 51.45-134.8; povm 185.1, SD 118, CI 116.7-253.6, P =.01), but not after multiple doses of dexamethasone (n = 14, prvm 194.3, SD 258.3, CI 45.16-343.4; povm 240.0, SD 235.7, CI 103.9-376.1, P >.05). Conclusion: The effect of dexamethasone on the postvaccine antibody response varies depending on the dosing frequency and the antigen-specific antibody type. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Fractures caused by bone overloading are a leading cause of euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses. The risk of fatal fracture has been shown to be influenced by both environmental and genetic factors but, to date, no specific genetic mechanisms underpinning fractures have been identified. In this study, we utilised a genome-wide polygenic risk score to establish an in vitro cell system to study bone gene regulation in horses at high and low genetic risk of fracture. Candidate gene expression analysis revealed differential expression of COL3A1 and STAT1 genes in osteoblasts derived from high- and low-risk horses. Whole-genome sequencing of two fracture cases and two control horses revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of COL3A1 that was confirmed in a larger cohort to be significantly associated with fractures. Bioinformatics tools predicted that this SNP may impact the binding of the transcription factor SOX11. Gene modulation demonstrated SOX11 is upstream of COL3A1, and the region binds to nuclear proteins. Furthermore, luciferase assays demonstrated that the region containing the SNP has promoter activity. However, the specific effect of the SNP depends on the broader genetic background of the cells and suggests other factors may also be involved in regulating COL3A1 expression. In conclusion, we have identified a novel SNP that is significantly associated with fracture risk and provide new insights into the regulation of the COL3A1 gene. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Effects of general anesthesia with controlled ventilation on the respiratory system have had limited evaluation in horses. A prospective observational study was performed with eleven client-owned horses undergoing elective surgery. Physical examination, auscultation with a rebreathing bag, complete blood cell count, lung ultrasound imaging, tracheal endoscopy imaging and transendoscopic tracheal wash were conducted before and 24 hours after anesthesia. Lung ultrasound imaging was also repeated just after recovery. A significant increase in blood neutrophil count between pre- and post-anesthesia (P=0.004) was observed. There was an increase in ultrasonographic score of the lungs at recovery (left P=0.007, right P=0.017). The score of the dependent lung was higher than the independent lung at recovery time (P=0.026) but no difference was observed 24 hours after anesthesia. The tracheal mucus score was higher after anesthesia (P=0.001); severe local inflammation was present in several horses at the site of endotracheal tube cuff. Neutrophil count was significantly higher on tracheal wash fluid cytology after anesthesia (P=0.016), without any significant changes on bacterial load. Increased tracheal mucus score and neutrophil count in tracheal wash samples were observed after general anesthesia in healthy horses without clinical evidence of pneumonia (fever, cough). Tracheal inflammation secondary to endotracheal intubation and cuff inflation was, therefore, suspected. Elective surgery without complications can induce inflammation of the trachea and changes in ultrasound images of the lungs in healthy horses and should be considered when evaluating respiratory system after a general anesthesia. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, while less advanced than in human medicine, holds significant potential in the field of veterinary medicine. This technology offers a range of essential benefits, such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, disease control, and overall animal health improvement. Based on clinical data, this study uses 15 AI models to predict the necessity of surgery and the likelihood of survival in horses displaying symptoms of acute abdominal pain (colic). By comparing surgical and survival predictions across the original, imputed missing values, and balanced datasets, we determine the most effective dataset based on the average accuracy of the 15 AI models. Furthermore, we explore the potential for improved accuracy with a reduced feature set by calculating feature importance scores for surgery and survival predictions. Our results indicate that the balanced dataset achieved the highest average accuracy for predicting surgery and survival, with 80.76% and 77.96%, respectively. The Random Forest (RF) model outperformed others as the most accurate model for both surgery (accuracy = 85.83, Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.906) and survival prediction (accuracy = 80.75, AUC = 0.888). It was observed that reducing the number of features in the dataset by 56% led to an increase in surgery prediction accuracy to 86.38%. Similarly, when the number of features was reduced by 24% for survival prediction, the prediction performance increased to 83.75%. This study emphasizes the importance of the precise implementation of artificial intelligence techniques in veterinary medicine, which can significantly enhance model performance. © 2024, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

ABSTRACT: Classifiers in machine learning work on the principle that the observations are evenly distributed across the classes. However, real-world datasets frequently exhibit skewed distributions of classes, which is called imbalanced, causing the classifiers make highly biased predictions. One of the several method groups that deal with imbalance data problem is class balancing methods. We aimed to compare some class balancing methods during the classification of pacing horses according to their origins. Data set contains morphological traits of horses and four origin classes with different sample sizes that leads a multi-class imbalanced data problem. Training data set was modified with different balancing methods. Each balanced data set was trained with C5.0, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine classifiers. Method comparisons were made based on comparison metrics using the original test set. The best prediction result was obtained on the data set balanced with random undersampling method regarding both G-mean and Matthews Correlation Coefficient; however, the best result according to F1 score was observed on the data set balanced with Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN). Primary important variables of the best models were body length, withers height, chest circumference and rump height. The Bulgarian origin was the most accurately predicted class despite having the smallest sample size. Class balancing methods clearly improved the performance of classifiers for predicting origins of pacing horses. © 2024, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Costa Rican Paso Horse (CPC) is a breed developed in Costa Rica. The objectives were to estimate the genetic structure and evaluate the levels of genetic variability of the population. The genotypes of 14 microsatellites in 3654 records (2052 females and 1602 males) were analyzed. Expected (He) and observed (Ho) heterozygosity, polymorphic information content (CIP), fixation index (FIS), Shannon index, as well as Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (DHW) were evaluated. Kinship relationships (Rij) were estimated throughout the entire population. The effective population size (Ne) was calculated, alternating allele frequencies less than 0.05, 0.02 and 0.01. The Bayesian clustering study was carried out to infer how many lines are appropriate from the analysis of genotypes using multiple loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 7 to 17, with an average value of 9.6; nine loci presented DHW (P < 0.05); two loci presented negative FIS values, the same as Ho > He; the average of CIP, Ho and He was 0.254, 0.756 and 0.785, respectively. At the 12 loci where He > Ho, the differences ranged from 0.002 to 0.341 (0.036 on average). For Ne, the estimates were 201.9, 230.1, and 241.5. In the Rij, 54.86% of the estimates were in the interval of 0.01 to 77.7%. The number of lines that define the population corresponds to three, with an approximate composition of 33.1%, 32.4% and 34.5%, respectively. The CPC, as a subdivided population with DHW and a reduction in heterozygotes may be associated with possible Wahlund effects.

ABSTRACT: Wild free-roaming (WFR) horses (Equus ferus caballus) occur on lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service in 10 western US states. Little is known about public knowledge concerning management of WFR horse populations. In 2020, we conducted a survey to assess public knowledge with the intent of establishing baseline information that may be used to shape horse management programs and policies on the nation's public lands. We obtained responses from 1 124 residents of the western United States. Our survey asked eight knowledge-based questions of WFR horse ecology and management in the western United States. We conducted chi-square analyses to determine the influence of age, gender, region of residence, and income on respondents’ ability to answer these questions appropriately. Our results indicate that these demographic characteristics had little predictive ability to explain the level of the western US public's knowledge of WFR horse ecology and management (for all comparisons, λ < 0.10). Furthermore, our respondents had little knowledge of WFR ecology and management. Approximately 30% of respondents correctly identified WFR horse origins, 8% correctly indicated WFR horse population size, and 37.5% indicated that they were unaware of legal management options. The lack of basic understanding of WFR horse ecology and management may influence the public's ability to support management efforts or determine fact from propaganda. Approximately 60% of the respondents indicated they primarily used government, university, and organization websites when seeking information. Efforts to increase dissemination of facts on multiple venues, such as social media, websites, and newspapers that link back to government and university websites, could increase public support of future management actions. Additionally, the announcement of management actions, such as round-ups, should consistently include basic background information regarding WFR horse ecology and populations to ensure that the public can make informed conclusions. © 2023 The Society for Range Management

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral cannabidiol (CBD) administration in addition to a conventional analgesic protocol on the clinical signs of 20 horses with mild joint osteoarthritis. The horses were randomly assigned to either the control group (C group) or the cannabidiol group (CBD group). Both groups were treated with phenylbutazone for 5 days. The CBD group received 0.03 mg/kg cannabidiol in hemp oil orally once daily for 14 days in addition to phenylbutazone treatment. All subjects were monitored for clinical parameters, oxidative status and blood counts. Pain and quality of life were also assessed using the Horse Chronic Pain Scale (HCPS). The CBD group showed a significant reduction in heart rate, respiratory rate, white blood cell count and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde lipid peroxidation). A significant reduction in HCPS scores was seen in both groups. Lower scores were recorded in the CBD group (3 med; range: 2/4) than in the C group (7 med; range: 4/10). The addition of a cannabidiol-based product to an analgesic protocol was well tolerated and showed positive effects on the treated subjects, improving their quality of life and pain relief.

ABSTRACT: Dermatological clinical signs have been seldom reported in the literature secondary to equine leishmaniasis. This case depicts the clinical signs, treatment, and outcome of a young horse with a pink, elevated lesion on the ventromedial quadrant of the cornea. A corneal cytology was performed and revealed the presence of leishmania amastigotes reaching the diagnosis of keratitis secondary to leishmania. Surgical resection was recommended but the owner declined the procedure, and the lesion was treated with a topical antimonial for 6 weeks. The lesion reduced remarkably during the first weeks of treatment. The patient had not shown recurrence of the lesion for 2 years since the treatment was started. Leishmania spp. can be responsible for ocular surface abnormalities such as keratitis. Corneal cytology is an inexpensive diagnostic method that should be considered when ocular surface abnormalities are identified in horses in endemic areas. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: A 9-y-old Mangalarga Marchador gelding was referred to a veterinary hospital because of a swelling on the upper right side of the neck. Ultrasound examination revealed a multilocular structure adjacent to the thyroid gland with low echogenic content suggestive of fluid. The mass was removed surgically. Histologically, the cystic cavities in the surgical sample were filled with abundant eosinophilic secreta and lined by cuboidal, segmentally ciliated, columnar epithelium with interspersed goblet cells. Segmental crowding of the multilayered lining of the cyst was noted. Immunohistochemistry suggested the presence of both C cells and follicular cells, given the positivity of the immunomarkers calcitonin and TTF-1, respectively. The histogenesis of ultimobranchial cysts is uncertain. Based on clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical identification, the cystic structure in this case is compatible with an ultimobranchial body cyst. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Evolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in horses with sagittal groove disease (SGD) of the proximal phalanx is relatively sparsely described. This retrospective, descriptive, longitudinal study describes the findings of sequential low-field MRI fetlock examinations in horses with SGD of the proximal phalanx using a classification system. Twenty-nine horses were included, predominantly warmbloods used for show jumping (79%). For 29 limbs re-examined during the initial rehabilitation period, classification remained constant (n = 18), increased (n = 2), decreased (n = 7), and fluctuated (n = 2). Notably, two limbs with initial classification 4b (bone oedema-like signal with subchondral microfissure) and one with 4c (bone oedema-like signal with subchondral demineralisation) progressed to classification 5 (incomplete macrofissure/fracture), highlighting their potential as prodromal or imminent fissure pathology. Following conservative (n = 28) and surgical (n = 1) treatment, 86% of the horses re-entered full training and competition with a mean ± sd recovery time of 9.4 ± 4.4 months. In total, 20% of horses in the study subsequently presented for repeat MRI due to recurrent lameness after resuming full work, with classification that was the same (n = 2), increased (n = 2), or decreased (n = 2) compared with the last scan. This study underscores the variability in progression of SGD MRI findings, emphasising the need for further larger-scale research into patterns of progression. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the fossil horse remains from the archaeo-palaeontological layer of the Middle Pleistocene locality of Fontana Ranuccio (Central Italy) (400 ka; MIS 11), which has been long considered a reference site for the Italian biochronology from which the Fontana Ranuccio Faunal Unit has been established in the 1990s. Despite the archaeo-palaeontological importance of this locality, the material belonging to equids has never been formally described. The Fontana Ranuccio sample consists of 28 remains, in particular 25 isolated premolars and molars at different wear stages, an incomplete scapula, a complete talus and a proximal portion of a third metatarsus which belong to a large caballine horse, historically ascribed to Equus cf. E. mosbachensis. The large size and the persistence of some primitive–stenonoid sensu lato–characters in the Fontana Ranuccio teeth, together with clear advanced (caballine) morphological traits support their attribution to the polymorph group of Equus mosbachensis. The results of the revision of the Fontana Ranuccio material and the comparison with data from selected European localities are consistent with the hypothesis that the morphological and dimensional differences observed in Middle Pleistocene horses depend on the presence of ecomorphotypes and the intrinsic intra-population variability that characterises most equid species. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: IN THIS study, according to the guidelines of PRISMA, the meta-analysis on prevalence of Streptococcus species in horses with respiratory tract infections was performed. After compete search, data extraction and selection of studies, data were analyzed using comprehensive meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis of selected studies were 95% confidence intervals, effect size, heterogeneity, weight, and publication bias. A total of 1831 (32.25 %) out of 5678 diseased horses in 20 study with upper respiratory symptoms were found positive for Streptococcus species. The final meta-analysis model of the size effect and null test at fixed and random effect showed the effect has a Z-value of -3.371 (P-value = 0.001) as opposed to the fixed effect’s Z-value of -26.024 (P-value = 0.000). The degree of heterogenicity revealed Q-value (926.104), I-squared (97.948), P-value (0.000), and the Tau-squared of 0.989 with a 0.519 Standard Error are the final heterogeneity variables. Egger’s linear regression test for asymmetry did not indicate publication bias, intercept (-0.53), 95% confidence interval (-6.45-5.39), t-value (0.18), df = 18. The 1-tailed P-value is 0.426, and the 2-tailed P-value is 0.852. The outcome of Kendall’s tau with continuity correction (-0.00526), with a 1-tailed P-value of 0.487 and 2 -tailed P-value of 0,974. Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill method (only one study trimmed at the left side) resulted in an adjusted correlation from − 0.857 to − 0.737 with 95% CI: − 1.345 to − 0.428. The results of the present study indicate the association of Streptococcus species with clinical upper respiratory signs in horses. ©2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

ABSTRACT: The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid has diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value in neurological illnesses in horses. There are different methods for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid, with the collection between the C1 and C2 vertebrae being a more recent methodology, which allows the procedure to be performed in standing patients, without the limitations of general anesthesia and with a low contamination of the sample with blood, presenting itself as a practical alternative. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a local dural blockade in healthy horses submitted to cerebrospinal fluid collection by atlantoaxial puncture and the quality of the samples obtained by this procedure, which were submitted to physical, chemical, and cytological analyses. The animals were evaluated considering aspects such as pain, sensitivity, the presence of edema, temperature variations, and ultrasonographic alterations post-collection. Discrete local changes were observed after the puncture, and the procedure was considered safe and simple to perform. Lidocaine blockade could reduce the reaction elicited by the needle passing through the dura mater, and the samples obtained showed satisfactory quality and laboratory results consistent with the values compiled in the literature. Transient hyperthermia was observed in 70% (7/10) of the animals in the dural blockade group, and 80%(8/10) of the patients from the control group, totalizing 75% of all individuals evaluated. The rectal temperature alteration was observed 4 to 12 hours after the procedure and was entirely resolved without intervention by the 24-hour evaluation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Adult horses with proprioceptive ataxia and behavior changes that have histologic lesions consistent with neurodegenerative disease have been increasingly recognized. Hypothesis/Objectives: Describe the history, clinical findings and histopathologic features of horses presented to a referral institution with neuroaxonal degeneration. Animals: One hundred horses with a necropsy diagnosis of neuroaxonal degeneration compatible with neuroaxonal dystrophy/degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM). Methods: Retrospective study of horses presented to the University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton Center, between 2017 and 2021 with a necropsy diagnosis of eNAD/EDM. Results: Affected horses had a median age of 8 years (range, 1-22), and the majority were Warmbloods (72). Sixty-eight horses had behavioral changes, and all 100 had proprioceptive ataxia (median grade, 2/5). Fifty-seven horses had abnormal findings on cervical vertebral radiographs, and 14 had myelographic findings consistent with compressive myelopathy. No antemortem diagnostic test results were consistently associated with necropsy diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. All 100 horses had degenerative lesions characteristic of eNAD in the brainstem gray matter, and 24 had concurrent degenerative features of EDM in the spinal cord white matter. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Clinical and histopathologic findings in this large group of horses with neurodegenerative disease were most consistent with eNAD/EDM, but with a different signalment and clinical presentation from earlier descriptions. The increasing occurrence of neurodegenerative disease in horses and the safety risk posed emphasize the importance of focused research in affected horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Strangles is considered an important equine contagious bacterial caused by Streptococcus equi. This study planned to evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-S. equi antibodies in horses located in Mosul city, Iraq for the first time. The sera were collected from 184 animals (156 horses and 28 donkeys), and then they were screened by using indirect ELISA (iELISA) to effectively check the seroconverted animals. The results of this study showed that the total prevalence rate of strangles in horses was 12%, (0.0% in donkeys) and the seroprevalence rate in animals less than 3 years old was 20%, while in animals of ages 3 years and more, it was 7% (P< 0.05). The seroprevalence rate in racing and horses with respiratory signs was significantly higher than ones with Draught and apparently normal conditions (P< 0.05). Any significant relationship was not found between seropositive animals and sex, and among racing horses (P< 0.05). To close, the presence of anti-S. equi antibodies in the examined horses might require more attention to reduce the incidence of the disease in horse breeding centers found in the study zone. © 2011-2024 Journal of Advanced Veterinary Research.

ABSTRACT: In this report, thermography was evaluated as a portable diagnostic tool in addition to ultrasonography, which is frequently used in the diagnosis of medial patellar ligament tears in horses. Thermography revealed that the medial patellar ligament has difficulty absorbing quadriceps forces and that the cranial surface of the stifle joint shows elevated temperatures at rest. At the end of training, load sharing occurred between the cranial and caudal surfaces of the joint and the quadriceps muscle. Temperature changes captured by thermography may indicate the severity of the injury and help clinicians suspect ligament tears even without access to ultrasonography. © 2024, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To investigate the effect of isoflurane anesthesia on thermoregulation and peripheral heat loss in dorsally recumbent horses. Study design: Prospective, clinical study. Animals: Seven adult horses (2.6 ± 1.5 years old, 455 ± 70.2 kg). Methods: Horses underwent elective surgical procedures in dorsal recumbency under general anesthesia (GA) maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Rectal (TR), intranasal (TN) and fetlock surface temperatures (TF) were measured every 10 minutes for the first 80 minutes following induction of GA. Room temperature (TRO) was monitored during the study. Statistical analysis to determine differences between temperature measurement sites and techniques (TR, TN and TF), and differences over time were completed using a mixed-effects model with Tukey's multiple comparison or Dunnett's multiple comparison testing where appropriate. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Following induction of anesthesia, TF was significantly increased compared with baseline (0 minutes) from 40 to 80 minutes (p < 0.01). No significant differences were detected in TR and TN at any time point compared with baseline (p > 0.05). TF was significantly lower than TN (p < 0.02) at all time points and TR from times 0 to 70 minutes (p < 0.04). There were no significant differences between TR and TN at any time (p > 0.05). Conclusions: In horses undergoing isoflurane GA, TF increased, indicating peripheral heat loss likely because of vasodilation, whereas TR showed a clinically relevant decrease over time. These findings are suggestive of body heat redistribution during GA in horses in dorsal recumbency. Thermographic imaging of the peripheral limbs in combination with TR and TN monitoring allowed for recognition of peripheral heat redistribution in anesthetized horses. Clinical relevance: Anesthetized horses experience peripheral heat loss through their extremities as a result of vasodilation. Mitigating peripheral heat loss may improve thermoregulation and reduce hypothermic complications in anesthetized horses. © 2023 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: West Nile virus (WNV) is a globally significant mosquito-borne Flavivirus that causes West Nile disease (WND). In Libya, evidence of WNV circulation has been reported in humans but never in animals. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of WNV infection in horses and dogs in Libya. In total, 574 and 63 serum samples were collected from apparently healthy, unvaccinated horses and dogs, respectively, between 2016 and 2019. A commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) kit was initially used to test the collected samples for the presence of WNV Ig-G antibodies. Positive and doubtful sera were also tested using a more specific virus neutralisation assay to confirm whether the ELISA-positive results were due to WNV or other Flavivirus antibodies. The seroprevalence of WNV IgG antibodies according to ELISA was 13.2% out of 574 of total horses’ samples and 30.2% out of 63 of total dogs’ samples. The virus neutralisation test (VNT) confirmed that 10.8% (62/574) and 27% (17/63) were positive for WNV-neutralising titres ranging from 1:10 to 1:640. Univariable analysis using chi-square tests was conducted to measure the statistical significance of the association between the hypothesized risk factors including city, sex, breed, and age group and were then analyzed using the subsequent multivariable logistic regression model for horse samples. Age group was found to be the only significant risk factor in this study. The results of the present study provide new evidence about WNV circulation in Libya. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Echocardiographic measurements are important prognostic indicators but might be influenced by heart rate and blood pressure. This is particularly important when comparing repeated examinations. Hypothesis: To determine the effect of physiological stress at mildly increased heart rates and pharmacological challenge using IV administration of N-butylscopolammonium bromide and metamizol sodium on heart rate, blood pressure, and echocardiographic measurements. Animals: Twenty healthy Warmblood horses. Methods: Randomized crossover study. Horses were examined echocardiographically by 2-dimensional, M-mode, pulsed wave (PW) Doppler, and PW tissue Doppler imaging with simultaneous ECG recording and noninvasive blood pressure measurements during rest, physiological stress, and pharmacological challenge. Cardiac dimensions and functions were measured by a blinded observer. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Mean heart rate and arterial blood pressure were significantly higher during physiological stress (46 ± 2 bpm, 93 ± 16 mm Hg) and pharmacological challenge (62 ± 13 bpm, 107 ± 17 mm Hg) compared with rest (34 ± 3 bpm, 86 ± 12 mm Hg; P <.05). Compared with rest, physiological stress resulted in increased left atrial fractional area change (34.3 ± 7.5 vs 27.3 ± 5.1%; P =.01) and left ventricular late diastolic radial wall motion velocity (13 ± 3 vs 10 ± 2 cm/s; P =.01) but had no significant effect on most other echocardiographic variables. Compared with rest, pharmacological challenge led to significantly decreased left atrial and diastolic ventricular dimensions (left ventricular internal diameter: 10.3 ± 0.9 vs 10.7 ± 0.8 cm; P =.01), increased aortic and pulmonary diameters, and ventricular wall thickness. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Physiological stress at mildly increased heart rates significantly enhanced atrial pump function. Larger heart rate and blood pressure increases during pharmacological challenge resulted in altered cardiac dimensions. This should be taken into account when evaluating echocardiographic measurements at increased heart rates. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Satellite cells are an important cellular model for studying muscle growth and development and mammalian locomotion-related molecular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the effects of voltage, pulse duration, and DNA dosage on horse skeletal muscle satellite cells’ electroporation transfection efficiency using the eukaryotic expression plasmid Td Tomato-C1 (5.5 kb) encoding the red fluorescent protein gene mainly based on fluorescence-positive cell rate and cell survival rate. By comparison of different voltages, pulse durations, and DNA doses, horse skeletal muscle satellite cells have nearly 80% transfection efficiency under the condition of voltage 120 V, DNA dosage 7 µg/ml, and pulse duration 30 ms. This optimized electroporation condition would facilitate the application of horse skeletal muscle satellite cells in genetic studies of muscle function and related diseases. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of fenbendazole and ivermectin on strongyles and Parascaris sp. infecting adult riding horses in three regions with different climates. During 2021 and 2022 fecal specimens were randomly collected from 483 horses older than three years in 31 equestrian clubs in Hamedan (n = 217), Yazd (n = 146) and Tabriz cities (n = 120). Eggs were counted by McMaster technique, and the strongyle larvae were identified using coproculture, PCR and sequencing. Horses with strongyles and Parascaris egg counts ≥150 were enrolled in fecal egg count reduction (FECR) examination following treatment with ivermectin or fenbendazole. In total, 26.5% of examined horses were positive with at least one parasite. Infection rates varied in three cities i.e., 25.8% in Hamedan, 28.8% in Yazd, 25% in Tabriz. Fifty-seven horses had FECR measured. FECR below <90% was observed for IVM-strongyle in two horses in Tabriz, for FBZ-strongyle in two horses in Tabriz and two horses in Hamedan, for IVM-Parascaris in one horse in all three cities, and for FBZ-Parascaris in one horse in Yazd. Furthermore, FECR 90–100% was observed in IVM-Parascaris and FBZ -Parascaris groups in Tabriz. Data herein presented demonstrate different degrees of resistance of strongyles and Parascaris infecting horses in Iran against both ivermectin and fenbendazole. Since non-principled use of anthelminthics is common among horse owners, urgency of test-and-treatment strategy should be educated and implemented by policy-making organizations. Evaluating efficacy of different anthelminthics and choosing the most effective treatment in each region is suggested. © 2023

ABSTRACT: An overabundance of wild horses and burros on federal lands can lead to suboptimal welfare when there are insufficient forage and water resources. Placing some of these animals in private homes has been identified as a key part of the solution. A nationwide online survey completed by 2,247 current and former horse owners is used to assess the feasibility of accommodating this strategy. The survey tool addressed basic horse ownership and demographic information, previous experience with wild horses, and hypothetical wild horse adoption scenarios. Results suggest that most respondents are receptive to the idea of adopting a wild horse, with previous adopters and younger potential adopters showing greater willingness-to-pay. By reducing existing barriers to adoption, which includes educating the horse-owning public on adoption requirements, expanding the training of wild horses, and targeting certain age groups of potential adopters, our study suggests that it may be possible to increase the annual number of adoptions over current levels. With appropriate and informed strategies, enhanced welfare of privately adopted and on-range animals can be achieved. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: To better understand physiological and pathological movement patterns in the equine thoracolumbar spine, investigation of the biomechanics on a segmental level requires a constant moment. A constant moment along the spinal column means that the same torque acts on each vertebral segment, allowing the range of motion of different segments to be compared. The aims of this study were to investigate the range of motion of the equine thoracolumbar spine in horses with and without spinal pathology and to examine whether the pressure between the spinous processes depends on the direction of the applied moment. Thoracolumbar spine specimens (T8-L4) of 23 horses were mounted in a custom-made mechanical test rig to investigate spinal biomechanics during lateral bending, axial rotation, flexion and extension using computed tomographic imaging. Results were compared between horses with spondylosis, overriding spinous processes and specimens free of gross pathology. The interspinous space pressure was additionally determined using a foil sensor. The median lateral bending between T9 and L3 was 3.7°–4.1° (IQR 5.4°–8.0°). Maximum rotational movement with inconsistent coupled motion was observed at T9–T16 (p < 0.05). The dorsoventral range of motion was greatest in segments T9–T11 (p < 0.05). Spondylosis and overriding spinous processes restricted spinal mobility, depending on the severity of the condition. There was no significant difference in interspinous pressure during motion (p = 0.54). The biomechanical study confirmed that the range of motion of intervertebral joints depends on the anatomical position of the joint and the direction of the moment applied. Restricted mobility was evident in the presence of different grades of overriding spinous processes or spondylosis. A better understanding of equine spinal biomechanics in horses with spinal pathology facilitates individual rehabilitation. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Testicular degeneration (TD) is the most frequent cause of sub or infertility in stallions. Currently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been studied as a therapeutic option for several diseases including induced-TD in laboratory animals. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of intratesticular MSC therapy on the testicular histology of stallions submitted to scrotal heat stress. Ten healthy Miniature-horse stallions were submitted to testicular heat stress induced by a heating wrap device (42-45°C). Afterward, the stallions were divided into two groups and treated seven days later. MSCs-treated stallions were treated with an intratesticular injection of 10 × 106 of MSCs diluted in 5 mL of PBS, whereas placebo-treated stallions had 5 mL of PBS intratesticular injected. All stallions had testicular biopsies collected seven days before and one- and 14-days post-heat stress and were castrated 30 days after testicular insult. Tissue sections were stained with H&E and evaluated for the tubular and luminal diameter, epithelial thickness, seminiferous tubules (STs) integrity, the number of spermatozoa in the STs, and the percent of abnormal STs. Significance was set at P≤0.05. In both groups, testicular heat stress damaged the STs (P<0.05). However, STs’ parameters were improved in MSCs-treated stallions compared to placebo-treated stallions 30 days after the testicular insult (P<0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that intratesticular MSC therapy provided a therapeutic advantage in rescuing acute TD in stallions. However, further studies are essential to evaluate the benefits of this therapy on semen parameters and stallions with idiopathic TD. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Methods to determine exercise intensity thresholds, such as the aerobic and anaerobic threshold, that separate different exercise intensities in exercising horses in the field setting or on the treadmill often require equipment, standardised conditions and/or blood sampling. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a heart rate variability variable proposed as a non-invasive tool for exercise intensity monitoring and with a potential association with exercise intensity thresholds and fatigue. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the first component of DFA (DFA-α1) during standardised field incremental exercise tests in sport horses in active Eventing competition and in sport horses ridden without the goal of participating in competitions, and (2) to determine if DFA-α1 is associated with blood lactate concentration. Null hypotheses of the study were that (1) DFA-α1 is not correlated with blood lactate concentration measurements and (2) the correlation between DFA-α1 and blood lactate concentration is not stronger than the one between blood lactate concentration and heart rate or blood lactate concentration and speed. An in vivo observational study was performed analysing exercising electrocardiograms obtained in 59 standardised exercise tests in the field. DFA-α1 was significantly and moderately correlated with blood lactate concentration (ρ = −0.49, P < 0.001). A strong correlation was observed between blood lactate concentration and speed (ρ = −0.80, P < 0.001), as well as between blood lactate concentration and heart rate (ρ = 0.74, P < 0.001). DFA-α1 correlation with blood lactate concentration was moderate but weaker than the correlation of blood lactate concentration and heart rate or blood lactate concentration and speed. DFA-α1 was not a useful surrogate of blood lactate concentration in field incremental standardised tests used for sport horses in this setting. © K. Murphy et al., 2024.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To describe the repair utilizing integral-anchor barbed suture in equine rectal tears. ANIMALS 3 horses aged 3 to 10 years old with grade 3 to 4 rectal tears. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Grade 3 and 4 rectal tears were referred for surgical repair immediately after iatrogenic tearing or tearing during parturition. Integral-anchor barbed suture (Stratafix Symmetric PDS Plus, size 1, 18" CT-1) was placed using long-handled instruments or hand closure depending on the accessibility and visibility of the tear. Closure of grade 3 tears was performed using a continuous appositional pattern. A horizontal mattress pattern was performed in the grade 4 tear. No other surgical procedures were performed. RESULTS Two grade 3 tears were successfully repaired with no complications and discharged from the hospital. One grade 4 tear was successfully repaired; however, 4 days post-surgery partial dehiscence of the suture site occurred, and the horse was euthanized. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Grade 3 rectal tears were repaired successfully by using an integral-anchor barbed suture. No post-operative complications were reported. Blind hand suturing could be performed in cranial locations when the laceration could not be made visible. For grade 4 rectal tears, additional surgical procedures beyond barbed suture closure are needed. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Relationships between people and horses are often described in terms reflecting attachment, understanding, and mutual bonding. How this bond is characterized from a human perspective can provide insight into the human–horse relationship and its impact on animal welfare. This mixed methods study sought to understand what people experience with their horse and how they experience it to discover reasons why people believe there is a human–horse bond. An online survey asked respondents about horse ownership, days per week of one-on-one contact, length of time interacting with the horse, and their primary reason (Western riding, companionship, etc) for spending time with the horse. Demographic data on gender, age, ethnicity, household income, and country of residence of the respondent was also collected. An open-ended question asked respondents to describe an instance where they thought a bond between a horse and a human had been demonstrated. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis to examine human–horse interaction from a phenomenological perspective. Aspects that characterized a bond included the horse approaching and making physical contact with their person, vocalizing upon seeing their human, protecting their person from physical harm, and trying hard for their person. How the bond was experienced included a shared experience, often in dire situations, the horse trusting and relaxing in the presence of their person, the horse missing their person or remembering them after a long time apart, and anthropomorphic aspects of two-way communication and affection. Respondent age, income level, and whether they partook in riding were associated with some of the aspects describing the bond with the horse. The four pillars of attachment theory were evidenced in the survey responses, and anthropomorphism featured largely. These results form a foundation for understanding the human view of the human–horse bond which can improve horse welfare through directed research and communication of horse ethology and cognition. © 2024 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe the clinical application and outcome of MicroPulse™ transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) treatment in horses with glaucoma. Animals Studied: Four client-owned horses with primary (n = 2) or secondary (n = 2) glaucoma. Methods: Horses were treated with MP-TSCPC under standing sedation with a minimum of 30 days of follow-up (range 30–1241 days). Affected eyes were treated with a 31.3% duty cycle and 3000 mW laser power for a total of 180 s. Data collected included signalment, pre- and post-procedure intraocular pressures (IOPs), laser settings, medications, complications, and repeat therapy. Results: Four horses (5 eyes) received at least one treatment with MP-TSCPC. Mean preoperative IOP was 44 mmHg (range 33–49 mmHg). The immediate mean postoperative IOP was 34 mmHg (4 eyes; range 19–55 mmHg). At 1 week, IOP was 38 mmHg (5 eyes; range 21–80 mmHg), at 2 weeks was 40 mmHg (3 eyes, range 17–80 mmHg), at 1 month was 35 mmHg (5 eyes; range 20–50 mmHg), at 3 months was 18 mmHg (2 eyes; range 14–21 mmHg), at 6 months was 35 mmHg (2 eyes; range 30–39 mmHg), and at >300 days was 24 mmHg (3 eyes; range 18–29 mmHg). Complications included corneal ulceration (n = 1 eye), uncontrolled IOP (n = 3 eyes), and need for repeat treatment (n = 2 eyes). Conclusions: MP-TSCPC used with the above-described settings was unsuccessful in treating the majority of cases. Future studies should be targeted at primary glaucoma cases and with use of alternative laser settings. © 2024 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: The Turkmen horse is one of the oldest breeds in the world with unique characteristics in agility, endurance and jump, being publicly acclaimed. Laminitis affects the limbs and decreases athletic performance. Radiographic evaluation is essential to confirm the sinking diagnosis in every breed of a horse suffering from laminitis. Since no information about distal phalanx radiographic measurements in this breed has been reported, the current study was designed and conducted. In the present study, 24 clinically sound registered Turkmen horses of both sexes (15 mares and nine stallions) were selected. Lateromedial radiographic views of both front distal phalanges were taken, focusing on the distal phalanx. After magnification correction, images were used to measure founder distances (FD) and other distal phalanx radiographic measurements using an image processing program. There was no significant difference between radiographic measurements of the left and right front feet. The FD had a significant positive correlation with weight. The horses under 3 years of age had a significantly greater U angle than the horses over the age of three. Also, palmarocortical length (PCL) in the Turkmen stallions was significantly higher than mares. In this investigation, PCL in horses under the age of three was significantly lower than horses over 3 years of age. The values determined in this study can be used as baseline data of front feet in Turkmen horses. © 2024 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study reports the spatial and temporal distribution of ascarid and strongylid nematodes in Thoroughbred horses by age category across different climatic zones in Australia over an 18-month period. Faecal samples (n = 2046) from individual horses were analysed using the modified McMaster technique for faecal egg counts (FECs). Strongylids were identified using PCR-directed next-generation sequencing of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Yearlings had the highest prevalence (82%) of strongyle eggs followed by weanlings (79%), foals (58%), wet mares (49%) and dry mares (46%). For Parascaris spp., foals had the highest prevalence (35%) followed by weanlings (21%) and yearlings (10%). The highest mean FECs for Parascaris spp. were observed in foals (525 eggs per gram [EPG] of faeces) while those for strongyles were in yearlings (962 EPG). Among horses that were classified as adults at the time of sampling, 77% (860 of 1119) of mares were low (i.e., <250 EPG) strongyle egg-shedders. Mean strongyle FEC counts were highest in the Mediterranean (818 EPG) followed by summer (599 EPG), winter (442 EPG), and non-seasonal (413 EPG) rainfall zones. Twenty-six nematode species were detected, with Cylicostephanus longibursatus (26.5%), Cylicocyclus nassatus (23.7%) and Coronocyclus coronatus (20.5%) being the most frequently detected species. Their richness and relative abundance varied with horse age, season and climatic zone. In addition, Strongylus equinus and Triodontophorus spp. (T. brevicauda and T. serratus) were also detected. This comprehensive study elucidates spatial (climatic zone) and temporal (i.e., seasonal) trends in prevalence and burdens of intestinal nematodes in Australian horses using non-invasive conventional and molecular methods. The information presented in this study is crucial for developing integrated management strategies to control horse parasites in farmed horses. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A 20-year-old, sexually intact male Dutch Warmblood horse was presented with a 5-day history of difficulty moving and non-flexion of the right pelvic limb, followed by subcutaneous swelling and permanent lateral decubitus. Despite attempts at palliative care, the horse was euthanized after clinical worsening and lack of treatment response. The main gross finding was a soft, red-to-black, lobulated mass involving the right semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris muscles. Soft, red nodules were also seen in all pulmonary lobes and adrenal glands. Histology revealed neoplastic proliferation of malignant polygonal cells, occasionally arranged in irregular anastomosing vascular channels filled with erythrocytes. Neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for factor VIII–related antigen, confirming the blood vascular origin. A final diagnosis of epithelioid hemangiosarcoma was made. These findings reinforced the inclusion of hemangiosarcoma as a differential diagnosis of equine muscular lesions and highlighted the histological features of the epithelioid hemangiosarcoma subtype. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

ABSTRACT: The objective was to identify sets of relevant atributes for pricing Mangalarga Marchador horses at auctions and to estimate a hedonic pricing function. We analyzed 452 horses at 20 auctions. The studied variables were characteristics intrinsic to the animals and attributes that influence sale price, which were identified through generalized linear and logistic model analysis. For each additional prize and additional bid, the prices decreased by R$ 2110.00 and R$ 549.00 respectively. The individual’s maternal grandsire positively or negatively affected prices, from R$-86.70 to R$ + 35.50. Non-pregnant females were penalized in price by R$ 110.00 compared to non-castrated males. A bay coat added R$ 215.00 to prices when compared to chestnut animals. Online auctions added R$ 20.10 to prices and virtual auctions penalized prices by R$ 617.00. The gray coat devalues a sale by 48% and Seller 3 decreasing by 18%. We conclude that auction type, number of prizes, share sold, animal category, coat, seller, number of bids, and maternal grandsire influenced the prices of Mangalarga Marchador horses, and that coat and seller that influenced the probability of the animal being sold. © 2024, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

ABSTRACT: Horses are intermediate hosts of Sarcocystis spp. capable of forming cysts in their musculature. This study aimed to detect sarcocysts and investigate the presence of nucleic acids from Sarcocystis spp. in samples of striated muscles from horses in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, necropsied at the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory of the Federal University of Santa Maria. A total of 108 samples were collected from 24 horses and examined through direct examination. Microscopic tissue cysts were observed in three samples: tongue (2) and esophagus (1) from two animals. Extractions were performed on the found cysts and tissues, even though sarcocystosis detection was not present. DNA samples were subjected to Nested-PCR using Tg18s primers, and the amplified products were subjected to Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) using DdeI and HpaII enzymes. DNA belonging to Sarcocystis spp. was amplified in tissues from 91.7% (22/24) of the equines, and 67.6% (73/108) of the samples tested positive in the Nested-PCR reaction. The tissues with the highest detection frequency were: diaphragm 92.3% (12/13), gluteal muscle 77.2% (17/22), and esophagus 66.7% (4/6). In RFLP, Sarcocystis spp. was detected in 21 tissues from 11/22 equines, and cysts, identified through nucleotide sequencing, were determined to be S. bertrami. S. neurona was identified in 11 samples from 7/22 animals, with co-infection detected in 5/22 cases. The high detection rate indicates a concerning circulation of the protozoan, particularly the zoonotic S. bertrami found in all tissues, which are commonly exported for human consumption. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Delimiting biogeographic regions based on occurrence data is an interesting approach to investigating processes behind biodiversity distribution patterns. Comparing spatial scales and identifying predictor variables of biogeographic regions have wide application for biodiversity conservation. In this study we used a comprehensive database containing more than thirty years of horse fly records to estimate species richness, endemism, and species composition, and regionalize the Amazon biogeographically. We compared five spatial scales defined by grid size (1–5º), and test five hypotheses (elevation, climate, vegetation cover, and two regionalizations from the literature) to identify predictors of the biogeographic regions. Endemism, species richness and composition were predicted by different sets of predictor variables, although the models were highly dependent on spatial scale. We identified three well-defined biogeographic regions, which have been formed by a combination of geographic distance, climate and historical factors converging with some theories proposed for mammals. Our models indicated dispersal as a key factor for regionalization, as it can be constrained by a combination of climate and historical processes changing habitats over time, although this finding was highly dependent on spatial scale. We showed that horse flies are interesting models for biogeography although they have been historically neglected. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Cribbing, a stereotypic oral behavior observed in horses, involves placing incisors on a fixed object, arching the neck, pulling against the object, and emitting an audible grunt. This behavior has been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and gastric ulceration. In this randomized crossover study, we investigated the impact of a GI support supplement (SPL) on the GI environment and physiology of four cribbing (CB) and four non-cribbing horses (NCB). Mature Quarter Horses, acclimated to individual stalls for 16 hours daily with paddock turnout in pairs for 8 hours per day, were randomly assigned to receive either the SPL or placebo for 21 days, followed by a 2-week washout period. Fecal and gastric samples were collected for pH determination and blood samples were analyzed for serum cortisol and gastrin levels. Endoscopic examinations assessed gastric ulcer severity, and cribbing frequency and bouts were recorded via video surveillance. Data were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA. Results showed no differences in fecal and gastric pH between cribbing statuses. However, an interaction between supplementation and cribbing status was observed for squamous mucosa ulcer scores (P=0.003). There were no differences in glandular mucosa ulcer scores, serum cortisol, serum gastrin, and crib-bite count between CB and NCB horses or between supplementation groups. Crib-bout duration did not differ with supplementation, but differences were found between periods (P<0.05) and hour ranges (P<0.001). Our findings suggest that the GI support supplement may not effectively address cribbing behavior or alter the GI environment in NCB or CB horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: This study assessed luteolysis and side effects in jennies receiving standard horse-recommended doses of cloprostenol and dinoprost. Sixteen cycles of eight jennies were randomly assigned in a sequential crossover design to receive dinoprost (5 mg, i.m.) and cloprostenol (0.25 mg, i.m.) at 5-d post-ovulation. B-mode and Doppler ultrasonography were employed to assess luteal tissue size and blood flow before (-15 min and 0h) and after (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, and 48h) administering PGF2α. Immunoreactive progesterone concentrations were assayed at similar timepoints via RIA. Side effects such as sweating, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea were scored at 15-min-intervals for 1h after PGF2α. Data normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk's test. Luteal tissue size and blood flow were analyzed using PROC-MIXED and post-hoc by Tukey. Non-parametric tests analyzed side effect variables. The luteal blood flow increased overtime by 27% at 45 min and peaked by 49% at 3 h for dinoprost, and conversely, it increased by 14% at 30 min and peaked at 39% at 5h for cloprostenol (P<0.05). Luteal blood flow was reduced by 50%, 25%, and 10% on both groups at 8, 12, and 24h (P<0.05). Immunoreactive progesterone concentrations decreased in 0.5h for dinoprost and 1h for cloprostenol and gradually decreased by 48h (P<0.05). Dinoprost induced greater sudoresis scores, while cloprostenol resulted in greater abdominal discomfort and diarrhea scores (P<0.05). In conclusion, dinoprost and cloprostenol effectively induced luteolysis with distinct side effects; this could guide practitioners’ case selection to use one or another PGF2α. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many traditional horse keeping and training practices can result in poor horse welfare. To assist reform and identify novel opportunities to facilitate improvements in horse welfare, this study sought to gauge the motivations underlying equestrians’ horse-keeping and training practices. Nineteen amateur equestrians were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Systems thinking and self-determination theory, which proposes humans are intrinsically motivated by three psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and relatedness), provided the theoretical framework for the study. Using reflexive thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (1) achieving equestrian goals is the primary motivator; (2) equestrians work hard to develop their equestrian knowledge and skills; (3) equestrians are highly motivated to compete and/or participate in club activities; and (4) achieving a financial return on investment is important to many equestrians. Findings suggest that equestrians do not prioritize the three psychological needs proposed by self-determination theory equally. Competence (goal achievement) was the highest priority for equestrians, followed by the need for autonomy (control), and then relatedness (horse–human partnership). The spectrum of equestrians’ motivational priorities suggests that there is an imbalance between horse needs and human needs when selecting horse-keeping and training practices. These insights can be leveraged to develop initiatives that engage all stakeholders, so that meeting human needs and horse needs is more equitably balanced. We also found that equestrians’ practices were highly influenced by their desire to participate in competitive equestrian sport, emphasizing the important role equestrian organizations can play in improving horse welfare through the rules of their sports. These findings contribute to the multifaceted reform needed to solve the complex challenge of improving horse welfare, the outcome of which will determine the long-term future of equestrian sport. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Mitral and aortic valve insufficiencies have been commonly reported in horses. The objective of this study was to establish the use of acoustic cardiography (Audicor®) in horses with aortic (AI) or mitral valve insufficiency (MI). A total of 17 healthy horses, 18 horses with AI, and 28 horses with MI were prospectively included. None of the horses was in heart failure. Echocardiography and Audicor® analyses were conducted. Electromechanical activating time (EMAT), rate-corrected EMATc, left ventricular systolic time (LVST), rate-corrected LVSTc, and intensity and persistence of the third and fourth heart sound (S3, S4) were reported by Audicor®. Graphical analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) phonocardiogram served to visually detect murmurs. Audicor® snapshot variables were compared between groups using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test. The association between Audicor® snapshot variables and the corresponding echocardiographic variables was investigated by linear regression and Bland–Altman analyses. Heart murmurs were not displayed on Audicor® phonocardiograms. No significant differences were found between Audicor® variables obtained in clinically healthy horses and horses with valvular insufficiency. The Audicor® device is unable to detect heart murmurs in horses. Audicor® variables representing cardiac function are not markedly altered, and their association with corresponding echocardiographic variables is poor in horses with valvular insufficiency that are not in heart failure. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horse pythiosis is considered an endemic disease in the Brazilian Pantanal region, causing devastating health and economic losses. This study aimed to enhance the understanding of pythiosis epidemiology, map the distribution of horse body lesions, and investigate the correlation between these lesions and warm body surface areas, potentially implicating hematophagous vectors in the disease's transmission. A prospective study was conducted on equids in the Pantanal Mato-grossense and adjacent areas from 2012 to 2022, with 112 horses and three mules diagnosed with pythiosis. Clinical and epidemiological data, lesions' photographic records, and healthy equids' thermal imaging were collected. Most pythiosis cases occurred between January and March, correlating with regional flood cycles. Most lesions were found on limbs and the ventral abdomen, with dark-colored horses exhibiting a higher frequency of lesions. Interestingly, the thermal mapping revealed that warm areas on a healthy horse's body overlapped significantly with lesion distribution – blood-sucking insects also prefer these areas. The results suggest that pythiosis lesions in horses correlate with warmer areas of the animal body, reinforcing the hypothesis of vector involvement in disease transmission. This study underscores the need for further observational research to fully understand the complex epidemiological dynamics of pythiosis in horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate the agreement between noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP) measured from the tongue and thoracic limb with invasive blood pressure (IBP), and to compare NIBP measured from the tongue and thoracic limb in anaesthetized horses. Study design: Prospective clinical study. Animals: A group of eight client-owned healthy horses anaesthetized for scheduled procedures, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification I–II, weighing (mean ± standard deviation) 498 ± 91 kg and aged 7.8 ± 6.75 years. Methods: Animals were premedicated with intravenous (IV) romifidine (0.04–0.08 mg kg–1) and methadone (0.1 mg kg–1). General anaesthesia was induced IV with ketamine (2.5 mg kg–1) and midazolam (0.05 mg kg–1) and maintained with isoflurane. The facial artery was catheterized for IBP measurements. Systolic (SAP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressures were recorded from the NIBPtongue, NIBPlimb and IBP every 20 minutes during the procedure. Agreement between NIBP and IBP was evaluated based on the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine criteria and American Association for Medical Instrumentation criteria using the Bland–Altman method. Results: The mean bias and precision between IBP and NIBP measured from the tongue met the standards for all pressure ranges (< 10 mmHg and < 15 mmHg, respectively). NIBP measurements from the tongue and thoracic limb tended to underestimate IBP measurements. During hypotension, MAPtongue and DAPtongue overestimated IBP, but both precision and accuracy met the criteria. The overall accuracy and precision of NIBPlimb was poorer than NIBPtongue. The percentage of NIBPtongue that differed from IBP by < 10 mmHg was higher than that recorded with NIBPlimb for SAP (46% versus 25%), MAP (77% versus 28%) and DAP (79% versus 19%). Conclusions and clinical relevance: The tongue is a clinically suitable alternative for assessing arterial blood pressure compared with the thoracic limb and can reliably detect hypotension in healthy anaesthetized horses. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: Severe asthma (SA) in horses, resembling human asthma, is a prevalent, debilitating allergic respiratory condition marked by elevated allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) against environmental proteins; however, research exploring the exposome's influence on IgE profiles is currently limited but holds paramount significance for diagnostic and therapeutic developments. Animals: Thirty-five sports horses were analyzed, consisting of environmentally matched samples from France (5 SA; 6 control), the United States (6 SA; 6 control), and Canada (6 SEA; 6 control). Methods: This intentional cross-sectional study investigated the sensitization profiles of SA-affected and healthy horses via serological antigen microarray profiling. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to identify and rank the importance of allergens for class separation (ie, affected/non-affected) as variable influence of projection (VIP), and allergen with commonality internationally established via frequency analysis. Results: PLS-DA models showed high discriminatory power in predicting SA in horses from Canada (area under the curve [AUC] 0.995) and France (AUC 0.867) but poor discriminatory power in horses from the United States (AUC 0.38). Hev b 5.0101, Cyn D, Der p 2, and Rum cr were the only shared allergens across all geographical groups. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Microarray profiling can identify specific allergenic components associated with SA in horses, while mathematical modeling of this data can be used for disease classification, highlighting the variability of sensitization profiles between geographical locations and emphasizing the importance of local exposure to the prevalence of different allergens. Frequency scoring analysis can identify important variables that contribute to the classification of SA across different geographical regions. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Pain recognition in hospitalized horses is challenging, and the utility of pain scoring systems in horses with ocular disease has not been well-described. Hypothesis/Objectives: Evaluate the horse grimace scale (HGS) and behavior pain score (BPS) in hospitalized horses with ocular disease. We hypothesized that HGS and BPS would be associated with different clinical progressions. Animals: Privately owned horses hospitalized for ocular disease between September 2018 and September 2020. Methods: Retrospective observational study. The HGS and BPS were recorded daily throughout hospitalization. Clinical progressions were categorized as: (a) discharge from hospital after medical treatment, (b) ophthalmic surgery (eg, keratectomy, conjunctival flap, amniotic membrane transplantation, corneal transplant), or (c) enucleation. Temporal trends in HGS and BPS were assessed using linear regression. Correlations among slope, intercept, and progression were determined using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Of 65 horses that met inclusion criteria, 29 (45%) were discharged after exclusively medical management, 28 (43%) underwent ophthalmic surgery, and 8 (12%) underwent enucleation. Two horses (3%) had 2 ophthalmic surgeries performed. The BPS scores at admission were higher in horses that were managed medically than in those that underwent enucleation (P =.01). Horses requiring enucleation had higher increases in HGS (P =.02) and BPS (P =.01) during hospitalization than horses that were medically managed and a higher increase in BPS (P =.04) than horses that required ophthalmic surgery. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Pain scoring may represent a useful tool for monitoring progression and response to treatment in hospitalized horses with ocular disease. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe a 3-wire method with endoscopic guidance for extensive nasal septum resection. Study design: Retrospective study. Sample population: Thirteen horses with nasal septum diseases. Methods: In anesthetized horses in left lateral recumbency, endoscopic guidance was used to place obstetrical wires for the ventral and caudal incisions in the nasal septum and a trephine opening was used to place the dorsal wire. The rostral aspect of the septum was incised with a scalpel, followed by incisions with the preplaced wires, and the nasal passages were packed with gauze. Horses were recovered with a temporary tracheotomy. Results: Conversion to intraoral placement of wires was required in two horses, one to correct entangled wires and the other because hemorrhage obscured the endoscopic view. Exercise tolerance was improved postoperatively, abnormal respiratory noise was decreased or eliminated by surgery in all horses, and all owners were satisfied. One Thoroughbred racehorse performed with modest success. Conclusions: Modification of the 3-wire method was effective and safe for extensive nasal septum removal. Technical complications of the procedure include entangling of wires and intraoperative hemorrhage. Clinical significance: Endoscopic guidance can be used to place obstetrical wires for nasal septum resection in small horses and precludes use of a large tracheotomy for anesthetic delivery. Reasons for athletic failures were difficult to establish retrospectively, although assessment of postoperative noise at speed might be more relevant to recovery of athletic potential than assessment at slower gaits. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the effect of environment, horse and type of different field standardised exercise tests (fSET) on incremental lactate concentration and recovery time in endurance horses. Forty-eight endurance horses underwent one or multiple fSET on a 700-m all-weather racetrack. The fSET comprised phase 1 canter at 19.5-21.5 km/h for 19 km (group N), or 37 km split by 20 minutes of rest (group E1) or 37 km (group E2), followed by phase 2 canter at 26-32.6 km/h and phase 3 at 27.7-42.8 km/h, for 1,400 m each for all groups. Blood lactates were recorded after each phase. Linear mixed models were built with blood lactate value and recovery time as dependent variables and horse and environment data, and type of fSET as fixed effect variables, with horse and horse × fSET group as random effects. Data from a total of 130 fSETs were considered; lactate values were 0.78-7.73 mmol/l (median 1.79 mmol/l) for phase 1, 1.70-10.68 mmol/l (median 3.89 mmol/l) for phase 2, and 3.7-20.86 mmol/l (median 8.74 mmol/l) for phase 3. Blood lactate values after phase 1 and phase 2 were significantly lower in group E1 (median 1.49 mmol/l; median 3.12 mmol/l) compared with group N (median 2.77 mmol/l; median 5.28 mmol/l; P < 0.001) and group E2 (median 2.06 mmol/l; median 4.39 mmol/l; P < 0.001). Blood lactate after phase 3 did not differ between groups. There were two medical and 19 minor musculoskeletal issues within 2 hours after the fSETs. Weather temperature affected blood lactate values after phase 1 and 2 (R = 0.62-0.63). Blood lactate after phase 1 (R = 0.93) and 2 (R = 0.66) affected values after phase 2 and 3, respectively. There was a considerable variation among horses and horse × fSET group random effects. Moreover, blood lactate values are affected by both weather conditions and by horse individual characteristics. © 2024 Brill Wageningen Academic. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Nine different species of Equus caballus papillomavirus (EcPV) and three bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) have been reported to infect horses. However, there are few descriptions of such infections in China. In our pioneer study on Chinese horses, we identified EcPV-2 in the nasal swabs (4/230, 1.7%) of Yili horses, and the semen (3/18, 16.7%) of thoroughbred horses. This indicated that EcPV is indeed hosted by horses in China, and that EcPV-2 might be transmitted though breeding. Further detection of EcPVs in the lung tissues of aborted fetuses of Yili horses, which were originally negative for equid herpes viruses, demonstrated EcPV-2 positivity in 19 of 50 samples, thereby indicating that EcPV-2 may be a new pathogen responsible for causing abortion. Thereafter, sequence analyses of the L1 genes of 26 EcPV-2 in China were performed, indicating that EcPV-2, which primarily infects horses in China, shared 98.3–99.9% nt identity with the published sequences for EcPV-2. These observations indicated that EcPV-2 identified in the current study were highly similar variants of the previously identified strains of EcPV-2. Phylogenetic analysis based on L1 gene sequences from GenBank showed that the EcPV-2 found in Chinese horses was closely related to and clustered together with an already known EcPV-2a lineage. Our study provides the first evidence related to EcPV-2 infection in Chinese horses, which can serve as a causative agent for Yili horse abortions, and may thus lay the foundation for a systematic and detailed epidemiological study of this infection in Chinese horses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the potential benefits of the administration of red ginseng (RG) on lipid metabolism and the profiles of individual free fatty acids (FFAs) in healthy horses. Eight healthy horses, raised under similar conditions, were randomly divided into two groups, each comprising four horses. The experimental group received powdered RG (600 mg/kg/day) mixed with a carrier, and the control group received only the carrier. The parameters associated with lipid metabolism and probable adverse effects were evaluated in both groups after 3 weeks. The computational molecular networking (MN) approach was applied to analyze the FFA profiles. The results indicated that RG administration significantly reduced blood triglyceride levels in the experimental group. Analysis of the FFAs using MN revealed significant decreases in specific types of FFAs (C12:0, dodecanoic acid; C14:0, myristric acid; C18:1, oleic acid; C18:2, linoleic acid). RG consumption did not produce significant adverse effects on the renal, hepatic, and immune functions. Thus, RG was found to effectively modulate lipid metabolism and the levels of individual FFAs. The application of the MN for the analysis of FFAs represents a novel approach and can be considered for future research. Copyright © 2024 Kwak, Yoo and Yoon.

ABSTRACT: The reliability and effectiveness of today's electrical grids rely heavily on optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD). The ORPD problem gets more challenging to resolve in the setting of ever-increasingly dynamic and complex systems. To handle the ORPD while also considering the existence of electric vehicles, this research introduces a novel technique: the Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Sea Horse Optimization (PSOSHO) algorithm. Byreducing both active power loss and voltage variation, the proposed PSOSHO approach aims at improving the efficiency and reliability of the power grid. Simulation studies on reference power grids, including the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus networks, verified its efficacy. Existing metaheuristic optimization techniques are compared using the same restrictions, governing parameters, and data. The results show that the PSOSHO method is trustworthy and effective in resolving the ORPD problem. One of the most pressing issues facing today's electricity grids is how to accommodate the growing number of electric vehicles. Real data on electric vehicles are incorporated in the analyses to obtain a realistic study. The suggested PSOSHO algorithm is a significant step forward in this area, providing a reliable and effective answer to the problem of optimum reactive power dispatch and helping to ensure the long-term viability of power systems in the age of electromobility. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to evaluate the personality components of Arabian and Thoroughbred horses (TB) using the Horse Personality Questionnaire (HPQ) and examine their relationship with breed, sex, and racing performance. Within the scope of the research, race data of 96 horses from Thoroughbred (n = 56) and Arabian horse (n = 40) breeds that participated in flat races were taken from the official websites of Turkish Jockey Club. HPQ was constructed using 26 behaviorally defined adjectives. Thereafter, latent class analysis was carried out to determine distinct classes (subgroups) by using the questionnaire that described the personalities of horses. Three distinct personality classes of both TB and Arabian horses were compared. While there was a significant difference in sex distribution among the personality classes of TB (P = 0.023), this difference was not observed in the classes of Arabian horses (P = 0.580). There was no significant difference in terms of age and some racing characteristics in the per- sonality classes of both Arabian and TB horses (P > 0.05). In conclusion, it was seen that some personality classes of the horses could not be determined in the type of management system where there was no paddock and horses cannot display some of their intra-species social behaviors. For understanding horse personality, it is crucial to observe their intra-species interactions Simultaneously, by evaluating the data on horse personality from a scientific perspective and appraising the sportive performance of horses with a holistic approach, ethical equitation would be possible. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Trypanosoma evansi is a widespread hemoflagellate parasite that causes surra (trypanosomiasis) in a variety of mammal species, including horses, cattle, and buffaloes. In 2010-2012, the greatest outbreak of surra in Indonesia occurred on one of Indonesia's most remote islands, Sumba. This parasite has killed thousands of animals, particularly horses. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of T. evansi infection in healthy livestock (buffaloes, cattle, and horses) after the 8th outbreak in East Sumba using different methods, including serological test (CATT/T. evansi), parasitological test (WBF, Giemsa-stained blood smears (GSBS), and Microhematocrit Centrifugation Test (MHCT), and molecular method by PCR. The survey was conducted during the arid season, when the population of vectors was at its lowest. Blood samples were taken from 111 animals in three subdistricts in East Sumba (Lewa, Wulla Waijelu, and Kota Waingapu). Results revealed that the infection rate of livestock with T. evansi varies by animal species and detection methods. No positive sampel found by Micro Hematocrit Centrifugation Test (MHCT), wet blood film (WBF), and Giemza-stained blood smears (GSBS). The overall infection prevalence according CATT/T.evansi and PCR were 7.2%(8/111) and 5.4% (6/111); respectively. The infection rates by CATT T.evansi and PCR were as follows: horse, 0/57 (0%) and 1/ 57(1.75%); buffalo 5/23 (21.7%) and 13.04% (3/23); cattle, 3/31 (9.7%) and 2/31(6.45%); respectively. Buffalo and cattle have a higher prevalence of T. evansi compared to horses. The results of the present study indicate that cattle and buffalo may serve as a reservoir for T. evansi, which poses a high risk to horses due to the virulence of Surra when vector populations are abundant. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Recent climate change and global warming are likely to increase mosquito-borne diseases. Getah virus (GETV) is a mosquito-borne virus that infects horses and other mammals, including humans. Currently, GETV infection in horse sera is confirmed by the virus neutralization (VN) test. Therefore, there is a need for a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect GETV-antibody in a large number of horse serum samples. We aimed to develop a blocking ELISA (B-ELISA) method for the specific detection of GETV antibodies in horse serum samples. Antibodies against GETV in the sera of 175 horses were measured using the VN test. The purified QIAG9301-100P virus was used as an antigen for the B-ELISA. A monoclonal antibody (1E1) was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used as a detection antibody. For the establishment of the B-ELISA, antigen concentration, serum dilution factor, and conjugate dilution concentration were determined as 5 µg/mL, 20 times, and 3.6 µg/mL, respectively. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the B-ELISA using sera from 175 horses. The B-ELISA had a diagnostic sensitivity of 91.4%, a specificity of 94.0%, and an accuracy of 93.1% compared with that of the VN test. The B-ELISA was significantly correlated with the VN test (r = 0.83). The new B-ELISA could replace the VN test and be useful for the sero-surveillance of GETV in horse sera. It is also expected to be able to detect GETV antibodies in the serum of various animals including pigs. © 2023 Journal of Bacteriology and Virology.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horses mount a huge stress response to anesthesia when compared to other animals, hence are risky candidates for anesthesia. Inhalant anesthetic agents offer more control to anesthetic depth and facilitate rapid recovery, hence are considered to be safer than intravenous agents for surgical procedures requiring more than an hour, however, newer drug combinations are being explored to minimize the undesired consequences and dose rate of inhalant agents. The present study explored the safety of dexmedetomidine, ketamine and lidocaine constant rate infusion alone or as a combination along with Isoflurane for safer anesthesia in horses. Methods: The study was conducted on 28 horses divided into S, D, DK and DKL groups having 7 animals in each. Xylazine (1 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.05 mg/kg) were given intravenously for premedication. Ketamine (2 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) were used for induction and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. Normal saline (1000 ml/hour), Dexmedetomidine (2 μg/kg/hr), Dexmedetomidine and ketamine (2 µg/kg/hr and 2 mg/kg/hr) and Dexmedetomidine, ketamine and lidocaine (2 µg/kg/hr, 2 mg/kg/hr and 2 mg/kg/h) were given as CRI in groups S, D, DK and DKL, respectively. Thiopentone sodium (250 mg bolus, 5%) was given as a fast intravenous bolus whenever required. Anesthetic efficacy was evaluated based on clinical, haemato-biochemical, hemodynamic, and endocrine variables. Result: A significant decline in mean arterial pressure was noticed in group DKL but changes in CVP and SpO2 in different groups were non-significant. Higher Blood glucose and low Insulin levels were seen in group DK during 45-60 min. Constant rate infusions of Dexmedetomidine, Ketamine and Lidocaine alone or in combination produced a significant sparing effect on Isoflurane and thiopentone while they improved peri-operative quality of anesthesia in horses. © 2023 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: The gut of herbivorous animals is an untapped source of the microbial consortium that could be used to improve the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. This study investigated the hydrolysis of Timothy hay by the anaerobic incubation with fecal inocula from four cows (CB) and four horses (HB) for 72 h. The microbial communities colonized timothy hay were analyzed using Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing of 16S rDNA genes. The source of the inoculum affected the structure of microbial communities that were dominated by phylum Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, and the dominant genera were Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. Moreover, several bacteria were observed exclusively in a specific group. For example, group CB had phylum Fibrobacterota and Spirochaetota besides genera Prevotellaceae YAB2003 and Bacteroides; and group HB had genera Weissella and Lactococcus. Moreover, function prediction revealed that the CB group has a higher abundance of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. Group CB showed higher neutral detergent fiber degradability (NDFD), gas production, cellulase, xylanase, and xylose, and group HB showed higher dry matter degradability (DMD), glucose, ethanol, and lactic acid. The feces of cattle and horses represent a source of the bacterial consortium for enzyme production and the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Horses and donkeys are used for agriculture, leisure, urban services and therapy. Although these two species obviously behave differently, it is important to measure their behavioural specificity when tested in the same situations and to highlight the existence of some personality dimensions. During 104 breeding shows in France, personality tests validated for horses as measuring fearfulness and tactile sensitivity dimensions were applied to 1-year-old equids: 242 donkeys and 924 draught horses. In fear tests, compared to draught horses, donkeys in-hand moved less during height measurement ( P< 0.0001), walked less rapidly around a novel object (P< 0.015) and refused to move forward more often in front of a novel surface (P< 0.0001). During most tests, donkeys presented less tense posture and less evasive behaviours (P< 0.015). However, during suddenness tests, donkeys in-hand fled similarly to horses. Free in an open field with grass, donkeys walked as much as horses and grazed less (P< 0.0001). Finally, donkeys reacted more to filaments measuring tactile sensitivity (P< 0.0001). These results were often modulated by sex in horses with more reactions in males, and to a lesser degree in donkeys but with more reactions in females. Correlation and principal component analyses (PCA) of these individual characteristics within each species revealed stability of behaviours across fearful situations. In addition, PCA factor loadings revealed concordance between species (inter-factors 1: Kendall Tau = 0.33, P=0.021, inter-factors 2: Kendall Tau = 0.36, P=0.012). This suggested that the two species have similarities in their personality structure. In conclusion, young donkeys behave differently to young draught horses toward static novelties and tactile stimulation, but similarly when confronted with a visual surprise or free in an open field. However, there is probably an underlying common personality structure in the two species. For fearfulness to be considered as a personality dimension in donkeys, further studies are required to demonstrate its stability over time. These results have implications for animal welfare, because the fact that donkeys do not move does not mean that they are not afraid. Physiological measures and finer behavioural observations are required to characterise more precisely fear in donkeys. There are also implications for the safety of inexperienced people unaware of the danger of certain situations, particularly when equids considered to be placid are involved. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: A reduction in the egg reappearance period (ERP) has been suggested to be an early indication of emerging anthelmintic resistance in strongyles. Objective: To measure the strongyle ERP following moxidectin treatment of horses in the southeast of England. Study design: Prospective study. Methods: Horses with a faecal egg count (FEC) of ≥400 strongyle eggs per gram (EPG) in a routine screening sample were enrolled into the study. Moxidectin (400 μg/kg) was administered per os and FEC tests repeated every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. Results: Forty-eight horses completed the study. The mean EPG prior to treatment was 1047 (range 375–2137 EPG). In all but two horses, FEC was 0 EPG 2 weeks after moxidectin administration. In the remaining two, the FECs were each 12.5 EPG (97.8%–98.3% reductions compared to pre-treatment FEC). At 4 weeks post-treatment, 6 horses had positive FECs (96.6%–99.2% reductions). At 6 weeks, 11 horses had positive FECs (83.8% reduction in one horse; >90% reduction in 10). At 8 weeks, 21 horses exhibited positive FECs (<90% reduction in 2). At 10 weeks, 27 horses had positive FECs (<90% in 6). At 12 weeks, 31 horses had positive FECs (<90% reduction in 11). At 14 weeks, 34 horses had positive FECs (<90% reduction in 13). At 16 weeks, 38 horses had positive FECs (<90% reduction in 17). Main limitations: Weights of some horses were estimated using weigh tapes rather than a weighbridge. Dosing of the horses with moxidectin was carried out by owners. Conclusions: The results indicated acceptable efficacy of moxidectin at 14 days after treatment; however, the ERP pattern measured across the group suggests that this anthelmintic has a considerably shorter suppressive effect on strongyle egg shedding than measured when it was first introduced (12–16 weeks). © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Horses were domesticated later than other farm animals. Horse breeds have been selectively developed by humans to satisfy different needs and purposes. The factory and indigenous breeds are of particular interest, having been bred in purity for many centuries without the addition of foreign blood. Data from 31 stud farms, as well as ranches, located in fifteen regions of the Russian Federation were used in this work. DNA was sampled from 102 stallions of 11 breeds: Arabian, Akhal-Teke, Don, Orlov Trotter, Vladimir Heavy Draft, Russian Heavy Draft, Soviet Heavy Draft, Kabardin, Yakut, Tuva, and Vyatka. Data on the origin of each animal from which the material was collected were taken into account. DNA genotyping was carried out using GGP Equine 70 k ® array chips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Genetic diversity of horse breeds was estimated using Admixture 1.3. and PLINK 1.9 software. FROH inbreeding was computed via the R detectRUNS package. The minimum length for ROH was set at 1 Mb to reduce the occurrence of false positives. We conducted PCA analysis using PLINK 1.9, and used the ggplot2 library in R for visualizing the results. Indigenous equine breeds, such as Vyatka, Tuva, and Yakut, are very hardy, and well adapted to local environmental and climatic conditions. They are employed as draft power, as well as for milk and meat. Both the Akhal-Teke breed and the Arabian breed have retained a minimum effective population size over many generations. We note significant accumulations of homozygosity in these breeds. In equestrian sports, performance is a top priority. ADMIXTURE and PCA analyses showed similarities between Don equine breeds and Kabardin, as well as some Arabian breed animals. Earlier research indicated the presence of thoroughbred traits in Don stallions. The Orlov Trotter breed stands out as a separate cluster in the structural and PCA analyses. Considering the small population size of this breed, our study found high FROH in all tested animals. The general reduction in the diversity of the horse breed gene pool, due to numerous crosses for breed improvement with thoroughbreds, has lead to a decline in the differences between the top sporting breeds. Our study presents new opportunities for exploring the genetic factors that influence the formation of adaptive traits in indigenous breeds, and for finding ways to preserve genetic diversity for effective population reproduction. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The use of draught animals is still a reality in urban centers and has great economic and social relevance, serving as a driving force to capture recyclable materials or small freights and as a source of income for the population under vulnerability. The present research aimed to evaluate the morphometric parameters of horses used for traction in the urban region of Maceió, Alagoas, in order to identify the productive type and work capacity of the horses, based on their morphometric structure. A survey of the clinical register of 60 traction horses, from the Large Animal Release sector, was carried out at the Zoonoses Surveillance Unit (Unidade de Vigilância de Zoonoses - UVZ) of Maceió, Alagoas. The animals were submitted to zootechnical evaluation, with individual identification and measurement of morphometric measurements by the method of linear measurements and body circumferences. For this, a tape measure was used to measure the following variables: thoracic circumference (CTórax), body length (CCop.), withers height (ACern.), chest width (Lpeito) and cinnamon circumference (CCan.). From these measurements, the estimated weight was calculated and the morphometric indices were calculated: Body index (ICorp), compactness index 1 (Icomp.1), compactness index 2 (Icomp.2), conformation index (IConf) and the dactyl-thoracic index (TDI). In view of the results obtained, the aptitude of horses used in traction in the urban region of Maceió, Alagoas is for saddle, according to body indexes incompatible with what is characterized in the literature for traction activity. © 2024 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido

ABSTRACT: This research examined the antioxidant and cryoprotective effects of melatonin (ME) and caffeine (CAF) supplementation in freezing medium on the cryosurvival of Peruvian Paso horse sperm using a two-step accelerating cooling rate. Twenty ejaculates from four adult and fertile stallions were recovered, initially diluted with INRA-96®, and finally frozen with INRA-Freeze® with either no supplementation (as control), 1 mM ME, or 2 mM CAF using a two-ramp freezing system content inside a cryogenic-box and liquid nitrogen vapors. The sperm kinematic parameters and integrity of the plasma and acrosomal membranes of fresh semen and cryopreserved samples were evaluated using the CASA system (SCA-Evolution® 2018) and PI/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin double fluorescent test, respectively. The oxidative stress of post-thaw sperm samples was also assessed using the CellRox Deep Red fluorescence test. The results showed that curvilinear velocity and average-path velocity were greater (p < 0.05) after freezing with CAF than the control group. In addition, there were significance differences (p < 0.01) between stallions (1–4) in post-thaw kinematic parameters regardless of ME or CAF addition. Both ME and CAF improved (p < 0.05) the proportion of sperm with intact plasma membranes and intact acrosomes. Nevertheless, neither CAF nor ME improved the oxidative stress after the cryopreservation process. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Tabanidae (Horse-Flies or Deer-Flies) are one of the most economically important as well as medically significant haematophagous insect family within the order Diptera. Members of this group are also responsible for the mortality of substantial number of live-stock every year. Due to their pathogen transmission potential and vector competencies makes them an important insect group to study. Till now, mitochondrial genome of 18 species of tabanids were available. Methods and results: The complete mitogenome of three species T. diversifrons (15,809 bp), T. rubidus (15,878 bp) and T. tenens (15,872 bp) were generated by Next generation sequencing method. They consist 37 genes, with a positive AT skew and a negative GC skew. The gene order of these three species is similar to the typical gene arrangement of infra-order Tabanomorpha. Most of the tRNAs showed typical clover-leaf secondary structure except trnS1, which lacks the DHU arm. The sliding window analysis showed that the nad4L is the most conserved while atp8, and nad6 are the most variable genes. Moreover, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates indicated that all PCGs under the purifying selection. Phylogeny revealed Chrysops and Haematopota are monophyletic while species of Hybomitra are nested within the polyphyletic clade of Tabanus. T. diversifrons exhibits sister relationship with Atylotus miser. Two morphologically divergent species T. rubidus and T. tenens are found to be genetically similar and indistinguishable by mitochondrial genome. Conclusions: The hypervariable genes like atp8 and nad6 can be used as molecular markers for the identification of recently diverged lineages of family Tabanidae. Further, to address uncertainties arising from the two morphological divergent species, it is imperative to obtain data from nuclear gene markers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Effective diagnosis and therapy for bacterial infections, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) species, greatly challenge current antimicrobial stewardship. Monocytes, which can chemotactically migrate from the blood to infection site and elicit a robust infection infiltration, provide a golden opportunity for bacterial theranostics. Here, a nano-Trojan Horse was facilely engineered using mannose-functionalized manganese-eumelanin coordination nanoparticles (denoted as MP-MENP) for precise two-step localization and potent photothermal-immunotherapy of MDR bacterial infection. Taking advantage of the selective recognition between mannose and inflammation-associated monocytes, the MP-MENP could be passively piggybacked to infection site by circulating monocytes, and also actively target infiltrated monocytes that are already accumulated in infection microenvironment. Such dual-pronged targeting enabled an efficient imaging diagnosis of bacterial infection. Upon laser irradiation, the MP-MENP robustly produced local hyperemia to ablate bacteria, both extracellularly and intracellularly. Further combined with photothermal therapy-induced immunogenic cell death and MP-MENP-mediated macrophage reprogramming, the immunosuppressive infection microenvironment was significantly relieved, allowing an enhanced antibacterial immunity. Collectively, the proposed nanotheranostic Trojan Horse, which integrates dual-pronged targeting, precise imaging diagnosis, and high-performance photothermal immunotherapy, promises a new way for complete eradication of MDR bacterial infection. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The process of domestication of the horse introduced changes limiting accessibility to graze land and roughage while increasing highly digestible carbohydrates content of meal-fed rations. We have tested whether the effect of a higher degree of human contact impacts horses’ welfare by assessing the development of sharp enamel points (SEP) and buccal ulcerations (BU) in ridden and unridden horses. We were able to fit logistic regression models significantly differentiating the impact of these two conditions in both groups of horses (p < 0.001 for SEP and p < 0.01 for BU). The impact is higher in ridden horses for both conditions. These two conditions were found to correlate positively (ρ = 0.63, p < 0.001). We argued that human contact may impact on horses’ welfare. Further studies may help to clarify this impact with more detail. Dentistry may be helpful to provide improved welfare conditions; however, without regular access to grazed land, the stabled horses’ welfare may be at stake. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Horse chestnut (Aesculus chinensis) is an important medicinal tree that contains various bioactive compounds, such as aescin, barrigenol-type triterpenoid saponins (BAT), and aesculin, a glycosylated coumarin. Herein, we report a 470.02 Mb genome assembly and characterize an Aesculus-specific whole-genome duplication event, which leads to the formation and duplication of two triterpenoid biosynthesis-related gene clusters (BGCs). We also show that AcOCS6, AcCYP716A278, AcCYP716A275, and AcCSL1 genes within these two BGCs along with a seed-specific expressed AcBAHD6 are responsible for the formation of aescin. Furthermore, we identify seven Aesculus-originated coumarin glycoside biosynthetic genes and achieve the de novo synthesis of aesculin in E. coli. Collinearity analysis shows that the collinear BGC segments can be traced back to early-diverging angiosperms, and the essential gene-encoding enzymes necessary for BAT biosynthesis are recruited before the splitting of Aesculus, Acer, and Xanthoceras. These findings provide insight on the evolution of gene clusters associated with medicinal tree metabolites. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

ABSTRACT: Background: Traditional Mongolian endurance training is an effective way to improve the athletic ability of the horse for endurance events and is widely used. This incorporates aerobic exercise and intermittent fasting and these altered physiologic conditions are associated with switches between muscle fibre types. Objectives: To better understand the adaption of horse skeletal muscle to traditional Mongolian endurance training from muscle fibre characteristics and transcriptional levels and to explore possible molecular mechanisms associated with the endurance performance of horses. Study design: Before-after study. Methods: Muscle fibre type switches and muscle transcriptome changes in six Mongolian horses were assessed during 4 weeks of training. Transcriptomic and histochemical analyses were performed. The activities of oxidative and glycolytic metabolic enzymes were analysed and we generated deep RNA-sequencing data relating to skeletal muscles. Results: A fast-to-slow muscle fibre transition occurred in horse skeletal muscles, with a concomitant increase of oxidative enzyme activity and decreased glycolytic enzyme activity. Numerous differentially expressed genes were involved in the control of muscle protein balance and degradation. Differential alternative splicing events were also found during training which included exon-skipping events in Ttn that were associated with muscle atrophy. Differentially expressed noncoding RNAs showed connections with muscle protein balance-related pathways and fibre type specification via the post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA. Main limitations: The study focuses on horse athletic ability only from the aspect of muscular adaptation. Conclusion: Traditional Mongolian endurance training-induced muscle fibre transition and metabolic and transcriptional changes. Muscle-specific non-coding RNAs could contribute to these transcriptomic changes during training. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Equine tendinopathies are challenging because of the poor healing capacity of tendons commonly resulting in high re-injury rates. Within the tendon, different regions – tendon proper (TP) and peritenon (PERI) – contribute to the tendon matrix in differing capacities during injury and aging. Aged tendons have decreased repair potential; the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic changes that occur in the TP and PERI regions are not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess TP and PERI regional differences in adolescent, midlife, and geriatric horses using RNA sequencing and DNA methylation techniques. Results: Differences existed between TP and PERI regions of equine superficial digital flexor tendons by age as evidenced by RNASeq and DNA methylation. Cluster analysis indicated that regional distinctions existed regardless of age. Genes such as DCN, COMP, FN1, and LOX maintained elevated TP expression while genes such as GSN and AHNAK were abundant in PERI. Increased gene activity was present in adolescent and geriatric populations but decreased during midlife. Regional differences in DNA methylation were also noted. Notably, when evaluating all ages of TP against PERI, five genes (HAND2, CHD9, RASL11B, ADGRD1, and COL14A1) had regions of differential methylation as well as differential gene expression. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: This audit was conducted as it was noted that intravenous fluid therapy (IVFT) was not as precise as anticipated. The aim was to enhance the precision of IVFT given to patients. Objectives: To (1) quantify the discrepancies in intravenous fluid administered to patients compared to prescribed volumes; (2) investigate causative factors, and develop an action plan to improve care quality and (3) assess the effectiveness of implemented changes. Study design: A clinical audit was conducted. Clinical notes from horses receiving IVFT from January to June 2020 were analysed. Methods of improvement were discussed and implemented and a re-audit was then conducted from January to June 2021. Methods: A 24-h period was divided into a day-time period from 08:00 AM to 18:00 PM and a night period from 18:00 PM to 08:00 AM and the prescribed fluid volume was compared to the actual volume administered to ICU patients during these periods. For the re-audit, modifications were made, including the use of a modified analogue scale to quantify the remaining fluid volume in the bags, and revised recording sheets for intensive care and fluid therapy. Results: In 2020, 19/73 horses had records eligible for analysis. Horses received within 5 L of the prescribed volume in 14/53 (26%) time periods recorded. In 2021, 88/105 horses were eligible for data analysis. Horses received within 5 L of the prescribed volume in 156/220 (71%) time periods recorded. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the difference in fluid volume prescribed and received between 2020 and 2021. The obtained p value of 0.0001295 revealed a significant difference between the 2 years, suggesting that the observed variation in fluid volume was not by chance. Conclusions: The clinical audit facilitated demonstrable improvement and enhanced the standard of care. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Acetaminophen is used clinically in horses with musculoskeletal pain; however, no studies have been performed in horses with chronic lameness. Objectives: To determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of chronic dosing of acetaminophen in horses with naturally occurring chronic lameness. Study design: Longitudinal. Methods: Twelve adult horses with chronic lameness were treated with acetaminophen (30 mg/kg PO) every 12 h for 21 days. Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen were analysed on days 7 and 21 via LC–MS/MS and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Lameness was evaluated by body-mounted inertial sensor (BMIS) and 10-point subjective lameness score on day 21 and compared to untreated baseline evaluation on day 35. Clinicopathological analysis (n = 12), hepatic biopsy (n = 6) and gastroscopy (n = 6) were evaluated on days −1 and 22. Results: Maximum plasma acetaminophen concentration (Cmax) was 20.83 ± 10.25 μg/mL at time (Tmax) 0.40 ± 0.22 h on day 7. The Cmax on day 21 was 17.33 ± 6.91 μg/mL with a Tmax of 0.67 ± 0.26 h. Subjective lameness scores significantly improved at 2 and 4 h post-treatment; Significant percent improvement was detected in PDmax for horses with hindlimb lameness at 1, 2 and 8 h post-treatment. There were no significant differences in gastroscopy or hepatic biopsy scores between days −1 and 22. Main limitations: Small sample size, multi-limb lameness of varying severity and aetiology, lack of intermediary lameness evaluation. Conclusions: In horses with naturally occurring chronic lameness, acetaminophen at 30 mg/kg produced a transient improvement in subjective lameness and BMIS evaluation. Acetaminophen may not be effective as a monotherapy. Acetaminophen was safe following 21 days of 30 mg/kg PO every 12 h, with no evidence of clinically significant changes in clinicopathological analysis, hepatic biopsy or gastric ulceration scores. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to assess the stress responses associated with vaquejada simulating tests (VSTs). Ten clinically healthy 8.9 ± 4.3-year-old Quarter horses, weighing 441.3 ± 25.0 kg, performed two VSTs five days apart. In the first VST (M1), animals ran three times with a 5-min rest between races; and in the second (M2), they ran with a 15-min rest between races. Horses were examined before (T0) and immediately after the third run (T1) and at 4 h (T2) of recovery. Stress biomarkers included heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), cortisol, and white blood cell count. All variables were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey tests, considering p < 0.05. A significant reduction in cortisol was observed for pull (p = 0.0463) and helper (p = 0.0349) horses when they had a 15-min rest between races. The rMSSD and mean R-R values for helper horses were also significantly lower in M2. In conclusion, the 15-min rest interval proved to be better than the 5-min period for both categories of equine athletes used in vaquejada mainly for helper horses. A longer rest time between races allowed the organic recovery necessary for these animals to impose a greater applied physical effort load, which is a fact that guarantees good performance and well-being. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Injuries and sudden death during the cross-country (XC) phase of eventing have raised interest in the frequency and types of cardiac arrhythmias occurring in these equine athletes. Objectives: To characterise the frequency and types of rhythm disturbances and examine possible risk factors for premature depolarisations (PDs) occurring during the XC phase of United States Eventing Association (USEA) and Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI)-sanctioned events. Study design: Prospective, cross-sectional study. Methods: Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were obtained from horses prior to, during and immediately following the XC competition. Physiological rhythms pre-XC were included in the arrhythmia group for analysis. The frequency of PDs was calculated for all horses, as well as by division. PDs were categorised by complexity (singles, couplets, triplets, complex) and variably grouped for statistical analysis. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the presence of specific cardiac arrhythmia groupings during XC. Results: PDs were identified in 42/75 horses (56% [45, 67]) during XC. Horses competing in the upper divisions of eventing had higher odds for having any PD during XC compared to the lower divisions (OR = 17.5 [4.3, 72.01], p = 0.006). The amount of time the heart rate (HR) was greater than 199 beats per minute (BPM) was associated with more complex arrhythmias (triplets, salvos and tachyarrhythmias) (OR = 1.01 [1.0, 1.02], p = 0.005). An arrhythmia at rest (physiological or PD) was associated with arrhythmia in the early recovery period (OR = 3.5 [1.1, 10.8], p = 0.03). Main limitations: Convenience sampling and technical challenges of continuous ECG recordings under competition settings limited the number of enrollments. Conclusions: PDs were seen in a high percentage of horses during the XC competition. Upper levels and time the HR was greater than 199 BPM were related to PD presence and complexity. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: In modern times, horses are utilized not only for labour and transportation purposes but also for recreational activities such as competition and pleasure riding. In these various pursuits, the role of vision plays a crucial role. Electroretinography is the most used test to diagnose diseases of the retinal outer segment. There is a wide variety of devices to perform the electroretinography differing one from each other in the corneal electrode and the light stimulation. The Koijman electrode has been tested in dogs but not in horses. The main purpose of this study was to compare electroretinography parameters from horses sedated with detomidine alone or in combination with butorphanol, during a standardized protocol using the Koijman electrode and RETI-port® system. Seven mares were allocated to the detomidine and detomidine plus butorphanol group in a randomised, controlled, crossover study. Friedman and Willcoxon-signed ranked tests were used to compare the electroretinogram parameters. A Student’s t-test was used to compare differences in the number of artefacts to valid values ratio obtained under both sedation protocols. Results: Dark adaptation peaked after 16 min under scotopic conditions in both groups. No significant differences in electroretinogram parameters between groups were observed. During the mixed rod and cone response evaluation under scotopic conditions, all mares made a movement of the head resulting in a high number of artefacts. The detomidine plus butorphanol group showed a non-significant tendency to have fewer artefacts and a longer duration of sedation compared to the detomidine group. Conclusions: Detomidine alone or combined with butorphanol may be suitable to use Koijman electrode and the RETI-port® to perform a standardized long protocol in horses with some adaptations. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was to investigate the efficacy of a moxidectin pour-on solution for the treatment of Chorioptes bovis infestation in Belgian draft horses, and in addition, to evaluate the effect of this treatment on the clinical signs and lesions associated with chronic progressive lymphedema (CPL). Nineteen privately owned Belgian draft horses were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (moxidectin pour-on formulation, n = 10) or a placebo group (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), n = 9). On Day 0, all 19 horses tested positive for the presence of C. bovis in superficial skin scrapings. Prior to treatment, all feathering on the distal limbs of the horses was clipped. Treatment was applied twice (Day 0 and 7). Pour-on moxidectin (Cydectin 0.5% Pour-On; Zoetis) was evenly distributed over the distal legs of the horses at a dose of 1.5 mg moxidectin/kg body weight. Animals in the placebo group were treated with PBS. Pretreatment and follow-up examinations consisted of counting living mites in superficial skin scrapings, scoring pruritus, and scoring mange-associated and CPL-associated lesions (skinfold score and skin lesion score). Horses in the placebo group and moxidectin group were followed up to 8 weeks and 24 weeks after the first treatment, respectively. On Day 14, no living mites were found in any of the horses in the moxidectin group (p = 0.013). These horses continued to remain free of mites, until the final sampling conducted at 24 weeks following the initial application of moxidectin, when three horses again showed living mites in skin scrapings. Treatment with moxidectin resulted in a significant reduction of both CPL-associated skin lesion scores (p = 0.003) and pruritus scores (p = 0.001) after only seven days. By Day 56, still no signs of pruritus (p < 0.0001) were detected, with significant improvement of mange-associated lesions (p < 0.0001). Although the skinfold score did not show a significant reduction by Day 56, the score for skin lesions associated with CPL had significantly improved (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that pour-on moxidectin, at a high dose and applied directly to the mite predilection site, was an effective treatment for C. bovis infestation in feathered draft horses, providing positive effects on CPL lesions, pruritus and mange-associated lesions. Furthermore, these findings emphasize the therapeutic significance of addressing mange in the management of CPL-affected draft horses. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A lack of accurate information on the prevalence and distribution of Anoplocephala spp. infections on horse farms has led to insufficient attention to tapeworm control and increasing horse anoplocephaloses in Europe. Our study aimed to examine the occurrence of Anoplocephala spp. infection using coprological, serum- and saliva-based antibody detection methods and to analyze the risk factors associated with tapeworm infection in domestic horses in Slovakia. Fecal, serum, and saliva samples were collected from 427 horses from 31 farms in Slovakia. Additionally, a questionnaire study was conducted to collect information on tapeworm distribution on horse farms and analyze risk factors associated with infection. Fecal samples were examined by the mini-FLOTAC and the double centrifugation/combined sedimentation-flotation techniques. Serum and saliva samples were analyzed by ELISA to determine antibody levels against Anoplocephala spp. The effects of variables associated with an individual horse were tested for the positive result of the saliva ELISA test on Anoplocephala spp. Cestode eggs were detected in 1.99% of fecal samples (farm prevalence 12.90%), with no differences between the two coprological methods. Serum-based tapeworm ELISA results revealed that 39.39% of horses tested positive (farm prevalence 83.87%); while saliva-based tapeworm ELISA results revealed 56.95% positive horses (farm prevalence 96.77%). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed four meaningful predictors that significantly impacted the likelihood of detecting tapeworm infection in horses: horse age, pasture size, anthelmintic treatment scheme, and access to pasture. The influences of other variables associated with an individual horse were not significantly associated with detecting tapeworm infection. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The utilization of Autologous Conditioned Serum (ACS) for treating osteoarthritis (OA) in horses has seen a notable increase in recent years. In vitro studies have consistently identified ACS as a promising therapy for OA joints, contributing to its growing popularity in OA treatment. Despite this, there is a noticeable absence of systematic reviews focused solely on the clinical data of OA patients treated with ACS, excluding the in vitro perspective. This study aims to address this gap by systematically reviewing the latest literature, concentrating solely on clinical data in in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy of ACS in OA lesions. All clinical studies involving ACS treatments for horses with OA were included in the assessment. Surprisingly, only six trials met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The results indicate that the majority of the considered articles support the use of ACS as a treatment for horses, albeit with a control group provided in only one study. However, the absence of a control group and the exclusion of histological evaluation diminish the validity of the majority of clinical research. While several studies suggest a beneficial effect of ACS on OA horses without significant adverse effects, this systematic review affirms that there is no definitive evidence for its effectiveness. Therefore, further investigation of the efficacy of ACS products as a treatment for OA is warranted, emphasizing the need for more controlled trials. Poorly designed and biased studies, lacking blinding or control and adopting inadequate outcome measures, may favor positive results and, thus, necessitate a more rigorous approach to validate the efficacy of ACS in OA treatment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: There are conflicting data in studies on malformations of the cervicothoracic (C-T) junction (C6 to T2, including the first and second ribs), but evidence is mounting that they can be of clinical significance for horses. The objectives of this study were to establish a radiographic protocol for imaging the C-T junction in the field and to classify the radiographic variations found in 39 warmblood horses presented for clinical evaluation due to behavioral or performance issues. Malformations of the ventral lamina of C6 and transposition onto the ventral aspect of C7 were seen in 37/39 (94.9%) horses for both conditions. Rib anomalies were found among the horses with C6 and C7 malformations. A missing first rib, unilateral or bilateral, was found in 3/35 (11.4%) horses, a unilateral shortening of the rib in 17/35 (48.6%) horses, a bilateral shortening of the ribs in 12/35 (34.3%) horses, bifid ribs in 3/35 (8.6%) horses, and only 4/35 (11.4%) horses had a normal length of the first rib on both sides. There was a moderately to highly significant association between the grades of left and right malformations of C6 and C7 and first ribs as well as between C6 and C7. A large number of malformations were visualized radiographically at the C-T junction using the newly described methods of latero-lateral and oblique radiographic projections, which allows for these features to be identified in living horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Movements of the horse and rider in equestrian sports are governed by the laws of physics. An understanding of these physical principles is a prerequisite to designing and interpreting biomechanical studies of equestrian sports. This article explains and explores the biomechanical effects between riders and horses, including gravitational and inertial forces, turning effects, and characteristics of rider technique that foster synchronous movement with the horse. Rider symmetry, posture, and balance are discussed in the context of their relationship to rider skill level and their effects on the horse. Evidence is presented to support the feasibility of improving equestrian performance by off-horse testing followed by unmounted therapy and exercises to target the identified deficiencies. The elusive quality of harmony, which is key to a true partnership between riders and horses, is explored and described in biomechanical terms. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The autonomic regulation of heart rate (HR) is an indicator of the body’s ability to adapt to an exercise stimulus. However, there are no reports on this topic in relation to Jeju horses used for racing. The aim of this study was to analyze the HR responses of Jeju horses during race trials and to investigate the correlation between HR and performance in these horses. HR data were collected from 17 healthy 2-to 7-year-old Jeju horses wearing HR monitors during race trials. Pearson correlation coefficients was used to determine the significance of the association between the race trial time and HR. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the race trial time (performance) and both the maximal HR (HRmax, r = –0.69, p < 0.01) and HR reserve (HRR) (HRmax – average HR during the warm-up period, r = –0.63, p < 0.01) and between the HRR and HRmax (r = 0.73, p < 0.01). Horses with a lower average HR during the warm-up period and higher heart rates during the trial achieved faster race trial times. This study reports the first HR measurements in Jeju horses during race trials, providing new insights into the HR response of this breed to exercise. The use of a noninvasive remote HR monitor system allowed assessment of exercise responses in the field, and the results suggest that both the HRR during warm-up period and HRmax may be useful performance indicators in Jeju horses. © The Korean Society of Veterinary Clinics.

ABSTRACT: Characterization studies must be prioritized to allow the maintenance of the racial standard to guarantee the conservation of their genes of origin. The Nordestina breed is a small animal, not exceeding 150 cm for males and 145 cm for females, with a body weight of approximately 280 kg in both sexes. The objective of this research was to compare the conventional method and the imaging method (ImageJ® software) in the performance of morphometric measurements of horses of the Nordestina breed. The morphometric measurements performed were withers height (WH), croup height (CH), body length (BL), neck length (NL), side height (SH), pelvic girdle height (PGH), shin perimeter (SP), chest circumference (CC), face length (FL) and face width (FW). Head length (P=0.045), head width (P=0.001), and shin perimeter (P<.0001) showed a significant difference between the two methods evaluated, these measurements presented higher values when performed by image, but did not present a coefficient of variation greater than 8%. The total canonical correlation between the sets of variables X and Y were 0.99, and the first pair of canonical variables absorbed 85% of the total variation, whose Wilk’s and F test (P<0.001) were significant for all canonical pairs, which indicates a strong correlation between the measurements obtained by the conventional method and by imaging. The evaluation of photographs by the ImageJ® software proved to be a viable alternative to the conventional method of taking morphometric measurements in horses of the Nordestina breed. © 2024 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido

ABSTRACT: Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdc., commonly known as horse gram, is an important source of nutrients in human but its nutrients are lost by the post-harvest infestation of Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). The biology, life table parameters and resistance of C. chinensis on four horse gram cultivars (AK 21, ANK Black, Paiyur 2 and Urmi) were evaluated. Nutrients (total proteins, carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and nitrogen) and antinutrients (total phenols, tannins and flavonols) of these cultivars were estimated. Further, insect embryogenesis and several key digestive enzymes of C. chinensis larvae were studied on these four cultivars. Callosobruchus chinensis showed longer development time, lower fecundity and lower survival rate on Urmi due to lower amounts of nutrients and higher amounts of antinutrients than other cultivars. Adult emergence also decreased on Urmi. Based on growth index, Urmi is moderately resistant. The relative growth rate of C. chinensis was lowest on Urmi. The rm, R0 and λ of C. chinensis were lowest in Urmi, suggesting the lower increase of C. chinensis population on Urmi than other three cultivars. Larval post-embryonic development (cellular blastoderm formation, germ band extension or retraction, segmentation of embryo and dorsal closure) was delayed on Urmi than other cultivars. α-Amylase, cysteine protease, α-glucosidase and lipase enzyme activities were reduced in larvae developed on Urmi than other cultivars. Therefore, we could recommend the use of moderately resistant Urmi cultivar as a way to lessen C. chinensis infestation, and suggesting resistance mechanism is due to reduced activities of key digestive enzymes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study describes 8 cases of intestinal hemangioma diagnosed in horses during postmortem examination or surgical biopsy at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine. In all cases, the intestine was the sole organ affected, and lesions were focal (3/8) or multifocal (5/8). Nodules were most commonly within the small intestine (7/8), particularly the jejunum (5/7). One case was in the left dorsal colon, which is the first report of hemangioma in the large colon of a horse. Lesions were discrete, raised, smooth, black to red, and ranged from 2 to 15 mm in diameter. Microscopically, all lesions were cavernous type and mural, most frequently within the muscularis (6/8). A majority of cases occurred in middle aged to older horses (average age of 19.3 years), and no breed or sex predilections were identified. The hemangiomas were considered incidental findings. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: Anaerobic fungi are effective fibre-degrading microorganisms in the digestive tract of horses. However, our understanding of their diversity and community structure is limited, especially in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Results: For the first time, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyse and predict fungal microbial diversity in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract of Mongolian horses. The results revealed that the richness and diversity of fungi in the hindgut of Mongolian horses were much higher than those in the foregut. The foregut was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota, whereas the hindgut was dominated by Neocallimastigomycota and Basidiomycota. At the genus level, the relative abundance of many pathogenic fungi (Cryptococcus, Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Sarocladium) in the foregut was significantly higher than that in the posterior gut, indicating that Mongolian horses have strong disease resistance. The prediction of fungal function also showed significant differences in the fungal flora between the foregut and the hindgut. The fungi in Mongolian horses’ foreguts were mainly pathologically nutritive and contained many animal and plant pathogens, particularly in the small intestine (jejunum and ileum). This indicates that the foregut may be the most important immune site in the digestive system of Mongolian horses, which explains the high disease resistance of Mongolian horses. The number of unassigned functional groups in the posterior gut was significantly higher than that in the anterior gut, indicating that the functions of fungal groups in the posterior gut have not been fully explored, and further studies are required in the future. Conclusions: Analysis of high-throughput sequencing results revealed that the fungal composition varied greatly among different gastrointestinal tract segments in Mongolian horses, whose hindgut contains many anaerobic fungi involved in plant cellulose degradation. This provides important basic data for studying fungal diversity in the digestive system of healthy horses, which can be used for the health assessment of horses and provides clues for further research on the disease resistance and digestive capacity of horses, as well as a reference for the early diagnosis of intestinal diseases and innovative treatment methods. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii) is the only surviving wild horse species in the world. A significant population of Przewalski's horses resides in Xinjiang, China. Parasitosis poses a considerable threat to the conservation of this endangered species. Yet, there is limited information on the nematode parasites that infect these species. To deepen our understanding of parasitic fauna affecting wild horses, we identified the intestinal nematodes of Przewalski’s horses in Xinjiang and added new barcode sequences to a public database. Methods: Between 2018 and 2021, nematodes were collected from 104 dewormed Przewalski's horses in Xinjiang. Each nematode was morphologically identified to the species level, and selected species underwent DNA extraction. The extracted DNA was used for molecular identification through the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) genetic marker. Results: A total of 3758 strongylids were identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify four specific parasitic nematodes (Oesophagodontus robustus, Bidentostomum ivashkini, Skrjabinodentus caragandicus, Petrovinema skrjabini) and to obtain the ITS2 genetic marker for P. skrjabini. Conclusions: The ITS2 genetic marker for P. skrjabini enriches our understanding of the genetic characteristics of this species and expands the body of knowledge on parasitic nematodes. Our findings extend the known host range of four strongylid species, thereby improving our understanding of the relationship between Przewalski’s horses and strongylids. This, in turn, aids in the enhanced conservation of this endangered species. This study introduces new instances of parasitic infections in wild animals and offers the DNA sequence of P. skrjabini as a valuable resource for molecular techniques in nematode diagnosis among wildlife.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the central and third tarsal bones of 23 equine fetuses and foals were examined using micro-computed tomography. Radiological changes, including incomplete ossification and focal ossification defects interpreted as osteochondrosis, were detected in 16 of 23 cases. The geometry of the osteochondrosis defects suggested they were the result of vascular failure, but this requires histological confirmation. The study aim was to examine central and third tarsal bones from the 16 cases and to describe the tissues present, cartilage canals, and lesions, including suspected osteochondrosis lesions. Cases included 9 males and 7 females from 0 to 150 days of age, comprising 11 Icelandic horses, 2 standardbred horses, 2 warmblood riding horses, and 1 coldblooded trotting horse. Until 4 days of age, all aspects of the bones were covered by growth cartilage, but from 105 days, the dorsal and plantar aspects were covered by fibrous tissue undergoing intramembranous ossification. Cartilage canal vessels gradually decreased but were present in most cases up to 122 days and were absent in the next available case at 150 days. Radiological osteochondrosis defects were confirmed in histological sections from 3 cases and consisted of necrotic vessels surrounded by ischemic chondronecrosis (articular osteochondrosis) and areas of retained, morphologically viable hypertrophic chondrocytes (physeal osteochondrosis). The central and third tarsal bones formed by both endochondral and intramembranous ossification. The blood supply to the growth cartilage of the central and third tarsal bones regressed between 122 and 150 days of age. Radiological osteochondrosis defects represented vascular failure, with chondrocyte necrosis and retention, or a combination of articular and physeal osteochondrosis. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The tick-borne obligatory intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects granulocytes of humans as well as domesticated and wild animals, causing a febrile disease collectively called granulocytic anaplasmosis. The host species specificity and zoonotic potential of A. phagocytophilum strains remain unclear. In the USA, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is primarily reported in Wisconsin and Minnesota, the northeastern coastal states, and northern California. In horses, A. phagocytophilum causes equine granulocytic anaplasmosis (EGA). Although EGA has been reported in the same US regions as HGA, horses with a definitive diagnosis of EGA have not been reported in Ohio, where the incidence of HGA is low. In this study, samples from archived blood smears or whole blood from three horses from three different counties in Ohio that presented in 2018, 2020, and 2021 with clinical signs and laboratory findings consistent with EGA were evaluated by PCR and sequencing. Sequences of ankA (encoding ankyrin A) of the three A. phagocytophilum strains were identical and related to strains isolated from humans in the northeastern USA yet distinct from those in California or Europe based on phylogenetic analysis. Each Ohio strain contains unique A. phagocytophilum p44 genes encoding the immunodominant major outer membrane proteins, underscoring the antigenic diversity of A. phagocytophilum strains that cause EGA in Ohio. From 2018 to 2023, 14 additional cases of EGA were identified by serodiagnosis in Ohio and nearby locations in Pennsylvania, pointing to a heretofore unrecognized prevalence of EGA and the risk of transmission of anaplasmosis to humans and animals in this region. IMPORTANCE The tick-borne obligatory intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects humans as well as domesticated and wild animals, causing a febrile disease collectively called granulocytic anaplasmosis. The epidemiology and the host species specificity and zoonotic potential of A. phagocytophilum strains remain unclear. In this study, ankA (encoding ankyrin A) and p44 gene sequences of A. phagocytophilum were determined in clinical specimens from horses in Ohio and compared with those found in A. phagocytophilum strains from various hosts and geographic regions. With increasing numbers of seropositive horses, the study points out the unrecognized prevalence and uncharacterized strains of A. phagocytophilum infection in horses and the importance of A. phagocytophilum molecular testing for the prevention of equine and human granulocytic anaplasmosis.

ABSTRACT: The erythropoietin mimetic peptide 1 linear form (EMP1-linear), GGTYSCHFGPLTWVCKPQGG-NH2, was identified in an unknown preparation consisting of white crystalline powder contained in sealed glass vials using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). The white crystalline powder, allegedly used for doping racehorses, was found to contain around 2% (w/w) of EMP1-linear. EMP1-linear can be cyclised in equine plasma at physiological temperature of 37°C by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond to give EMP1, which is a well-known erythropoiesis stimulating agent that can bind to and activate the receptor for cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). Thus, EMP1-linear is a prodrug of EMP1, which is a performance-enhancing doping agent that can be misused in equine sports. In order to identify potential target(s) for detecting the misuse of EMP1-linear in horses, an in vitro metabolic study using horse liver S9 fraction was performed. After incubation, EMP1-linear mainly existed in its cyclic form as EMP1, and four N-terminus truncated in vitro metabolites TYSCHFGPLTWVCKPQGG-NH2 (M1), SCHFGPLTWVCKPQGG-NH2 (M2), WVCKPQGG-NH2 (M3) and VCKPQGG-NH2 (M4) were identified. An intravenous administration study with the preparation of white crystalline powder containing EMP1-linear was also conducted using three retired thoroughbred geldings. EMP1 was detectable only in the postadministration plasma samples, whereas the four identified in vitro metabolites were detected in both postadministration plasma and urine samples. For controlling the misuse of EMP1-linear in horse, its metabolite M3 gave the longest detection time in both plasma and urine and could be detected for up to 4 and 27 h postadministration, respectively. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Phospholipase C Zeta 1 (PLCZ1) is considered a major sperm-borne oocyte activation factor. After gamete fusion, PLCZ1 triggers calcium oscillations in the oocyte, resulting in oocyte activation. In assisted fertilization, oocyte activation failure is a major cause of low fertility. Most cases of oocyte activation failures in humans related to male infertility are associated with gene mutations and/or altered PLCZ1. Consequently, PLCZ1 evaluation could be an effective diagnostic marker and predictor of sperm fertilizing potential for in vivo and in vitro embryo production. The characterization of PLCZ1 has been principally investigated in men and mice, with less known about the PLCZ1 impact on assisted reproduction in other species, such as cattle and horses. In horses, sperm PLCZ1 varies among stallions, and sperm populations with high PLCZ1 are associated with cleavage after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In contrast, bull sperm is less able to initiate calcium oscillations and undergo nuclear remodeling, resulting in poor cleavage after ICSI. Advantageously, injections of PLCZ1 are able to rescue oocyte failure in mouse oocytes after ICSI, promoting full development and birth. However, further research is needed to optimize PLCZ1 diagnostic tests for consistent association with fertility and to determine whether PLCZ1 as an oocyte-activating treatment is a physiological, efficient, and safe method for improving assisted fertilization in cattle and horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The current study aimed to evaluate the genetic diversity, level of admixture, and phylogenetic relationship, of the Pakistani horse breeds, along with their morphological characterization. Data for the body measurements showed that Morna horses had the highest values of body height, body length, chest girth, leg length, and head length, whereas the Baluchi horses had the lowest values for these traits. For the genetic diversity 64 animals, 15/breed except for Baluchi(14) and Topras(05), were genotyped by using the 17-plex equine genotyping kit. The AMOVA results showed that 13% of genetic diversity was explained by breed differences, whereas 27% and 60% came from among and within individuals respectively. The highest values of genetic diversity parameters including Na(7.29±0.29), Ne(5.73±0.28), Ho(0.74±0.05) and He(0.82±0.01) were observed for Morna, whereas their lowest values were found for Topras. However, the highest value of inbreeding coefficient (Fis) was found for Baluchi and the lowest for KB horses. Among the markers, CA425 was found as the most polymorphic and ASB23 as the least polymorphic and highly fixed marker. Results of structure analysis revealed that, except Topras, each local horse breed had very admixed genetic structure perhaps due to their continuous crossing with other breeds in the past. Moreover, the structure analysis also showed that Morna and Shiean breeds had mixing of each other which was also confirmed by the lowest value of their pairwise Fst values and likewise the phylogenetic analysis also showed their close genetic relationship with each other. The phylogenetic analysis also revealed that Shiean breed had close genetic relationship with Arabian horses. Collectively, our data showed that Morna is the largest and genetically most diverse horse breed of Pakistan, whereas Baluchi horses are the smallest in size and have the highest values of inbreeding coefficient. And the phylogeny analysis showed that Shiean breed had close genetic relationship with the Arabian. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This retrospective case series describes the use of progressive urethral dilation in 22 client-owned male horses undergoing perineal urethrotomy (PU) for cystolith removal. Medical records of horses undergoing PU and urethral dilation for treatment of cystolithiasis were reviewed. Dilation of the pelvic urethra was performed following PU and using customized dilators with the same length (30cm) and with various outer diameters (25 to 45mm). Analyzed data included: signalment, cystolith size, renal ultrasound findings, method used for cystolith removal, diameter of urethral dilators, intra- and post-operative complications, and hospitalization time. Cystolith size ranged between 37mm and 90mm. Dilation of the pelvic urethra was as follows: 35mm (n=8), 25mm (n=6), 39mm (n=3), 33mm (n=2), 28mm (n=2) and 45mm (n=1). In 6 cases, the cystolith was removed without fragmentation. In the remaining 16 horses, lithotripsy was performed with forceps (n=9) or a pneumatic scaler (n=7). In 15 horses a retrieval device was used to aid in calculi removal. Hospitalization time ranged between 1 and 5 days. Intra-operative complications occurred in one horse. No post-operative complications were recorded. Follow-up information was available for 21 horses (range 1-8 years). Urethral dilation via PU may be a viable option for cystolith removal in male horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Working horses support the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Egypt. No previous study has investigated the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in working horses in Egypt. Faecal samples were collected from 607 working horses recruited from thirty-seven villages/areas in two Egyptian governorates and examined for Cryptosporidium spp. infection using the modified Zielh-Neelsen staining technique. Data on signalment, history of recent diarrhoea, and strongyle burden were collected. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection was calculated using a bootstrap method and potential risk factors for infection were investigated using mixed-effects logistic regression models that included sampling location as a random-effects variable. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection was 28.7% (95% confidence interval = 23.5–33.9). None of the variables investigated, which include age, sex of the animals, and strongyle burden, were associated with risk of infection. This study provided evidence-based information on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in the study area. However, the potential zoonotic risk of Cryptosporidium cannot be confirmed until further studies are conducted to genotype these parasites. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: The inclusion of dexmedetomidine (DEX) within a balanced general anaesthesia protocol is effective in improving the clinical outcome and recovery quality of anaesthesia in horses. This study aimed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of DEX following repeated subcutaneous (SC) administration at 2 µg/kg every 60 min till the end of the procedure in comparison to intravenous constant rate infusion (CRI) at 1 µg/kg/h in anaesthetized horses undergoing diagnostic procedures up to the end of the diagnostic procedure. Results: In the CRI and SC groups DEX maximum concentrations (Cmax) were 0.83 ± 0.27 ng/mL and 1.14 ± 0.71 ng/mL, respectively, reached at a time (Tmax) of 57.0 ± 13.4 min and 105.5 ± 29.9 min. Mean residence time to the last measurable concentration (MRTlast) was 11.7 ± 6.2 and 55.8 ± 19.7 min for the CRI group and SC groups, respectively. The apparent elimination half-life was 18.0 ± 10.0 min in the CRI group and 94.8 ± 69.8 min for the SC group, whereas the area under the curve (AUC0-last) resulted 67.7 ± 29.3 and 83.2 ± 60.5 min*ng/mL for CRI and SC group, respectively. Clearance was 16.26 ± 8.07 mL/min/kg for the CRI group. No signs of adverse effects were recorded in both groups. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic profile of DEX following repeated SC administration in anaesthetized horses was comparable to intravenous CRI administration during the intranaesthetic period and beneficial during the recovery phase from general anaesthesia. The SC route could be considered as an alternative to CRI for improving the recovery quality of equine patients undergoing general anaesthesia. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The emporion of Pech Maho was destroyed after a warlike event at the end of the third century BC. Shortly after that, around 200 BC, the site was resettled. This reuse is characterised above all by massive deposits of equid carcasses in various locations around the city. The conditions of these deposits are investigated in this paper. We focus on examining several biological parameters (weight, age and sex) of the equid population, as well as their feeding habits, using three different proxies: stable isotope, dental meso- and microwear. This interdisciplinarity gives us access to the overall equid diet, as well as to the diet during the last phases of their lives. This population is largely dominated by small size young adult males. Isotopic as well as morphometric analyses indicate that they were bred in various locations before being brought to Pech Maho. Dental wear analyses show that they experienced the same feeding throughout their lives and just before their death. The animals were all slaughtered within a short period of time. This study illustrates the advantages of combining proxies in order to enhance our understanding of the life and death conditions of Iron Age equids. © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2023.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of Ehrlichia spp. in horses and dogs in Iran. Blood samples were collected from 400 animals, including 200 horses and 200 dogs, from five different provinces in Iran. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Ehrlichia spp. based on amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. The semi-nested PCR method was used to amplify the dsb, TRP36, and gltA genes. The results showed that 4.5 % of the samples (3 % horses and 6 % dogs) were positive for Ehrlichia sp. The highest prevalence was observed in Kerman and Khuzestan, while the lowest was found in West Azerbaijan, Golestan, and Mazandaran. The study suggests that the populations of dogs and horses in the country should be considered important factors in the epidemiology of ehrlichiosis. Phylogenetic analysis based on the dsb and TRP36 genes revealed that the prevalent species were E. canis and E. ruminantium. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Objective: The objective of this study was to use shotgun label-free tandem mass spectrometry (LF-MS/MS) to evaluate aqueous humor (AH) from horses with uveitis (UH) compared to ophthalmologically healthy horses (HH). Animals Studied: Twelve horses diagnosed with uveitis based on ophthalmic examination and six ophthalmologically healthy horses (postmortem) purchased for teaching purposes. Procedures: All horses received a complete ophthalmic examination and physical exam. Aqueous paracentesis was performed on all horses and AH total protein concentrations were measured with nanodrop (TPn) and refractometry (TPr). AH samples were analyzed with shotgun LF-MS/MS and proteomic data were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: A total of 147 proteins were detected, 11 proteins had higher abundance in UH, and 38 proteins had lower abundance in UH. Proteins with higher abundance included apolipoprotein E, alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, prothrombin, fibrinogen, complement component 4 (C4), joining chain for IgA and IgM, afamin, and amine oxidase. There were positive correlations between TPn (p =.003) and TPr (p =.0001) compared to flare scores. Conclusion: Differential abundance of A2M, prothrombin, fibrinogen, and C4 indicate upregulation of the complement and coagulation cascade in equine uveitis. Proinflammatory cytokines and the complement cascade have potential as therapeutic targets for equine uveitis. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Zoonotic diseases pose a significant threat to public health. Chlamydia, as an intracellular pathogen, can colonize the intestinal tract of humans and animals, changing the gut microbiota. However, only a few studies have evaluated alterations in the gut microbiota of horses infected with Chlamydia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gut microbiota and serum biochemical indicators in horses with Chlamydial infection (IG) and healthy horses (HG). Fecal and blood samples were collected from 16 horses (IG: 10; HG: 6) before morning feeding for the determination of gut microbiota and serum biochemical parameters. Results: The results showed that total globulin (GLB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) levels were significantly increased in IG compared with HG. Notably, the gut microbial diversity increased in IG compared with HG. Furthermore, Moraxellaceae and Akkermanisa abundance decreased in IG, while Streptococcus, Treponema, Prevotella, and Paraprevotella abundances (13 genera of bacterial species) increased. Compared with HG, carbohydrate metabolism increased in IG while amino acid metabolism decreased. In addition, the abundance of 18 genera of bacteria was associated with the level of five serum biochemical indicators. Conclusions: In summary, this study elucidated the influence of Chlamydia infection in horses on the gut microbiota, unraveling consequential alterations in its composition and metabolic profile. Therefore, this study improves the understanding of Chlamydia-induced intestinal infections. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The Przewalski’s horse (Equus przewalskii Poljakov, 1881) is one of 13 species included in the List of Rare and Endangered Wildlife that require priority measures for restoration and reintroduction. The species is listed on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This is the last surviving species from a group of once numerous and diverse wild horses of Eurasia. Being of great interest to world science, the history of the discovery of the Przewalski’s horse, its description, systematics, other features of biology, issues of restoration, reintroduction deserve the special attention of researchers from both the former Soviet Union and pre-revolutionary and modern Russia, who stood at the origins of conservation of this species. The experience gained by the specialists of our country in the implementation of a number of international projects on the reintroduction of the Przewalski’s horse and the restoration of its natural populations served as the basis for the preparation of programs for the creation of breeding centers and the formation of its semi-free populations, which are implemented, first of all, on the territory of the Orenburgsky State Nature Reserve. A long-term strategy that has transparent mechanisms for coordination and interaction of all organizations involved in its implementation and provides for evidence-based approaches using modern research methods in its implementation will contribute to the successful implementation of the Program for the Restoration of the Przewalski’s Horse in the Russian Federation approved by the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia on April 8, 2022. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Studying animal societies needs detailed observation of many individuals, but technological advances offer new opportunities in this field. Here, we present a state-of-the-art drone observation of a multilevel herd of Przewalski’s horses, consisting of harems (one-male, multifemale groups). We track, in high spatio-temporal resolution, the movements of 238 individually identified horses on drone videos, and combine movement analyses with demographic data from two decades of population monitoring. Analysis of collective movements reveals how the structure of the herd’s social network is related to kinship and familiarity of individuals. The network centrality of harems is related to their age and how long the harem stallions have kept harems previously. Harems of genetically related stallions are closer to each other in the network, and female exchange is more frequent between closer harems. High movement similarity of females from different harems predicts becoming harem mates in the future. Our results show that only a few minutes of fine-scale movement tracking combined with high throughput data driven analysis can reveal the structure of a society, reconstruct past group dynamics and predict future ones. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

ABSTRACT: Background: Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that is sometimes administered in combination with epinephrine. The addition of epinephrine increases the time lidocaine remains at the site of administration, thus prolonging the duration of effect. Due to their potential to prevent the visual detection of lameness, the administration of local anesthetics is strictly regulated in performance and racehorses. Recent reports of positive regulatory findings for lidocaine in racehorses suggests a better understanding of the behavior of this drug is warranted. The objective of the current study was to describe serum and urine concentrations and the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and its primary metabolites following administration in combination with epinephrine, as a palmar digital nerve block in horses. Twelve horses received a single administration of 1 mL of 2% lidocaine HCl (20 mg/horse) with epinephrine 1:100,000, over the palmar digital nerve. Blood samples were collected up to 30 h and urine samples up to 48 h post administration. Lidocaine and metabolite concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry and pharmacokinetic (non-compartmental and compartmental) analysis was performed. Results: Serum concentrations of lidocaine and 3-hydroxylidocaine were above the LOQ of the assay at 30 h post administration and monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX) were below detectable levels by 24 and 48 h, respectively. In urine, lidocaine, MEGX and GX were all non-detectable by 48 h post administration while 3-hydroxylidocaine was above LOQ at 48 h post administration. The time of maximal concentration for lidocaine was 0.26 h (median) and the terminal half-life was 3.78 h (mean). The rate of absorption (Ka) was 1.92 1/h and the rate of elimination (Kel) was 2.21 1/h. Conclusions: Compared to previous reports, the terminal half-life and subsequent detection time observed following administration of lidocaine in combination with epinephrine is prolonged. This is likely due to a decrease in systemic uptake of lidocaine because of epinephrine induced vasoconstriction. Results of the current study suggest it is prudent to use an extended withdrawal time when administering local anesthetics in combination with epinephrine to performance horses. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: A 3D printed self-locking device made of polydioxanone (PDO) was developed to facilitate a standardized ligation technique. The subcutaneous tissue reaction to the device was evaluated after implantation in ten horses of mixed age, sex and breed and compared to loops of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). In two of the horses, the implants were removed before closing the skin. The appearance of the implants and surrounding tissue was followed over time using ultrasonography. Implants were removed after 10 and 27 (± 1) days for histologic examination. Results: On macroscopic inspection at day 10, the PDO-device was fragmented and the surrounding tissue was oedematous. On ultrasonographic examination, the device was seen as a hyperechoic structure with strong acoustic shadowing that could be detected 4 months post-implantation, but not at 7 months. Histology revealed a transient granulomatous inflammation, i.e., a foreign body reaction, which surrounded both PDO and PLGA implants. The type and intensity of the inflammation varied between individuals and tissue category. Conclusions: The 3D printed PDO-device caused a transient inflammatory reaction in the subcutaneous tissue and complete resorption occurred between 4 and 7 months. Considering the intended use as a ligation device the early fragmentation warrants further adjustments of both material and the 3D printing process before the device can be used in a clinical setting. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Equestrian eventing is a dangerous Olympic sport, with 16 rider and 69 horse fatalities at competition in the last 10 years. Despite this, there is limited research that aims to improve safety within the sport. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for horse falls, which are the leading cause of rider fatality within the sport. Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Competition data between January 2005 and December 2015 were analysed. Descriptive statistics followed by univariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for inclusion in a multivariable logistic regression model were conducted. Models were constructed stepwise using a bidirectional process and assessed using the Akaike information criterion. A total of 749 534 cross-country starts were analysed for association with the risk of horse falls. Results: Sixteen risk factors were identified including: higher event levels, higher dressage penalties and higher number of days since horses' last start. For example, horse and rider combinations competing at BE100 (OR 1.64, confidence interval (CI) 1.37–1.96, p < 0.001), novice (OR 3.58, CI 3.03–4.24, p < 0.001), intermediate (OR 8.00, CI 6.54–9.78, p < 0.001), advanced (OR 12.49, CI 9.42–16.57, p < 0.001) and international (OR 4.63, CI 3.50–6.12, p < 0.001) all had a higher risk of having a horse fall in comparison to combinations competing at BE90 level. Furthermore, for every additional 10 dressage penalties awarded to a horse and rider combination, there was a higher risk of a horse fall (OR 1.20, CI 1.12–1.28, p < 0.001). Main limitations: The study is not geographically comprehensive (UK only) and does not include any information on training activity of horses and riders. Conclusions: This is the largest-scale study ever conducted on horse falls during eventing competition. Study results can be used by sport governing bodies to inform policy which has the potential to reduce the risk of injury and fatality to sport participants. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To test the influence of increasing injectate volumes on the regional effects of xylazine and morphine epidural analgesia, with the hypothesis that increasing volume produces more cranial spread of analgesia as determined by thermal threshold (TT) testing. ANIMALS 6 university-owned research/teaching horses (2 mares, 4 geldings) deemed healthy on physical examination and basic lameness evaluation, aged 6–19 years and weighing 420–560 kg, were used in this prospective, randomized, blinded, cross-over experimental study. METHODS After routine placement of a caudal epidural catheter, all animals were subsequently instrumented with a TT testing system at the withers (Location A), the cranial (Location B), and caudal (Location C) abdominal area, over the tuber coxae (Location D), and the hind limb dorsal pasterns (Location E). All horses underwent five testing cycles with 0.2 mg/kg morphine and 0.2 mg/kg xylazine diluted to 20, 35, 50, 75, and 100 mL. TT testing was performed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours by blinded investigators. RESULTS With increased epidural volume, significantly greater cranial spread of analgesic effect was noted. All epidural volumes caused significant changes in TT testing at location E but only the largest volume resulted in a significant TT testing change at location A. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Volume influences the regional effects of caudal epidural analgesia in horses but might affect analgesic reliability. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: Keeping horses in single stalls can lead to the development of abnormal and stereotypic behaviors (ASB). Opportunities for social interactions and stall architecture can influence behavior. The current study aimed to identify how three different stall architectures influenced time-budget and physiological parameters in horses. Stall types included: (1) 3.2 × 3.7 m with tactile contact between horses (B1); (2) 2.6 × 3.5 m with visual contact between horses and outside view (B2); (3) 2.3 × 3.4 m with visual contact and outside view (B3). Ten horses from B1 and B3, and nine from B2 were randomly selected, filmed for 24 hours and the video was analyzed with continuous behavioral sampling. Nine horses from B1, 8 from B2 and 7 from B3 were randomly selected for blood sampling used to determine cortisol levels, cortisol circadian rhythm (CCR), white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. The effects of different stall architectures were analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test. B1 had higher social interaction time (2.77% of the time-budget) (P = .020), with no other differences. Time spent eating represented a low proportion of horses’ time-budget (14.31%) and all horses demonstrated ASB behaviors (21.10% of the time-budget). Twenty-five percent of the horses presented low WBC, 38% of the horses had high cortisol levels, and 29% of the horses had an altered CCR. Those alterations along with high prevalence of ASB indicate that horses were in a state of chronic stress. The stalls’ architecture did not affect the presence of abnormal behaviors or indicators of stress. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The use of non-conventional seed flour is of interest in obtaining healthy breakfast cereals. The research aimed to study the physico-functional, bioactive, microstructure, and thermal characteristics of breakfast cereals using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and differential scanning calorimeter. The increase in feed moisture content (16 %) enhanced the bulk density (5.24 g/mL), water absorption index (7.76 g/g), total phenolic content (9.03 mg GAE/g), and antioxidant activity (30.36 %) having desirable expansion rate (2.84 mm), water solubility index (48 %), and color attributes. The microstructure showed dense inner structures with closed air cells in extruded flours. Extrusion treatment rearranged the crystalline structure from A-type to V-type by disrupting the granular structure of starch, reducing its crystallinity, and promoting the formation of an amylose–lipid complex network. Increasing conditioning moisture enhanced the degree of gelatinization (%), peak gelatinization temperature (Tp), and starch crystallinity (%) and reduced the gelatinization enthalpy (ΔHG) and gelatinization temperature ranges. The results reported in this study will help industries to develop innovative and novel food products containing functional ingredients. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: In the last few decades, the demand for fruits and vegetables and mixed beverages such as juices and smoothies increased rapidly, which made it one of the highest-growing segments of the food industry. The horse gram is an underutilized crop having desired nutrient and bioactive compounds essential for growth and normal body functioning. In view of the above facts, the present study aimed to develop a milk-based smoothie by incorporating horse gram extract in addition to commonly used ingredients such as sugar, dahi, stabilizer, fruits, and vegetables. In this study, three levels of horse gram extract (HGE-5, 10, and 15%) were blended with cow milk, and other ingredients (sugar, dahi, pectin, banana, carrot juice extract) were kept constant. The 0% level of HGE was taken as a control to compare the nutritional and functional characteristics of the optimized product. The 10% HGE incorporated product was found best based on sensory and physico-chemical properties. The optimized product was found with 3.03±0.08% fat, 3.38±0.07% protein, 16.17±0.10% carbohydrate, 0.81±0.05% ash, 843.33±3.08 cp viscosity, 3.48±0.05 g/10 g whey syneresis, 12.12±0.67 g/20 g sedimentation, and 31.11 ± 4.17% 2,2-dipenylpicrylhydrazyl inhibition activity. The optimized smoothie had nine days shelf life after packing in polypropylene cups when stored under refrigerated conditions. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The quantity of eggs produced in an annual reproductive cycle of some commercially important shellfish is vital in a hatchery operation or managing the wild populations. The horse clam Tresus keenae (Kuroda & Habe, 1950) is one of the aquaculture candidate bivalve species occurring on the subtidal soft bottom of the coastal Northwest Pacific ocean, while their reproductive effort is yet to be determined. Unlike fishes, assessing the reproductive effort of a marine bivalve is challenging since most species do not have a separable gonad except scallops, as ovaries or testis are inseparable from the visceral mass. Therefore, we developed an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the quantity of the egg produced in an annual reproductive cycle. The rabbit anti-egg protein IgG developed in this study was sensitive enough to detect as little as 0.3 μg/ml of the egg protein in indirect ELISA. The horse clam produced as much as 41.1% of the total body weight as eggs during spawning in October, equivalent to 378.2 million mature eggs. Histology revealed that T. keenae has a short resting period in January and February and a long period of gonial mitosis from March to August. The annual reproductive cycle and reproductive capacity of T. keenae estimated in this study provide crucial information in the successful hatchery operation to develop the horse clam aquaculture and manage the wild population for sustainable exploitation. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is the functional region of the viral Spike protein (S), which is involved in cell attachment to target cells. The virus has accumulated progressively mutations in its genome, particularly in the RBD region, many of them associated with immune evasion of the host neutralizing antibodies. Some of the viral lineages derived from this evolution have been classified as Variant of Interest (VOI) or Concern (VOC). The neutralizing capacity of a F(ab′)2 preparation from sera of horses immunized with viral RBD was evaluated by lytic plaque reduction assay against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. A F(ab′)2 preparation of a hyperimmune serum after nine immunizations with RBD exhibited a high titer of neutralizing antibodies against the ancestral-like strain (1/18,528). A reduction in the titer of the F(ab’)2 preparation was observed against the different variants tested compared to the neutralizing activity against the ancestral-like strain. The highest reduction in the neutralization titer was observed for the Omicron VOC (4.7-fold), followed by the Mu VOI (2.6), Delta VOC (1.8-fold), and Gamma VOC (1.5). Even if a progressive reduction in the neutralizing antibodies titer against the different variants evaluated was observed, the serum still exhibited a neutralizing titer against the Mu VOI and the Omicron VOC (1/7113 and 1/3918, respectively), the evaluated strains most resistant to neutralization. Therefore, the preparation retained neutralizing activity against all the strains tested. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Peatlands are globally significant carbon sinks, but when disturbed, have the potential to release carbon back to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. Feral horse populations in the Australian Alps degrade Sphagnum peatlands, which are highly sensitive to disturbance. However, the link between this degradation and peatland carbon cycling is not understood. Here, we compared the autumn daytime carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes of 12 alpine and subalpine Sphagnum peatlands in Kosciuszko National Park, Australia. The presence of feral horses at these sites was correlated with higher carbon loss: sites with horses were losing carbon to the atmosphere (4.83 and 8.18 g CO2-e m−2 d−1 in areas of Sphagnum moss and bare soil, respectively), whereas sites without horses were removing carbon from the atmosphere (−6.39 g CO2-e m−2 d−1). Sites with feral horses also had higher soil bulk density, temperature, and electrical conductivity (EC), and higher water pH, EC, and turbidity, than sites without horses. Our findings suggest that excluding feral horses from peatland areas could reduce rates of carbon loss to the atmosphere, in addition to improving overall site condition, peat soil condition, and water quality. We discuss potential management applications, further research, and restoration opportunities arising from these results. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Field veterinarians and researchers studying wild species, such as the southern white rhinoceros, often work in remote areas with limited access to standard laboratory equipment, hindering the ability to measure serum analytes. Objectives: The first objective was to produce an inexpensive, manually operated centrifuge that could accept standard laboratory tubes by modifying a consumer-grade salad spinner with low-cost materials. The second objective was to compare biochemistry analysis results obtained from equine and southern white rhinoceros serum separated by traditional laboratory and manual salad spinner centrifugation. Methods: We optimized the design and serum separation protocol using non-anticoagulated equine blood. Equine and rhinoceros serum samples were separated by manual salad spinner or traditional laboratory centrifugation. Measured analytes included sodium, potassium, chloride, urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorous, total calcium, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatinine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, bicarbonate, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and triglycerides. Results obtained from serum separated by each centrifugation technique were compared by Deming regression and Bland–Altman analyses. Results: A tube adaptor insert modeled after a swing angle rotor and a two-step salad spinner centrifugation yielded serum comparable to traditional laboratory centrifugation. For the majority of analytes, no proportional or constant biases were detected between centrifugation methods. A positive proportional bias in the measurement of ALP in serum separated by manual centrifugation was detected in both equine and rhinoceros samples. Conclusions: Manual centrifugation with a modified salad spinner yields diagnostic quality serum suitable for the measurement of most standard biochemistry analytes. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Traumatic wounds account for a large portion of the caseload of an equine practitioner. Any mechanism that accelerates the speed of wound healing would have a significant impact in horses’ world. Polaprezinc (PZ) is a complex of L-carnosine and zinc, it has been proven to be very effective for the repairing process of the mucosa in many human’s conditions such as gastric ulcers, ulcerative colitis and hemorrhoids. We conducted a randomized prospective study with the aim to evaluate the wound healing activity of Polaprezinc (PZ) in equine patients, applying the molecule topically on the wounds. Seventeen horses suffering from traumatized wounds were included in this study. Horses were randomly divided in two groups: horses treated with PZ, 11 animals, and horses treated with povidone iodine gel, 6 animals. The majority of wounds included in the study were located on limbs. Wounds were assessed on the basis of healing time, that was defined as time interval from first dressing to patient’s discharge. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to compare the results of both groups. Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate whether the onset of exuberant granulation tissue could have statistical significance between the two groups. The mean healing time was consistently reduced in treated horses leading to a faster resumption of the animal’s activity; the reduced number of cases led to a low significance of EGT onset in treated group, while clinically a predisposition was noted among treated cases. The local treatment with PZ on skin wounds proved to be effective and safe and it represents an excellent alternative to the methods traditionally used for the dressing of lesions undergoing second intention repair.

ABSTRACT: Being a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, doxorubicin is indispensable for clinical treatment. Unexpectedly, its cardiotoxic side effects have proven to be a formidable obstacle. Numerous studies are currently devoted to elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Nrf2 has always played a crucial role in oxidative stress, but numerous studies have demonstrated that it also plays a vital part in pathological mechanisms like cell death and inflammation. Numerous studies on the pathological mechanisms associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity demonstrate this. Several clinical drugs, natural and synthetic compounds, as well as small molecule RNAs have been demonstrated to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by activating Nrf2. Consequently, this study emphasizes the introduction of Nrf2, discusses the role of Nrf2 in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and concludes with a summary of the therapeutic modalities targeting Nrf2 to ameliorate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, highlighting the potential value of Nrf2 in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

ABSTRACT: Human anisakidosis is a parasitic infection caused by the ingestion of nematode larvae of the Anisakidae family contained in various organs of fish and cephalopods consumed raw or undercooked. The aim of this work was to detect and identify morphologically and genetically (PCR and sequencing) the nematode larvae present in both flesh and abdominal cavity of horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) which are widely consumed by the population of Marrakesh. For this purpose, 299 fish were purchased at the wholesale market in refrigerated conditions. They were originated from seven different landing ports along the Atlantic coast (Agadir, Dakhla, El Jadida, Essaouira, Mohammedia, Safi and Sidi Ifni). The fishes were analyzed from November 2017 to December 2019, and 4815 larvae were detected out of 294 positive horse mackerel. This resulted in a prevalence of 98.33% and a mean intensity of 16.38 larvae per fish. Horse mackerel from Mohammedia, El Jadida, Safi, Essaouira, Agadir and Sidi Ifni were more infested than those from Dakhla with a mean intensity of 25.29, 21.33, 18.88, 16.15, 15.90 and 13.86 larvae per fish, respectively, while that from Dakhla was the least infested with a mean intensity of 11.83. These results could be explained by the availability of primary intermediate hosts of Anisakis spp., such as crustaceans (shrimps), which are more abundant in the northern Moroccan Atlantic coast. Furthermore, we have recorded a higher infection in fish during warm seasons (spring and summer) than during cold ones. We also have noticed that as the distance from the fishing area increased, the larvae had more time to migrate from the abdominal cavity to the muscles. All detected larvae were identified morphologically as Anisakis type I and genetically as Anisakis simplex sensu stricto. Statistical analysis showed that the intensity of infection by Anisakis L3 larvae was positively correlated with the weight of horse mackerel and that origin had no impact on fish parasitism. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Pastures are used for grazing and the production of conserved roughage in horses. Yet, the nutritional profile of the forage varies from spring to late summer, affecting equine nutrient supply and health. In addition, environmental factors may also favor plant contaminants such as mycotoxins. This study aimed to determine the nutritional profile and contaminant load of selected horse pastures from early spring till late summer. The nutrient composition (main macronutrients, macro elements and trace elements), as well as mycotoxins, metabolites, pesticides, and plant-derived compounds of seven horse pastures were analyzed. Each pasture was sampled three times and the samples were categorized according to the status of the pasture plants: ear emergence, early- till full bloom, and drought-damaged vegetation. Drought-damaged pastures demonstrated a rise in the acid to neutral detergent fiber ratio, calcium, iron, and magnesium but lower potassium contents. Mycotoxins and other contaminants were found in the pastures including 64 fungal compounds (ergot alkaloids (13) and metabolites from Fusarium (21), Aspergillus (2), Penicillium (8), Alternaria (8) and other fungal species (12), one bacterial metabolite (cereulide), twelve plant metabolites (including eight phytoestrogens and three cyanogenic glycosides (linamarin, lotaustralin and prunasin)), 11 nonspecific metabolites and six pesticides. Fusarium metabolites showed the highest concentrations among the fungal metabolites and drought-induced stress increased the contamination levels (range: 123-3873 µg/kg DM). In conclusion, there was a dominant effect of the developmental stages of the plants, botanical composition of the pastures and weather conditions on the nutritional composition and presence of contaminants on pastures. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by the destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas by cytotoxic T-cells. To date, there are no drugs that can prevent the development of T1D. Insulin replacement therapy is the standard care for patients with T1D. This treatment is life-saving, but is expensive, can lead to acute and long-term complications, and results in reduced overall life expectancy. This has stimulated the research and development of alternative treatments for T1D. In this review, we consider potential therapies for T1D using cellular regenerative medicine approaches with a focus on CRISPR/Cas-engineered cellular products. However, CRISPR/Cas as a genome editing tool has several drawbacks that should be considered for safe and efficient cell engineering. In addition, cellular engineering approaches themselves pose a hidden threat. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss novel strategies for the treatment of T1D using genome editing technology. A well-designed approach to β-cell derivation using CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing technology will significantly reduce the risk of incorrectly engineered cell products that could behave as a “Trojan horse”. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 is increased in renal tissue in human kidney disease, but its role as a biomarker for kidney disease has not been fully evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum MMP-9 (sMMP-9) and urinary MMP-9 (uMMP-9) concentrations in dehydrated horses. Dehydrated horses were prospectively included. Blood and urinary samples were taken at admission, and after 12, 24, and 48 h (t0, t12, t24, t48), an anti-equine MMP-9 sandwich ELISA was used. Four healthy horses served as the controls. Serum creatinine, urea, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), urine-specific gravity, urinary protein concentration, fractional sodium excretion, and urinary gamma–glutamyl transferase/creatinine ratio (uGGT/Cr) were measured. Statistical analysis included a repeated measures ANOVA and mixed linear regression model. Overall, 40 dehydrated horses were included (mild dehydration 13/40, moderate 16/40, severe 11/40). Acute kidney injury was found in 1/40 horses; 7/40 horses showed elevated serum creatinine, 11/40 horses elevated serum SDMA, and 5/28 elevated uGGT/Cr at presentation. In dehydrated horses, sMMP-9 concentrations were significantly higher on t0 (median: 589 ng/mL, range: 172–3597 ng/mL) compared to t12 (340 ng/mL, 132–1213 ng/mL), t24 (308 ng/mL, 162–1048 ng/mL), and t48 (258 ng/mL, 130–744 ng/mL). In healthy horses, sMMP-9 (239 ng/mL, 142–508 ng/mL) showed no differences over time or compared to patients. uMMP-9 and uMMP-9/creatinine did not differ over time or to the controls. No differences were found between dehydration groups. Urinary casts (p = 0.001; estimate = 135) and uGGT/Cr (p = 0.03; estimate = 6.5) correlated with sMMP-9. Serum urea was associated with uMMP-9/Cr (p = 0.01, estimate 0.9). In conclusion, sMMP-9 was elevated at arrival in dehydrated patients compared to later measurements. Correlations to uGGT/Cr and urinary casts need further evaluation. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The Connemara pony (CP) is an Irish breed that has experienced varied selection by breeders over the last fifty years, with objectives ranging from the traditional hardy pony to an agile athlete. We compared these ponies with well-studied Warmblood (WB) horses, which are also selectively bred for athletic performance but with a much larger census population. Using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and whole-genome sequencing data from 116 WB (94 UK WB and 22 European WB) and 36 CP (33 UK CP and 3 US CP), we studied the genomic diversity, inbreeding and population structure of these breeds. Results: The k-means clustering approach divided both the CP and WB populations into four genetic groups, among which the CP genetic group 1 (C1) associated with non-registered CP, C4 with US CP, WB genetic group 1 (W1) with Holsteiners, and W3 with Anglo European and British WB. Maximum and mean linkage disequilibrium (LD) varied significantly between the two breeds (mean from 0.077 to 0.130 for CP and from 0.016 to 0.370 for WB), but the rate of LD decay was generally slower in CP than WB. The LD block size distribution peaked at 225 kb for all genetic groups, with most of the LD blocks not exceeding 1 Mb. The top 0.5% harmonic mean pairwise fixation index (FST) values identified ontology terms related to cancer risk when the four CP genetic groups were compared. The four CP genetic groups were less inbred than the WB genetic groups, but C2, C3 and C4 had a lower proportion of shorter runs of homozygosity (ROH) (74 to 76% < 4 Mb) than the four WB genetic groups (80 to 85% < 4 Mb), indicating more recent inbreeding. The CP and WB genetic groups had a similar ratio of effective number of breeders (Neb) to effective population size (Ne). Conclusions: Distinct genetic groups of individuals were revealed within each breed, and in WB these genetic groups reflected population substructure better than studbook or country of origin. Ontology terms associated with immune and inflammatory responses were identified from the signatures of selection between CP genetic groups, and while CP were less inbred than WB, the evidence pointed to a greater degree of recent inbreeding. The ratio of Neb to Ne was similar in CP and WB, indicating the influence of popular sires is similar in CP and WB. © 2023, ’Institut National de Recherche en Agriculture, Alimentation et Environnement (INRAE).

ABSTRACT: Background: Subchondral lucencies (SCLs) in the distal aspect of the medial femoral condyle (MFC) of young Thoroughbred horses are a source of controversy on presale radiographs. There is limited scientific evidence regarding the risk of progression and impact on future racing performance. Objectives: To (1) identify the prevalence of MFC SCLs on sales repository radiographs in yearling and 2-year-old Thoroughbreds; (2) identify any association between grade of MFC SCL and future racing performance and (3) monitor changes in MFC SCL grades between yearling and 2-year-old sales. Study design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Radiographs were obtained with consignor permission from a 2016 yearling sale and five 2017 2-year-old sales. Stifle radiographs were evaluated and MFC SCLs graded on a scale of 0–3. Axial MFC lucencies were recorded separately. Maximum MFC grades per horse were analysed for associations with racing performance outcomes, adjusted for sex, to the end of the horses' 4-year-old racing year. Analysis was via logistic, negative binomial or linear regression as appropriate, with the threshold for significance set at α = 0.05. Results: Radiographs from 2508 yearlings (5016 stifles) and 436 2-year-olds (872 stifles) were included in the study. MFC SCLs of grades 1–3 were observed in 242 (9.65%) yearlings and 49 (11.2%) 2-year-olds. Bilateral MFC SCLs of grades 1–3 were observed in 54 (2.2%) yearlings and 12 (2.8%) 2-year-olds. Grade 1 MFC SCLs in yearlings either remained unchanged (14/31), progressed to a grade 2 (6/31) or resolved (11/31) by the 2-year-old sale. Grade 2 MFC SCLs in yearlings remained unchanged (6/10), progressed to a grade 3 (2/10) or improved to a grade 1 (2/10). Yearlings with a grade 3 MFC SCL had a 78% probability of starting a race (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.2–89.6%), compared with an 84% probability of racing for grade 0 yearlings (95% CI 82.7–85.8%). Six of the seven yearlings with axial MFC lucencies raced. Main limitations: This study may underestimate the prevalence of severe lesions in the general yearling population of U.S. Thoroughbreds. However, the convenience sample used is representative of the population of interest at sales. The study design could not address exclusions prior to sale. Conclusions: Grade 1 MFC SCLs are the most common type seen in yearling and 2-year-old sales horses. The majority of yearling grade 1 MFC SCLs resolved or remained static by 2-year-old sales. It was also possible for grade 2 and 3 MFC SCLs to improve one grade between sales. Fewer sales yearlings with a grade 3 MFC SCL raced, but in those that did race there was no evidence of worse performance compared to unaffected peers. Axial MFC lucencies did not affect racing performance. © 2023 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe the successful restoration of superior eyelid function in a horse following traumatic avulsion using an advancement flap blepharoplasty and subdermal hyaluronic acid filler. Animal Studied: A 21-year-old American Paint Horse stallion who was attacked by a fellow stallion resulting in numerous traumatic injuries including avulsion of approximately 75% of the left superior eyelid. Procedures: With standing sedation and locoregional anesthesia, the superior eyelid wound was debrided and an advancement flap blepharoplasty (H-plasty) and temporary tarsorrhaphy were performed. Routine healing of the surgical site occurred over the subsequent weeks, though lagophthalmos persisted. At 2 and 4 weeks post-operatively, 2.4% cross-linked hyaluronic acid was injected subdermally into the superior eyelid to attempt to improve corneal coverage. At 8 weeks post-operatively, a complete blink was restored and the cosmetic outcome was good. Conclusions: Injection of subdermal hyaluronic acid filler following eyelid injuries or blepharoplastic procedures that result in lagophthalmos can improve corneal coverage by the eyelids and allow for maintenance of a comfortable and visual eye. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: After parturition, a rapid transition occurs from the intrauterine to the extrauterine milieu, exposing neonates to physiological circumstances characterized by oxidative conditions that instigate the generation of reactive oxygen species. These free radicals play pivotal roles in physiological processes; however, an imbalance between their production and the removal of antioxidants can result in severe cellular damage. The main objective of this study was to compare the oxidative and antioxidant profiles in mule and horse neonates immediately post-parturition, as well as at subsequent time points (1, 6, 12, and 24 h, 7 and 30 days) during their extrauterine existence. The parameters assessed included the systemic concentrations of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) and carbonyl groups; the activities of the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx); and the levels of the total, indirect, and direct bilirubin. Our results showed no interaction effect between the neonatal groups and the assessed time points for the variables under investigation. Notably, the concentrations of TBARS, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, and bilirubin were consistently lower in the mules, whereas the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity exhibited higher levels in this group. The bilirubin levels were notably reduced in the mule neonates. The TBARS demonstrated a progressive decrease over the observation period in both groups, while the GPx activity remained relatively stable from birth to 7 days, with a substantial increase evident at the 30-day mark. Protein oxidation was not affected by the group and time, while for the SOD values, all times were statistically similar, except for the lower activity at T1h. Consequently, our findings lead us to the conclusion that neonatal mules and horses manifest distinct patterns of oxidative activity and antioxidant capacity during the initial month of their extrauterine existence, potentially indicative of different adaptation mechanisms to the extrauterine environment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses of the Mangalarga Marchador breed have traditionally been selected for their morphology and gait pattern, being for comfortable to ride over long periods of time and during ranch work. Meanwhile, the athletic side of the breed has been much overlooked, especially regarding the endurance and working equitation competitions. In this study, 31 Mangalarga Marchador horses were evaluated during the national competition Caminhos do Marchador. The referred competition was carried out in three stages, with the first being an endurance stage, the second stage a working equitation stage, and the third and last stage was a gait evaluation, where the gait of the horses were assessed subjectively by an official jury. Twenty-five morphometric measurements and indexes of these animals were taken after the competition and were then statistically analyzed. A correlation between gender and athletic performance was found, with geldings having the best results, and females having the worst results. The type of gait also influenced the final ratings, with horses presenting batida gait having better placements. Smaller horses had better results than tall horses, while there was no age interference in the final ratings. © 2024 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido

ABSTRACT: Numerous biting and nuisance insects are a noted cause of discomfort and stress to horses. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids have been used for many years in numerous formulations for the control of insect pests in animals, humans and environment. There are, however, few studies reporting their field efficacy in horses. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the repellent activity of a spray formulation based on prallethrin and permethrin synergized with piperonyl butoxide (BRONCO® Equine Fly Spray, Farnam Companies, Inc., USA) against annoying and harmful insects for horses in field conditions. Nine horses of mixed breed were divided into 2 groups (treatment and control). Pre-treatment insect counts were compared to daily counts for 4 days post-treatment (pt). One minute after the administration of the product (day 0), all the horses were negative for the presence of insects. All counts up to the 6-h pt check remained negative for Hippobosca equina, tabanid flies and Simulium spp., showing 100% efficacy. This remained above 90% throughout the study. For the H. equina, the repellent efficacy remained > 99.7% for all 4 days pt, for tabanid flies > 93.3% and for Simulium spp. > 97.4%. The efficacy against Musca spp. decreased from 82.2% at day 0 to 62.2% at day 3. Treatment was well-tolerated. In conclusion, despite the low number of tested horses, Bronco® has demonstrated high insecticide and repellent efficacy and a good persistence, maintained for up to 4 days post-treatment, against the most common species of insects harmful for horses. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this case report is to describe and document a rare anatomical variation of a moderator band located in right ventricle of a stallion referred for cryptorchid castration. During routine pre-anesthetic echocardiography, a thick moderator band was detected crossing the right ventricle. No other cardiovascular abnormalities were identified. Anesthesia and recovery occurred uneventfully. This variation is important not only for anatomy but also for the evaluation of normal heart both during ultrasound and electrocardiographic examination. © 2023, Trakia University.

ABSTRACT: The castration of stallions is traditionally performed after puberty, at around the age of 2 years old. No studies have focused on the effects of early castration on osteoarticular metabolism. Thus, we aimed to compare early castration (3 days after birth) with traditional castration (18 months of age) in horses. Testosterone and estradiol levels were monitored from birth to 33 months in both groups. We quantified the levels of biomarkers of cartilage and bone anabolism (CPII and N-MID) and catabolism (CTX-I and CTX-II), as well as of osteoarthritis (HA and COMP) and inflammation (IL-6 and PGE2). We observed a lack of parallelism between testosterone and estradiol synthesis after birth and during puberty in both groups. The extra-gonadal synthesis of steroids was observed around the 28-month mark, regardless of the castration age. We found the expression of estrogen receptor (ESR1) in cartilage and bone, whereas androgen receptor (AR) expression appeared to be restricted to bone. Nevertheless, with respect to osteoarticular metabolism, steroid hormone deprivation resulting from early castration had no discernable impact on the levels of biomarkers related to bone and cartilage metabolism, nor on those associated with OA and inflammation. Consequently, our research demonstrated that early castration does not disrupt bone and cartilage homeostasis. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Reproduction in young females can show a particularly sensitive response to environmental challenges, although empirical support from individual-based long-term studies is scarce. Based on a 20-year data set from a free-roaming Przewalski’s horse population (Equus ferus przewalskii), we studied effects of large-herbivore density (horses + cattle) and weather conditions experienced during different life stages on females’ annual birth rates. Foaling probability was very low in 2-year-olds, reaching maximum values in 5 to 10-year-olds, followed by a decrease in older females indicating reproductive senescence. Mother’s previous reproductive investment affected her current reproduction; young and old mothers (as opposed to middle-aged ones), which had nursed a foal for at least 60 days during the previous year, reproduced with a lower probability. Foaling probability and body condition of young females were lower when large-herbivore density was high. Reproduction was also influenced by interactive weather effects during different life stages. Low late-summer precipitation during the females’ year of birth was associated with a pronounced decrease in foaling probability in response to harsh late-winter temperatures prior to the mating season. In turn, increased amounts of late-summer rain during this early age together with more late-summer rain during the females’ current pregnancy led to an increased reproductive probability in 2–3-year-olds. These results were corroborated by the ameliorating effects of late-summer rain on body condition in such females. In conclusion, our findings highlight the interactive importance of weather conditions experienced during early life, and of density and weather during current pregnancy on foaling probability, particularly in young females. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a hardy, low-input oilseed crop that provides a rich source of the n-3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA). The primary purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of dietary camelina oil (CAM) consumption on various health parameters, as compared to horses fed canola oil (OLA) or flax oil (FLX). Secondly, to determine how dietary CAM, FLX, and OLA alter circulating plasma total lipids across time. Thirty horses, from three separate herds, were used for this study [14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg calculated BW (mean ± SD)]. After a 4-week gradual acclimation period using sunflower oil mixed with soaked hay cubes, horses were balanced by location, age, sex, weight, and breed and randomly allocated to one of three treatment oils (CAM, OLA, or FLX) at an inclusion of 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day. Horses had ad libitum access to hay and/or pasture for the duration of the study. Body condition score (BCS), BW, oil intake, complete blood counts, plasma biochemical profiles, and plasma total lipids were measured on weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 throughout the 16-week treatment period. BW, BCS, and oil intake were analyzed using an ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS Studio. Complete blood counts and biochemical profiles were analyzed using an ANCOVA, and fatty acids were analyzed using an ANOVA in PROC MIXED in SAS Studio. No differences were observed among treatment groups for BW, BCS, oil intake, complete blood counts, and biochemical parameters. Individual fatty acids that differed among treatments and/or across time were largely reflective of the different FA profiles of the oils provided. Most notably, plasma ALA was greater for FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.01). Linoleic acid did not differ among treatments or over time (P > 0.05). The n-6:n-3 ratio decreased over time for both CAM and FLX, and ratios were lower for FLX than OLA at week 16, but not different from CAM (P = 0.02). These results suggest that dietary CAM had no adverse effects on health parameters and that daily supplementation of CAM and FLX at 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day induces positive changes (a decrease) in the n-6:n-3 status of the horse. Consequently, CAM may be considered as an alternative oil to FLX in equine diets. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Equine asthma is an airway disease that affects a large number of horses annually leading to considerable economic losses in the horse industry. Despite advances in research in this area, there is still a lack of information on its etiology and molecular characterization in pasture associated asthma. The objective of the current study was to characterize the inflammatory disease of lower airways in horses maintained on pasture through cytologic and immunologic profile during the summer in a tropical environment by analysis of the gene expression of Th1 cytokines (IFN- λ, IL-8), Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in healthy and asthma horses on pasture. A group 39 of clinically healthy horses maintained on native pasture and supplemented with concentrate was evaluated by BAL analyzed for differential cellular count and assigned into a control and an asthma group. The gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was analyzed in the BAL by reverse time PCR (RT-PCR) (IL-1α (alpha), IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, TNF-α alpha and IFN-λ), using β-actin as housekeeping gene. Higher gene expression of IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IFN-λ in the BAL of asthma horses was found. Current results indicate an increase in Th2, characterizing an allergic inflammatory reaction due to the significant increase in IL-5 in asthmatic horses (10.3 ± 1.13), when compared to the values ​​obtained in normal horses (3.27 ± 0.46). The only down regulated cytokine in the asthma group was TNF-α, suggesting a chronic antigenic reaction. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: There is a paucity of literature on the dying and grief process of people and their companion animals, and even less on the therapy animals who partner with practitioners in animal-assisted therapies (AATs). Given the intimate and deeply meaningful relationships both practitioners and their clients form with the therapy animals they work with, this deserves more in-depth examination. This is true for the human clients and therapists, as well as for the animals themselves. In the practice of equine-assisted therapy (EAT) the horse is not a tool or a metaphor, but rather a sentient being with a subjective self and partner to the therapists they work with. © CAB International 2024.

ABSTRACT: In horses, the prevalence of obesity is high and associated with serious metabolic pathologies. Being a broodmare has been identified as a risk factor for obesity. In other species, maternal obesity is known to affect the development of the offspring. This article is a follow-up study of previous work showing that Obese mares (O, n = 10, body condition score > 4.25 at insemination) were more insulin resistant and presented increased systemic inflammation during pregnancy compared to Normal mares (N, n = 14, body condition score < 4 at insemination). Foals born to O mares were more insulin-resistant, presented increased systemic inflammation, and were more affected by osteoarticular lesions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of maternal obesity on placental structure and function, as well as the fatty acid profile in the plasma of mares and foals, colostrum, and milk until 90 days of lactation, which, to our knowledge, has been poorly studied in the horse. Mares from both groups were fed the same diet during pregnancy and lactation. During lactation, mares were housed in pasture. A strong heat wave, followed by a drought, occurred during their 2nd and 3rd months of lactation (summer of 2016 in the Limousin region, France). In the present article, term placental morphometry, structure (stereology), and gene expression (RT-qPCR, genes involved in nutrient transport, growth, and development, as well as vascularization) were studied. Plasma of mares and their foals, as well as colostrum and milk, were sampled at birth, 30 days, and 90 days of lactation. The fatty acid composition of these samples was measured using gas chromatography. No differences between the N and O groups were observed for term placental morphometry, structure, or gene expression. No difference in plasma fatty acid composition was observed between groups in mares. The plasma fatty acid profile of O foals was more pro-inflammatory and indicated an altered placental lipid metabolism between birth and 90 days of age. These results are in line with the increased systemic inflammation and altered glucose metabolism observed until 18 months of age in this group. The colostrum fatty acid profile of O mares was more pro-inflammatory and indicated an increased transfer and/or desaturation of long-chain fatty acids. Moreover, O foals received a colostrum poorer in medium-chain saturated fatty acid, a source of immediate energy for the newborn that can also play a role in immunity and gut microbiota development. Differences in milk fatty acid composition indicated a decreased ability to adapt to heat stress in O mares, which could have further affected the metabolic development of their foals. In conclusion, maternal obesity affected the fatty acid composition of milk, thus also influencing the foal’s plasma fatty acid composition and likely participating in the developmental programming observed in growing foals. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The improper disposal of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is hazardous to the environment. To rectify the inappropriate disposal of PVC, this study proposes a sustainable method to valorize hydrogen chloride (HCl) (from the thermolysis of PVC) in bioethanol (BE) production. Prior to saccharification, lignocellulosic biomass (horse hay) was treated with HCl. The optimized parameters for acid treatment were determined from a series of saccharification tests. In detail, the sugar recovery yield was 75 % after 2 % HCl, 120 °C, and 2 h treatment of horse hay. In addition, this study suggests that a nitrogen source is required during fermentation to enhance BE productivity. To valorize the residual materials from the saccharification of horse hay and dechlorination of PVC, they were pyrolyzed. Co-pyrolysis of the residues was performed in a CO2 gas environment. The gas-phase reaction of CO2 and volatiles stemming from the two residues was observed, which directly led to the enhanced generation of carbon monoxide (CO). These observations are attributed to the simultaneous redox mechanisms of CO2 and volatiles. To accelerate the reaction rate of the redox mechanisms, catalytic co-pyrolysis of the residues over Co/SiO2 was performed, and such attempts were confirmed by the enhanced formation of H2 and CO. This study highlights that the hybridization of the thermochemical process of PVC in the production of BE could be a viable approach for waste valorization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Back mobility is a criterion of well-being in a horse. Veterinarians visually assess the mobility of a horse’s back during a locomotor examination. Quantifying it with on-board technology could be a major breakthrough to help them. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a method of quantifying the back mobility of horses from inertial measurement units (IMUs) compared to motion capture (MOCAP) as a gold standard. Reflective markers and IMUs were positioned on the withers, eighteenth thoracic vertebra, and pelvis of four sound horses. The horses performed a walk and trot in straight lines and performed a gallop in circles on a soft surface. The developed method, based on the three IMUs, consists of calculating the flexion/extension angle of the thoracolumbar region. The IMU method showed a mean bias of 0.8° (±1.5°) (mean (±SD)) and 0.8° (±1.4°), respectively, for the flexion and extension movements, all gaits combined, compared to the MOCAP method. The results of this study suggest that the developed method has a similar accuracy to that of MOCAP, opening up possibilities for easy measurements under field conditions. Future studies will need to examine the correlations between these biomechanical measures and clinicians’ visual assessment of back mobility defects. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: In domesticated animals, many important traits are complex and regulated by a large number of genes, genetic interactions, and environmental influences. The ability of Icelandic horses to perform the gait ‘pace’ is largely influenced by a single mutation in the DMRT3 gene, but genetic modifiers likely exist. The aim of this study was to identify novel genetic factors that influence pacing ability and quality of the gait through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and correlate new findings to previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) and mutations. Results: Three hundred and seventy-two Icelandic horses were genotyped with the 670 K+ Axiom Equine Genotyping Array, of which 362 had gait scores from breeding field tests. A GWAS revealed several SNPs on Equus caballus chromosomes (ECA) 4, 9, and 20 that were associated (p < 1.0 × 10–5) with the breeding field test score for pace. The two novel QTL on ECA4 and 9 were located within the RELN and STAU2 genes, respectively, which have previously been associated with locomotor behavior in mice. Haplotypes were identified and the most frequent one for each of these two QTL had a large favorable effect on pace score. The second most frequent haplotype for the RELN gene was positively correlated with scores for tölt, trot, gallop, and canter. Similarly, the second most frequent haplotype for the STAU2 gene had favorable effects on scores for trot and gallop. Different genotype ratios of the haplotypes in the RELN and STAU2 genes were also observed in groups of horses with different levels of pacing ability. Furthermore, interactions (p < 0.05) were detected for the QTL in the RELN and STAU2 genes with the DMRT3 gene. The novel QTL on ECA4, 9, and 20, along with the effects of the DMRT3 variant, were estimated to account jointly for 27.4% of the phenotypic variance of the gait pace. Conclusions: Our findings provide valuable information about the genetic architecture of pace beyond the contribution of the DMRT3 gene and indicate genetic interactions that contribute to the complexity of this trait. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying genetic factors and interactions. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: During an African horse sickness (AHS) outbreak, horses were able to exercise daily in a net-covered arena, yet the physiological responses to exercise in a netted arena was unknown. In a cross-over study design, eight horses performed a 39-minute aerobic exercise in conventional (CA) and vector-protected arenas (VPA). Horses were slower in some gaits and covered less distance in the VPA arena (P < .01). Cortisol release, hematology, and heart rate variability (HRV) were also examined. An interaction between the riding arena and time was observed in hematocrit (P = .0013), hemoglobin (P = .0012), and red blood cell count (P = .0027) and HRV variables, including mean beat-to-beat (RR) intervals (P < .0001), mean heart rate (P < .0001), sympathetic nervous system (SNS) index (P = .0038) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) index (P < .0001). Cortisol concentrations increased during exercise and 30 minutes postexercise in both arenas. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell count increased immediately postexercise in horses in VPA while remaining high from immediate post-exercise to 60 minutes postexercise in horses in CA. HRV decreased during exercise and was not different between horses in both arenas, but a higher RR interval and PNS index, corresponding to lower heart rate and SNS index, were detected during 30 to 60 minutes postexercise in horses in the VPA compared to the CA. Riding horses in different arenas impacted hematological and HRV variables. The greater RR intervals and PNS index, coinciding with the lower SNS index and heart rate, indicated parasympathetic dominance post-exercise in horses in VPA compared to CA. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Xinjiang is the largest cotton-producing region in China, but it faces a severe shortage of water resources. According to relevant studies, the cotton yield does not significantly decrease under appropriate limited water conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a water and fertilizer integrated control system to achieve water and fertilizer conservation in the process of cotton field cultivation. This paper designs a fuzzy neural network Proportional–Integral–Derivative controller based on the improved Wild Horse Optimizer to address the water and fertilizer integrated control system’s time-varying, lag, and non-linear characteristics. The controller precisely controls fertilizer electrical conductivity (EC) by optimizing parameters through an improved Wild Horse Optimizer for the initial weights from the normalization layer to the output layer, the initial center values of membership functions, and the initial base width of membership functions in the fuzzy neural network. The performance of the controller is validated through MATLAB simulation and experimental tests. The results indicate that, compared with conventional PID controllers and fuzzy PID controllers, this controller exhibits excellent control accuracy and robustness, effectively achieving precise fertilization. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Osteochondral fragment removal is commonly performed but there are little scientific data supporting this procedure in the absence of clinical signs. More information is needed to facilitate clinical decision-making regarding fragment removal of the metacarpo−/metatarsophalangeal joint. Objectives: To assess prevalence of cartilage injury in the equine metacarpo−/metatarsophalangeal joint and its association to fragment size, location, age and lameness. Study design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: Clinical records, including radiographs of 823 metacarpo−/metatarsophalangeal joints (640 horses) that underwent arthroscopic fragment removal, were reviewed. Fragment size, intra-articular fragment location and cartilage injury score were recorded. Presence of synovitis was retrospectively evaluated in 157 joints. Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests were used for group comparisons, and Dunn's post hoc test was applied for multiple comparisons. Linear regression analysis was used to assess strength of association between age and mean cartilage score. Univariable regression analysis was performed and variables with p < 0.2 were used in the final mixed-effects multivariable model to which backwards stepwise selection was applied. Significance level was p < 0.05. Results: Cartilage injury was present in 28.8% (95% CI = 25.8–32.0) of joints. Lameness was not associated with fragment location or fragment size. Fragment size was not associated with cartilage injury. Age (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.22–1.48, p < 0.001) and lameness (OR = 5.03, 95% CI = 2.27–11.68, p < 0.001) were associated with cartilage injury as well as fragment location (palmar/plantar, OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.13–0.38, p < 0.001), with dorsal fragments being more likely to be associated with cartilage lesions than palmar/plantar fragments. There was a significant association between age and mean cartilage score (b = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.14–0.22, p < 0.001). Main limitations: The series included a heterogenous group of horses of different breed, sex, age and use. Data were collected retrospectively and could, in parts, not be fully evaluated. Conclusions: Early fragment removal, especially in joints with dorsal fragmentation, can be beneficial to avoid future cartilage injuries in equine athletes. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Genetic parentage tests have great relevance in breed registration processes in equine specimens. In addition, these tests are used to verify progeny genetic accuracy, using microsatellite molecular markers (STR) as a method for individual identification and kinship between individuals. Specifically, we evaluated a Colombian Creole breed equine population, using blood, saliva, and hair samples as sources of DNA. The samples were extracted using Chelex chelating resins. DNA quantification was performed by NanoDrop and amplified by PCR using the 17 STRs included in the Equine Genotypes panel 1.1 kit. Subsequently, electrophoresis was performed and stained with SYBR safe, and genotypes were determined using capillary electrophoresis. Additionally, the allelic and genotypic frequencies were calculated using the GENEPOP software and the previously obtained genetic profiles. Also, the HWE, heterozygosity per locus, inbreeding, and gametic imbalance were estimated. As a result, some genetic markers such as ASB23, ASB17, and LEX3 were not suitable for executing the tests since they biased the population parameters. However, we recommend expanding the equine population and using more STRs to obtain better results in these genetic tests in future population studies. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Previous research revealed that several seminal plasma (SP) metabolites are related to sperm functionality, fertility, and preservation. While it is understood that variations between species exist, whether the SP metabolome differs between donkeys and horses has not been previously investigated. The aim of this work, therefore, was to characterize and compare donkey and horse SP metabolites using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and relate them to sperm viability and motility. For this purpose, ejaculates from 18 different donkeys and 18 different horses were collected and separated into two aliquots: one for harvesting the SP by centrifugation and obtaining the metabolic profile through NMR, and the other for evaluating sperm viability and motility. Based on total motility and sperm viability, samples were classified as with good (GQ) or poor (PQ) quality. The metabolomic profile of donkey and horse SP revealed the presence of 28 metabolites, which coincided in the two species. Yet, differences between horses and donkeys were observed in the concentration of 18 of these 28 metabolites, as well as between ejaculates classified as GQ or PQ and in the relationship of metabolites with sperm motility and viability. These findings suggest that sperm from donkeys and horses differ in their metabolism and energetic requirements, and that the concentration of specific SP metabolites may be related to sperm functionality. Further research should shed light on the metabolic needs of donkey and horse sperm, and evaluate how the knowledge collected from the contribution of these metabolites can help improve semen preservation in the two species. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Horses are companion animals that are reared for multipurpose such as riding, racing, plowing, pulling carts, etc. Therefore, the population of horses is increasing in Punjab. Horses are very sensitive to internal parasites and may frequently be prone to infection caused by small strongyles. Nematodes are responsible for poor health, reduced growth, weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, gestational lesions, liver damage, and a high mortality rate. The management strategies practiced by the farm owners have an impact on the prevalence of parasitic infections in animals. Farmers adopt different management practices for the well-being of horses. Anthelmintic drugs are the primary control method for their prevention. The drugs used for parasite control give varying efficacy. Therefore, a study was planned to conduct a questionnaire-based survey in Punjab to estimate the stud farmer's practices for parasite control and to check the efficacy of 6 brands of drugs commercially available in Punjab. The data of the questionnaire was recorded on Google Forms and fecal samples were also collected from various stud farms for egg hatch assay. Based on the survey, Systamax® was the most widely accepted brand of anthelmintic by farmers for the treatment of helminth infections in horses (82.98%). In the egg hatch assay, it is estimated that Parazole® had the lowest dose (0.2 mg/mL) at which 50% inhibition of cyathostomins egg hatching occurred. While Oxafax® showed the highest dose (2.4 mg/mL) at which 50% inhibition of egg hatching occurred. In vitro, the efficacy of Oxafax® was less as compared to other brands. However, the dose-response of all six brands had a non-significant difference. It is concluded that the different strategies adopted by horse owners had a role in the prevalence of parasitic infections in horses and all six brands had varying efficacy against small nematodes. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), which encompasses insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and predisposition to laminitis is a critical endocrine disorder among the most prevalent conditions affecting horses from different breeds. According to the most recent research, low human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) serum levels correlate with an increased risk of obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and may contribute to overall metabolic dysregulations. This study aimed to test whether exogenous SHBG could protect EMS affected adipose-derived stromal stem cells (EqASCEMS) from apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress and thus improve insulin sensitivity. Methods: EqASCEMS wells were treated with two different concentrations (50 and 100 nM) of exogenous SHBG, whose biocompatibility was tested after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation. Several parameters including cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species levels, ER stress, Pi3K/MAPK activation and insulin transducers expression were analysed. Results: Obtained data demonstrated that exogenous SHBG treatment significantly promoted ASCs cells proliferation, cell cycle and survival with reduced expression of p53 and p21 pro-apoptotic mediators. Furthermore, SHBG alleviated the oxidative stress caused by EMS and reduced the overaccumulation of intracellular ROS, by reducing ROS + cell percentage and regulating gene expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (Sod 1, Cat, GPx), SHBG treatment exhibited antioxidant activity by modulating total nitric oxide (NO) levels in EMS cells as well. SHBG treatment dampened the activation of ER stress sensors and effectors in EqASCEMS cells via the upregulation of MiR-7a-5p, the decrease in the expression levels of ATF-6, CHOP and eiF2A and the restoration of PDIA3 chaperone protein levels. As a consequence, SHBG application substantially improved insulin sensitivity through the modulation of Pi3K/Akt/Glut4 insulin signalling cascades. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the SHBG is endowed with crucial beneficial effects on ASCs metabolic activities and could serve as a valuable therapeutic target for the development of efficient EMS treatment protocols.

ABSTRACT: Moellerella wisconsensis is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacillus of Entero-bacteriaceae family, and it is an uncommon pathogen in domestic animals. To date, five cases were reported including two dogs, two cattle, and a goat. Streptococcus equisimilis is the second common bacterial agent after the S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus in equine pneumonia cases. The present report describes the isolation of M. wisconses from lungs and spleen of a 10-year-old Arabian horse (May 08, 2022) at post-mortem examination being co-infected with S. equisimilis. Clinical and pathological findings included bilateral nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, sternal recumbency, severe diffuse necrosuppurative rhinitis, multi-focal fibrinopurulent pneumonia and purulent lymphadenitis. Polymerase chain reaction assays showed no viral nucleic acids of equid alphaherpesvirus (EHV) 1, EHV-4, equine arteritis virus and equine papilloma virus. The antibiogram test revealed that the isolate was sensitive to several antibiotics except colistin. Taken together, the present report documents the first isolation of M. wisconsensis from lungs and spleen of a horse; hence, experimental studies are needed to clarify the pathogenity and pathogenesis of M. wisconsensis. © 2023 Urmia University.

ABSTRACT: Background: For centuries, morphology has been the most commonly selected trait in horses. A 3D video recording enabled us to obtain the coordinates of 43 anatomical landmarks of 2089 jumping horses. Generalized Procrustes analysis provided centered and scaled coordinates that were independent of volume, i.e., centroid size. Genetic analysis of these coordinates (mixed model; 17,994 horses in the pedigree) allowed us to estimate a variance–covariance matrix. New phenotypes were then defined: the “summarized shapes”. They were obtained by linear combinations of Procrustes coordinates with, as coefficients, the eigenvectors of the genetic variance–covariance matrix. These new phenotypes were used in genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) and multitrait genetic analysis that included judges’ scores and competition results of the horses. Results: We defined ten shapes that represented 86% of the variance, with heritabilities ranging from 0.14 to 0.42. Only one of the shapes was found to be genetically correlated with competition success (rg = − 0.12, standard error = 0.07). Positive and negative genetic correlations between judges’ scores and shapes were found. This means that the breeding objective defined by judges involves improvement of anatomical parts of the body that are negatively correlated with each other. Known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosomes 1 and 3 for height at withers were significant for centroid size but not for any of the shapes. As these SNPs were not associated with the shape that distinguished rectangular horses from square horses (with height at withers greater than body length), we hypothesize that these SNPs play a role in the overall development of horses, i.e. in height, width, and length but not in height at withers when standardized to unit centroid size. Several other SNPs were found significant for other shapes. Conclusions: The main application of 3D morphometric analysis is the ability to define the estimated breeding value (EBV) of a sire based on the shape of its potential progeny, which is easier for breeders to visualize in a single synthetic image than a full description based on linear profiling. However, the acceptance of these new phenotypes by breeders and the complex nature of summarized shapes may be challenging. Due to the low genetic correlations of the summarized shapes with jumping performance, the methodology did not allow indirect performance selection criteria to be defined. © 2023, ’Institut National de Recherche en Agriculture, Alimentation et Environnement (INRAE).

ABSTRACT: Background: Behavioural models are widely used within human medicine to understand beliefs and intention associated with major health interventions. Objectives: To investigate horse-owner beliefs and practices associated with emergency colic planning. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: An online survey incorporating the Trans-Theoretical Model of behaviour change and the Theory of Planned Behaviour was developed to assess owner intention to adopt three areas of emergency colic planning: (1) prevention/recognition, (2) involvement of others and (3) personal preparation. Participants were recruited using a snowball sampling strategy; multivariable logistic regression of data was performed. Results: There were 701 horse-owners who completed the survey. Respondents fell into one of two categories: no intention to adopt or already implementing emergency planning recommendations. Most agreed that emergency colic plans would improve their horse's welfare (68%) and aid in decision making (78%). Most disagreed that colic was inevitable (66%) and that treatment options were not within their control (69%). Multivariable analysis showed that those who believed emergency plans were worth creating were more likely to adopt preventive (OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.27–4.30, p = 0.007) and personal preparation (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.31–1.97, p < 0.001) recommendations. Preventive recommendations were also associated with ‘REACT’ campaign awareness (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.40–3.97, p = 0.001). Favourable behavioural beliefs, such as the acknowledgement of welfare and decision-making benefits, were linked to the involvement of others in planning (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.78–4.81, p < 0.001). Main limitations: Potential response bias and small sample size. Conclusions: The majority of owners were either unwilling to adopt suggested recommendations or believed that their approach was currently sufficient. Most owners perceived veterinary professionals as most influential on their decision to plan for a colic emergency, highlighting their importance in any educational campaign. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes the case of a 14-year-old mare suffering from recurrent oesophageal obstruction caused by tracheal ring deformity. The anomaly provoking proximal oesophagus entrapment was characterised by a protrusion of the dorsal extremities of the cartilage rings, further diagnosed by computed tomography. Tracheal ring deformity should be considered as a rare cause of recurrent oesophageal obstruction. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: With greater availability of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) due to recent legislation, hempseed meal (HSM) should be evaluated as a potential feedstuff for livestock. The study objective was to evaluate the palatability of HSM in horses. Trial 1 used a modified 3 × 3 Latin Square design utilizing three geldings and three mares. Feeding periods (6d) consisted of two feedings/d with a washout phase (3d) before each treatment phase (3d). During treatment, horses were offered soybean meal pellets (SBM), rice bran pellets (RBP), or beet pulp pellets (BPP) in one bucket (500 g) and HSM in a second bucket (500 g) each feeding. In Trial 2, six geldings were offered 1 kg of HSM pellets over two 5-minute periods, 1 hour apart each day, with 1kg of Coastal Bermudagrass hay between offerings. Consumption of HSM in Trial 1 was greater than SBM (P = .005) and BPP (P < .001) but not different from RBP (P = .19). Consumption of HSM increased with each subsequent period (P < .001). In Trial 2, intake of HSM on d1, d2, and d3 were less than d6 (P < .05). Hay consumption was greater on d1 and d2 than d6 (P < .01). Hay consumption and HSM intake were not correlated (R2 = 0.001). These findings indicate that HSM may be similar in palatability to RBP and more palatable than SBM and BPP. Consumption of HSM increases over time, but is not impacted by hay consumption. In equine rations, HSM may serve as an acceptable replacement to more common feedstuffs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This review describes the physiological role of cortisol in the horses’ body and the usefulness of cortisol concentration measurements in assessing welfare and diagnosing diseases. Cortisol is examined in terms of its production and functions, along with the concept of circadian cortisol rhythms and potential disruptions in these patterns. The significance of cortisol concentration is emphasized, as it provides insights into stress levels, and the connection between cortisol and stereotypical horse behaviors, raising the question of whether these behaviors signify stress or serve as coping mechanisms. Moreover, cortisol concentration helps in diagnosing various health conditions such as Cushing’s Disease, inflammation, and metabolic imbalances. As cortisol concentration is considered a stress indicator that may be affected by the sampling protocol, the matrices for cortisol sampling and their practical applications are summarized. In this review, three major cortisol sampling methods: plasma, salivary, and hair cortisol, are described in detail. Plasma cortisol measurements offer acute stress insights, while salivary cortisol analysis provides a non-invasive method for continuous stress monitoring. Hair cortisol, on the other hand, offers an assessment of long-term stress levels. This text underscores the importance of cortisol control in safeguarding the welfare and health of horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Since ancient times, horses were identified for their unique aerobic capacity. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate alteration in clinical, haematological, and biochemical parameters after exercise in horses. Twenty apparently healthy non-pregnant females of approximately equal age group (8-10 years) were divided into group I and II. Group I was given 30 kilometres of trot exercise for two hours and Group II was taken as the control without giving exercise. Recording of clinical parameters and collection of blood samples were done both at rest and after exercise in the case of group I but without exercise in group II. Clinical parameters viz. rectal temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate; haematological parameters viz. haemoglobin, PCV, TEC, TLC, DLC, and platelet count; and biochemical parameters viz ALT, AST, GGT, total protein, albumin, creatinine, BUN, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin were investigated in the present research. All the clinical parameters viz. rectal temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate were increased significantly after the exercise. Among haematological parameters, haemoglobin and PCV were significantly higher after exercise in the treatment group while no effect of exercise was observed on TEC, TLC, DLC, and platelet count. There was no effect of exercise found on any of the biochemical parameters in the present study. Alteration in clinico-haemato-biochemical parameters in horses affirms physiological adjustment to maintain desired performance throughout, and also most of the parameters were close to normal range. © 2023, Veterinary Practitioner.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this retrospective, observational, controlled study was to evaluate bone and soft tissue window CT images of the proximoplantar metatarsus III region in twenty horses with pain localized to the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL) and 20 horses with findings nonrelated to tarsal pain. All horses underwent CT and radiographic examination. Images were reviewed by three independent observers who graded the severity and localization of findings. Bone-related categories as well as soft tissue-related categories were evaluated. For the comparison of imaging findings in horses with and without proximal suspensory desmitis (PSD), mixed linear regression was performed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess intraobserver agreement, and kappa statistics were employed to evaluate interobserver agreement. CT examination identified significantly more abnormalities in the diseased group. The scores for osseous exostosis (p =.015) and PSL enlargement (p =.004) were notably higher in PSD horses compared to controls. Intraobserver agreement was overall high (ICC.82–1.0), and interobserver agreement was substantial for the detection of mineralization (kappa =.61) and moderate for sclerosis (kappa =.43), exostosis (kappa =.43), and PSL enlargement (kappa =.48/.51). Measurements in the soft tissue window were significantly smaller than those in the bone window. Findings concurrent with PSD including osseous proliferation and sclerosis as well as soft tissue enlargement, mineralization, and avulsion can be reliably detected using CT. Findings from the current study supported the use of CT for evaluating horses with suspected PSD where high-field MRI is not available. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Right dorsal colitis (RDC) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced, protein losing enteropathy in horses associated with a high case fatality rate. Objectives: To describe signalment, NSAID usage, clinical presentations, clinical pathology, ultrasonographic findings, treatments, outcomes, and factors associated with survival in horses diagnosed with RDC. Animals: Thirty-five horses from 7 Australian equine hospitals diagnosed with RDC. Methods: Retrospective case series. Clinical records of cases were accepted if definitively or presumptively diagnosed by an internist with RDC and had ≥3 of: hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia; diarrhea with negative test results for infectious diseases; colic for which other diseases were excluded or right dorsal colon thickening on ultrasound. Descriptive data analysis was performed for categorical and continuous variables. Univariate binominal logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with survival. Results: An overdose of NSAIDs occurred in 84% (21/25) cases where dose was known. Common clinical presentations included diarrhea (69%; 22/32), colic (61%; 20/33), and tachycardia (53%, 17/32). Common clinicopathological findings included hypoalbuminemia (83%; 26/31), hypocalcaemia (79%, 23/29), and hyperlactatemia (77%, 14/18). The right dorsal colon wall appeared subjectively thickened in 77% (24/31) cases using ultrasonography. Case fatality rate was 43% (15/35). Odds of survival significantly decreased with increasing heart rate (odds 0.84, 95% CI = 0.71-0.92, P =.01), packed cell volume (odds 0.91, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, P =.05) and abnormal appearance of mucous membranes (odds 0.05, 95% CI 0.005-0.28, P =.001) on hospital presentation. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: An overdose of NSAIDs is common in horses diagnosed with RDC. Serum albumin concentrations should be monitored in horses receiving a prolonged course of NSAIDs. Overall prognosis for RDC remains fair. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.

ABSTRACT: Hydrotherapy has been utilized in horse rehabilitation programs for over four decades. However, a comprehensive description of the swimming cycle of horses is still lacking. One of the challenges in studying this motion is 3D underwater motion capture, which holds potential not only for understanding equine locomotion but also for enhancing human swimming performance. In this study, a marker-based system that combines underwater cameras and markers drawn on horses is developed. This system enables the reconstruction of the 3D motion of the front and hind limbs of six horses throughout an entire swimming cycle, with a total of twelve recordings. The procedures for pre- and post-processing the videos are described in detail, along with an assessment of the estimated error. This study estimates the reconstruction error on a checkerboard and computes an estimated error of less than 10 mm for segments of tens of centimeters and less than 1 degree for angles of tens of degrees. This study computes the 3D joint angles of the front limbs (shoulder, elbow, carpus, and front fetlock) and hind limbs (hip, stifle, tarsus, and hind fetlock) during a complete swimming cycle for the six horses. The ranges of motion observed are as follows: shoulder: 17 ± 3°; elbow: 76 ± 11°; carpus: 99 ± 10°; front fetlock: 68 ± 12°; hip: 39 ± 3°; stifle: 68 ± 7°; tarsus: 99 ± 6°; hind fetlock: 94 ± 8°. By comparing the joint angles during a swimming cycle to those observed during classical gaits, this study reveals a greater range of motion (ROM) for most joints during swimming, except for the front and hind fetlocks. This larger ROM is usually achieved through a larger maximal flexion angle (smaller minimal angle of the joints). Finally, the versatility of the system allows us to imagine applications outside the scope of horses, including other large animals and even humans. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Kentucky bluegrass, an invasive cool-season grass in the US northern Great Plains, embodies the Greek story of the Trojan horse in which an apparent gift initially seems to bestow benefits but ultimately becomes harmful and subversive. Its competitive nature and early spring growth give it an advantage over native cool season grasses. This early and prolific growth provides forage for livestock but eventually leads to a decrease in other plant species and to negative impacts to multiple ecosystem services. Developing effective landscape-scale management techniques for invasives like Kentucky bluegrass depends on understanding the perceptions, coping capacity, and management abilities of private landowners. Through a mail survey conducted in North Dakota, this research provides insight into the cognitive processes that motivate agricultural landowners to manage Kentucky bluegrass and investigates psychological factors that constrain or enable the implementation of management behaviors. The results showed that less than half of the landowners surveyed had a management goal for Kentucky bluegrass, and among those with such goals, the perceived capacity to cope with the species was moderate to low. The majority of landowners who wanted to decrease the abundance of Kentucky bluegrass on their rangelands did not believe they could effectively do so. This highlights the need for the rangeland science and extension community to develop effective and feasible management techniques and conservation programs that integrate research findings to provide viable solutions. Participatory processes that include diverse interested and affected parties and rights holders can provide social learning environments conducive to the joint exploration of problems and refinement of actionable solutions. Through the focus on Kentucky bluegrass in the northern Great Plains, our research approach and recommendations also provide transferable insights for invasive species management and conservation in other social-ecological systems. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Background: Electrolyte supplementation may be a risk factor for gastric mucosal lesions, but relevant evidence is limited in horses. Hypothesis: Investigate the effects of PO sodium chloride (NaCl) supplementation on the gastric mucosa of exercising horses. We hypothesized that NaCl supplementation would neither cause nor exacerbate existing gastric mucosal damage. Animals: Fifteen 3-year-old healthy Warmblood stallions from a stud farm. Methods: Placebo-controlled study with a crossover design. Horses were fed either a NaCl pellet at a dosage adequate to replace the electrolyte losses in 10 L sweat or a placebo for 19 days with a washout period of 14 days between treatments. The gastric mucosa was evaluated by gastroscopy before and after treatment. Blood samples were collected for evaluation of acid-base status, packed cell volume (PCV), and total protein, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations. Urine was collected, and urine specific gravity, electrolyte, creatinine, and urea concentrations were measured. Results: The initial prevalence of gastric mucosal lesions was 85%. Sodium chloride pellets did not adversely affect the gastric mucosa and treatment did not significantly alter the hematologic and serum biochemical variables. Urine creatinine concentrations significantly decreased and urinary sodium concentrations significantly increased after supplementation with NaCl pellets. Water intake did not significantly differ between treatments. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Daily NaCl pellet supplementation is a palatable and safe way to replace electrolyte losses from sweating in exercising horses and has no negative effects on the gastric mucosa. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The use of dexamethasone to control equine asthma is a common and effective treatment. Although short-term systemic dexamethasone treatment has not been shown to induce systemic immunosuppression in the horse, the goal of this study was to determine whether inhaled ciclesonide, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of equine asthma, exerts any systemic immunosuppressive effects when compared to dexamethasone-treated and untreated horses. Eighteen light, mixed breed horses, ranging in age from 3 to 8 years of age, were used for this study and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) nontreated controls, (2) ciclesonide treatment, or (3) dexamethasone treatment. Blood was collected daily for steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis, as well as at Days 0, 5, 10, and 15 of treatment for in vitro stimulation with Concanavalin A (ConA). Messenger RNA relative quantities were determined using RT-qPCR for select genes. Two-way, repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze qPCR data and results considered significant at P < .05. There were significant decreases in the steady-state, whole-blood expression of granzyme B and interferon-γ due to dexamethasone treatment, when compared to the nontreated control group. Within ConA-stimulated samples, there remained a suppressive effect of dexamethasone treatment on granzyme B expression compared to nontreated control horses. Similar effects were not noted in the ciclesonide-treated horses. Significant effects of ciclesonide treatment on markers of immune function were not noted in this study, suggesting a low risk for immunosuppression with inhaled ciclesonide treatment. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe a population of horses with acute kidney injury (AKI) following administration of bisphosphonates including clinical signs, clinicopathologic data, treatment, and outcome. Design: Retrospective study from August 2013 to July 2020. Setting: Veterinary university teaching hospital. Animals: Eight adult horses with AKI following administration of nonnitrogenous bisphosphonates. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Five horses received intramuscular clodronate (5/8; 62.5%) and 3 horses received intravenous tiludronate (3/8; 37.5%). Six horses (6/8; 75%) received concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common initial presenting complaint was poor appetite (6/8; 75%), followed by abnormal urination (2/8; 25%). At the time of initial evaluation, the mean serum or plasma creatinine was 451.72 ± 190.06 μmol/L (5.11 ± 2.15 mg/dL) and BUN was 18.84 ± 8.85 mmol/L (52.75 ± 24.77 mg/dL). Five horses (5/6; 83.3%) had either an increased number of red blood cells (n = 4) or hemoprotein (n = 1) in the urine. All horses were treated with IV isotonic, balanced crystalloids either as a bolus, continuous rate infusion, or a combination of the 2. Seven horses (7/8; 87.5%) survived the initial episode of AKI and 1 horse (1/8; 12.5%) was euthanized. Of the 7 surviving horses, 2 horses (2/7; 28.5%) went on to develop chronic renal dysfunction. Warmblood breeds were overrepresented in the AKI group (P = 0.008; odds ratio: 11.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.8–72.1), when compared to horses that received bisphosphonates during the study period and did not develop AKI. Conclusions: Bisphosphonate administration, with or without concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can be associated with AKI in horses. Serum creatinine should be monitored prior to and following bisphosphonate treatment to minimize this risk. Further evaluation of renal function is warranted in horses that develop clinical signs of poor appetite, lethargy, or altered urination in the days following bisphosphonate treatment. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: Antimicrobial drug-associated diarrhea (AAD) is the most common adverse effect in horses receiving antimicrobials. Little information on how oral administration of antimicrobials alters intestinal microbiota in horses is available. Objective: Investigate changes of the fecal microbiota in response to oral administration of antimicrobials. Animals: Twenty healthy horses. Methods: Prospective, longitudinal study. Horses were randomly assigned to 4 groups comprising 4 horses each: group 1 (metronidazole); group 2 (erythromycin); group 3 (doxycycline); group 4 (sulfadiazine/trimethoprim, SMZ-TMP); and group 5 (control). Antimicrobials were administered for 5 days. Fecal samples were obtained before (day 0) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 30 days of the study period. Fecal microbiota was characterized by high throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA. Results: Horses remained healthy throughout the study. Richness and diversity in doxycycline, erythromycin, and metronidazole, but not SMZ-TMP groups, was significantly lower (P <.05) at multiple time points after administration of antimicrobials compared with samples from day 0. Main changes in the microbiota were observed during the time of antimicrobial administration (day 2-5; weighted and unweighted UniFrac PERMANOVA P <.05). Administration of erythromycin, doxycycline and, to a lesser extent, metronidazole produced a pronounced alteration in the microbiota compared with day 0 samples by decreasing the abundance of Treponema, Fibrobacter, and Lachnospiraceae and increasing Fusobacterium and Escherichia-Shigella. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Oral administration of antimicrobials alters the intestinal microbiota of healthy horses resembling horses with dysbiosis, potentially resulting in intestinal inflammation and predisposition to diarrhea. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine how a horse s gait changes over an eight-week shoeing period and if these changes could be picked up by a single sensor inertial measurement unit (IMU) fitted with a GPS receiver chip. The device employed in this study was the ALOGO Move ProTM. It was also of interest to measure the radiographic changes throughout this period to determine if these physical changes were tied to the kinematic parameters measured by the sensor. The study was performed using 21 Swiss Warmblood horses belonging to the Swiss Armed Forces and consisted of two rounds of testing. Each round was comprised of balance radiographs of all four feet (dorsopalmar/-plantar and lateromedial projections) and dynamic tests, both in hand and on a 20 m lunging circle. Round one invariably began on the day the horse was shod with the second round following eight weeks later. The measured variables were separated into four categories: dynamic values (stride height, stride length and strike power), balance values (longitudinal and lateral balance), radiographic values (palmar/plantar angle and toe length) and the height at the withers. Palmar/plantar angles decreased over the eight-week period but were only significant in the hind feet (average difference 1.81°). Stride length was significantly greater in round two in all measurements at the trot (average difference 16.48 cm) and canter (average difference 33.56 cm), and stride height was significantly greater in the second round for one of the tests performed at the trot (trot on right rein) (average difference 0.66 cm) and both tests at the canter (average difference 1.00 cm). Bigger horses were found to lean more towards the inside of the circle near the end of their shoeing period. In addition, a horse s height at the withers and its longitudinal balance showed a negative correlation towards the end of the shoeing period. There were also similar correlations between a horse s stride length and its longitudinal balance shifting towards the front, when horses reach the end of a shoeing period, those with longer strides will lean even further forwards than others. It is important to note that although these changes happen gradually over an eight-week period, the inverse changes happen instantly when the horses are trimmed and shod. These results complement previous research showing that horses tend to carry more weight on their forelimbs when traveling at higher speeds, as a horse s velocity and stride length are directly correlated. This study demonstrates that the ALOGO Move ProTM device can accurately measure changes in a horse s gait over the course of an eight-week shoeing interval. This device could be therefore used in further studies and tests, and, with enough data, there might be potential for this sensor to learn and identify evolving patterns within a shoeing period. This could result in the capacity of the device to be able to inform the rider or trainer when the optimal time to have the horse reshod is, based on how the horse s balance evolves over time. © 2023 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Background: Intravenous pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of cannabidiol (CBD) with different formulations have not been investigated in horses and may represent a starting point for clinical studies. Objectives: To describe pharmacokinetics after intravenous and oral administrations with oil and micellar formulations and simulate different treatments. Study design: Single intravenous experiment and two-way randomised oral experiments, Latin-square design. Methods: Eight healthy horses received intravenous CBD at 1.00 mg/kg dose, oral CBD in sesame oil and in micellar formulation, both at 10.00 mg/kg. Concentrations were measured using LC–MS/MS and fitted by nonlinear mixed effect modelling. Parameters obtained were used to simulate single and multiple treatments at steady state. Results: Intravenous and oral concentrations were simultaneously fitted using a three-compartment model. Final estimates indicate that CBD has a volume of distribution of 36 L/kg associated with a systemic clearance of 1.46 L/h/kg and half-lives ranged between 24 and 34 h. Oral bioavailability was close to 14% for both oral administrations. Simulated dose regimen of CBD every 12 and 24 h predicted similar percentages to reach effective plasma concentration with both oral formulation at 10.00 mg/kg. Main limitations: A small horse population was used (8 horses per trial). Conclusions and clinical importance: Oral bioavailability was low at the doses studied but fell within the range described for horse and other species. CBD had a high steady-state volume of distribution, a high clearance and long half-lives. No adverse reactions were detected at any dose or route. The micellar formulation showed a faster absorption and higher concentration peak, while the oil formulation presented lower levels, but more maintained over time. Simulations predicted that both could be useful in multiple oral dose treatments. These results indicated that CBD could be of interest, but further studies are needed to evaluate its clinical use in horses. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: High concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are used as an indicator of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), but other factors that may influence ACTH need to be understood, if diagnostic reference ranges for ACTH are to be used with confidence. Insulin dysregulation (ID) could be one such factor, as insulin affects pituitary hormones in other species. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that a relationship exists between high insulin and high ACTH in aged (>15-year-old) animals with no clinical signs of PPID. Study design: A cohort study. Methods: Thirteen horses and eleven ponies (17–25 years-old; mares and geldings) were clinically examined for signs of PPID in the spring (November 2020) and autumn (April 2021). On the same day, blood samples were taken before and 2 h after an oral glucose test (OGT). Concentrations of insulin, glucose, ACTH and cortisol were measured. Results: There was no association between ACTH and cortisol. However, there was a positive linear correlation between ACTH and post-OGT (insulin in the autumn (r = 0.427, p = 0.04). Two horses and six ponies had ACTH above the cut-off value for PPID diagnosis, and of these eight animals, six also had insulin concentrations above the cut-off value for ID. Main limitations: The cohort was small and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests were not performed. Conclusions: In autumn, high ACTH was associated with ID, when no clinical signs of PPID were present.

ABSTRACT: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is characterized by its dense fibrotic microenvironment and highly malignant nature, which are associated with chemotherapy resistance and very poor prognosis. Although circRNAs have emerged as important regulators in cancer biology, their role in ICC remains largely unclear. Herein, a circular RNA, cPKM is identified, which is upregulated in ICC and associated with poor prognosis. Silencing cPKM in ICC cells reduces TGFB1 release and stromal fibrosis, inhibits STMN1 expression, and suppresses ICC growth and metastasis, moreover, it also leads to overcoming paclitaxel resistance. This is regulated by the interactions of cPKM with miR-199a-5p or IGF2BP2 and by the ability of cPKM to stabilize STMN1/TGFB1 mRNA. Based on these findings, a Trojan horse nanotherapy strategy with co-loading of siRNA against cPKM (si-cPKM) and paclitaxel (PTX) is developed. The siRNA/PTX co-loaded nanosystem (Trojan horse) efficiently penetrates tumor tissues, releases si-cPKM and paclitaxel (soldiers), promotes paclitaxel sensitization, and suppresses ICC proliferation and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, it alleviates the fibrosis of ICC tumor stroma and reopens collapsed tumor vessels (opening the gates), thus enhancing the efficacy of the standard chemotherapy regimen (main force). This novel nanotherapy provides a promising new strategy for ICC treatment. © 2023 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Oncolytic viruses (OVs) exert a high level of antitumor potency without causing harm to normal cells. Current oncolytic virotherapy is mainly limited to the intratumoral injection of viral particles, while systemic administration provides the opportunity to treat metastatic neoplasia as well as the primary tumor. Despite promising outcomes in preclinical studies, systemic administration of oncolytic viruses has shown little success in patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by most mammalian cell types, both in pathologic and physiologic conditions and exert a wide range of biological functions in intercellular communication. Extracellular vesicles are also involved in viral infection, and it has been shown that viruses affect the generation and content of these particles. This review aimed to summarize the current knowledge of EV involvement in viral infection and discuss their potential as vehicles for systemic delivery of OVs. Methods: The relationships between oncolytic viruses and EVs were studied by searching specific phrases like “systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses by extracellular vesicles” PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Results: Numerous articles have suggested the role of extracellular vesicles in the spread of viruses, and several evidence demonstrated that these particles efficiently deliver the oncolytic viruses to the target sites through systemic infusion. Conclusion: Due to the role of extracellular vesicles in the spread of viruses, they can be used as a tool for systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses. Lay Summary: It has been established that oncolytic viruses (OVs) have a high level of antitumor potency without causing harm to normal cells. Despite promising outcomes in preclinical studies, systemic administration of OV has exert little success in patients due to the rapid clearance of the viruses, as a result of host immune response. It has been established that EVs are involved in viral infection, and it has been shown that viruses affect the generation and content of EVs. This review will summarize the current knowledge of EV involvement in viral infection and discuss their potential as vehicles for systemic delivery of OVs. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

ABSTRACT: Androstenone, which derived from boar pheromones, known as an interomone, has been documented to change behavior in dogs and horses. It could be a potential candidate for use in pheromonal therapy in horses. This study aimed to investigate the effect of androstenone treatment for improving the safety of horseback riding by reducing undesirable behavior of horses. In this study, fourteen horses were participated in a series of behavior tests with one rider to determine the effects of androstenone on behaviors. First, in the riding test without obstacles, the riding session lasted for 30 minutes with 5 minutes of walking, 10 minutes of trotting, 10 minutes of cantering, and 5 minutes of walking. The frequency of undesirable behavior during the riding sessions was monitored. Second, in the riding test with obstacles, the time to pass through from start line to finish line through an obstacle course was recorded. The course was organized with three consecutive blue tarps. Both tests used a cross-over design with 20 μg of androstenone. In the riding test without obstacles, horses exhibited a significantly reduced frequency of undesirable behavior when treated with androstenone (P < 0.05). During obstacle course test, the horses completed the course faster under the influence of androstenone (P < 0.05). The placebo treatment did not result in a significant behavioral change in either test. These preliminary findings, limited by the small number of horses and the rider, warrant further invesgitation to substantiate the efficacy of androstenone for pheromonal therapy in equine practices. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the effect of a 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution on the peak concentration (CMAX) of amikacin in the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) during intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) compared with 0.9% NaCl. Study design: Randomized crossover study. Animals: Seven healthy adult horses. Methods: The horses underwent IVRLP with 2 g of amikacin sulfate diluted to 60 mL using a 10% DMSO or 0.9% NaCl solution. Synovial fluid was collected from the RCJ at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after IVRLP. The wide rubber tourniquet placed on the antebrachium was removed after the 30 min sample. Amikacin concentrations were quantified by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The mean CMAX and time to peak concentration (TMAX) of amikacin within the RCJ were determined. A one-sided paired t-test was used to determine the differences between treatments. The significance level was p <.05. Results: The mean ± SD CMAX in the DMSO group was 1361.8 ± 593 μg/mL and in the 0.9% NaCl group it was 860 ± 481.6 μg/mL (p =.058). Mean TMAX using the 10% DMSO solution was 23 and 18 min using the 0.9% NaCl perfusate (p =.161). No adverse effects were associated with use of the 10% DMSO solution. Conclusion: Although there were higher mean peak synovial concentrations using the 10% DMSO solution no difference in synovial amikacin CMAX between perfusate type was detected (p =.058). Clinical significance: Use of a 10% DMSO solution in conjunction with amikacin during IVRLP is a feasible technique and does not negatively affect the synovial amikacin levels achieved. Further research is warranted to determine other effects of using DMSO during IVRLP. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by myofibroblast abnormal activation and extracellular matrix deposition. However, the pathogenesis of PF remains unclear, and treatment options are limited. Epidemiological studies have shown that the average age of PF patients is estimated to be over 65 years, and the incidence of the disease increases with age. Therefore, PF is considered an age-related disease. A preliminary study on PF patients demonstrated that the combination therapy of the anti-senescence drugs dasatinib and quercetin improved physical functional indicators. Given the global aging population and the role of cellular senescence in tissue and organ aging, understanding the impact of cellular senescence on PF is of growing interest. This article systematically summarizes the causes and signaling pathways of cellular senescence in PF. It also objectively analyzes the impact of senescence in AECs and fibroblasts on PF development. Furthermore, potential intervention methods targeting cellular senescence in PF treatment are discussed. This review not only provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding and manipulating cellular senescence, developing new therapies to improve age-related diseases, and extending a healthy lifespan but also offers hope for reversing the toxicity caused by the massive accumulation of senescence cells in humans. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The standard parasite management of horses based on regular anthelmintic treatments, now practiced for decades has resulted in a worrying expansion of resistant helminth populations, which may considerably impair control on the farm level. The aim of the present study was to obtain a retrospective (year 2010 – 2016) nationwide analysis of faecal egg count (FEC) data from the Swiss adult horse population, related to horse age and geographic region. Thirteen labs provided a total of 16,387 FEC data of horses aged four to 39 years (average: 13.6 years). The annual number of performed FEC tests increased from 38 to 4,939 within the observation period. Independent of the annual sample size the yearly patterns of the FEC were very similar. Seventy-eight percent (n = 12,840) of the samples were negative and 90 % (n = 14,720) showed a FEC below 200 strongyle eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces. The annual mean strongyle FEC ranged between 60 and 88 EPG with a total mean of 75 EPG. Horses aged 4–7 years showed a significantly (p < 0.00001) higher mean FEC compared with the other age groups, differences were not significant among the older horses. Based on ZIP codes, samples were allocated by 70.0 %, 6.0 % and 0.2 % to the German-, French- and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland, respectively. With 222 EPG the mean FEC in the French part of Switzerland was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the German-speaking region (60 EPG). Eggs of Parascaris spp., anoplocephalids and Strongyloides westeri were found in 0.36 %, 0.32 % and 0.01 % of the samples, respectively. Based on 3,813 questionnaire feedbacks from owners in 2017 covering a total of 12,689 horses, sixty-eight percent (n = 8,476) were dewormed without diagnosis, two percent (n = 240) were not dewormed at all, whereas for 30 % (n = 3,721) the selective anthelmintic treatment (SAT) concept was applied. The SAT implementation rate differed significantly (p < 0.0005) between regions, with 33 %, 20 % and 25 % for the German-, French- and Italian-speaking areas, respectively. The rate of horses spending 16–24 h on pasture per day was significantly higher in the French-speaking region compared to the German-speaking part of Switzerland (p < 0.0001). In addition, pasture hygiene was practiced at a significantly lower rate in the French-speaking part compared to the German- and Italian-speaking regions (both p < 0.0001). Overall, the shift towards the SAT-concept represents a very promising development with respect to mitigating the further spread of anthelmintic resistance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The equine population in the United States and worldwide now includes a higher percentage of geriatric horses than ever previously recorded, and as methods to treat and manage elderly equids are developed and refined, this aging population will likely continue to expand. A better understanding of how horses age and the effect of age on immunity and disease susceptibility is needed to enable targeted preventative healthcare strategies for aged horses. This review article outlines the current state of knowledge regarding the effect of aging on immunity, vaccine responsiveness, and disease risk in the horse, highlighting similarities and differences to what is observed in aged humans. Horses show similar but milder age-related alterations in immune function to those reported in people. Decreases in lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production and diminished response to vaccination have all been documented in elderly horses, however, increased risk of infectious disease is not commonly reported. Aged horses also show evidence of a proinflammatory state (inflammaging) yet appear less susceptible to the chronic diseases of people for which inflammation is a risk factor. Information is currently lacking as to why the horse does not experience the same risk of age-related disease (e.g., cancer, heart disease, neurodegeneration) as people, although a lack of negative lifestyle habits, differences in diet, exercise, genetics and physiology may all contribute to improved health outcomes in the older horse. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cannabinoid receptors are expressed in human and animal trigeminal sensory neurons; however, the expression in the equine trigeminal ganglion is unknown. Ten trigeminal ganglia from five horses were collected post-mortem from an abattoir. The expression of cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) and type 2 (CB2R), and the cannabinoid-related receptors like transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARɣ), and G protein-related receptor 55 (GPR55) in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) of the horse were studied, using immunofluorescence on cryosections and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. Neurons and glial cells were identified using fluorescent Nissl staining NeuroTrace® and an antibody directed against the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), respectively. Macrophages were identified by means of an antibody directed against the macrophages/microglia marker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1). The protein expression of CB1R, CB2R, TRPV1, and PPARɣ was found in the majority of TG neurons in both cryosections and FFPE sections. The expression of GPR55 immunoreactivity was mainly detectable in FFPE sections, with expression in the majority of sensory neurons. Some receptors were also observed in glial cells (CB2R, TRPV1, PPARγ, and GPR55) and inflammatory cells (PPARγ and GPR55). These results support further investigation of such receptors in disorders of equine trigeminal neuronal excitability. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In order to explore the aromatic differences between Xinjiang cow milk powder and specialty milk powder (donkey, camel, and horse milk powder), Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) analysis was employed to investigate the volatile compounds in these four types of milk powders. A total of 61 volatile substances were detected, with ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols being the primary flavor components in the milk powders. While the aromatic components of the different milk powders showed similarities in terms of types, there were significant differences in their concentrations, exhibiting distinct characteristics for each type. The Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) showed that there were 15, 14, and 23 volatile compounds that could be used for discrimination of cow milk powder against specialty milk powders, respectively. And it was validated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and finally, 8, 6, and 19 volatile compounds were identified as valid differential marker substances. To facilitate visual discrimination between the different milk powders, we established GC-IMS fingerprint spectra based on the final discriminant markers. These studies provide theoretical guidance for the application of volatile compounds to discriminate adulteration of milk powder marketed in Xinjiang. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Poa annua L. (annual bluegrass) is presently the sole invasive vascular plant species to have successfully established in Maritime Antarctica, where it poses a significant conservation threat to native plant species. However, the reasons for its success in the region have yet to be established. Here, we determined whether the invasiveness of P. annua, and its competitiveness with the native Antarctic hairgrass Deschampsia antarctica, is influenced by symbioses formed with seed fungal endophytes, and whether plants derived from seeds from four global regions differ in their performance. Locations: Four regions (Maritime Antarctica, sub-Antarctica, South America and Europe). Methods: Endophyte frequency was measured in P. annua seeds collected from the four regions. The germination, survival, biomass accumulation, flowering and competitiveness with D. antarctica of P. annua plants grown from endophyte-uncolonised and uncolonised seeds was determined in the laboratory. The effects of endophytes on P. annua seed germination and survival and seedling osmoprotection were also assessed in the Maritime Antarctic natural environment using locally-sourced seeds. Results: Endophytes were at least twice as frequent in seeds from Maritime Antarctica than in those from other regions. A higher proportion of endophyte-colonized seeds germinated and survived than did uncolonised seeds, but only when they originated from Maritime Antarctica. Seed endophytes increased the competitiveness of P. annua with D. antarctica, but only for plants grown from Maritime Antarctic seeds. In the field, endophyte-colonized seeds from Maritime Antarctica germinated and survived more frequently than uncolonised seeds, and osmoprotection was higher in seedlings grown from colonized seed. Main Conclusions: The findings indicate beneficial effects of seed endophytes on invasion-related traits of P. annua, such as survival, germination success and flowering. Together with vegetative and reproductive traits facilitating the colonization process, the seed-fungal endophyte symbiosis can be invoked as an important factor explaining the invasiveness of P. annua in Maritime Antarctica. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This report describes the successful treatment of a traumatic splenic abscess by transabdominal drainage under ultrasonographic guidance. The gelding presented for investigation of recurrent pyrexia, mild abdominal pain and weight loss after a penetrating trauma to the caudolateral abdomen 5 weeks previously. At this stage, the abdominal wall had healed and a splenic abscess was diagnosed. Before treatment, mature adhesions between the abdominal wall and the spleen were confirmed by diagnostic laparoscopy in the standing horse. Transabdominal ultrasound-guided drainage was performed, followed by intralesional placement of a balloon catheter for 2 weeks and a silicone drain for an additional week. Postoperatively, the horse was treated with intralesional and systemic antibiotics. The healing process was unremarkable and the horse was discharged 4 weeks postoperatively. At 10 months post-surgery, after the body condition score had normalised, the horse returned to its previous level of performance. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Free choice forage could be the best option regarding horses’ welfare but can lead to increased body weight (BW), and waste of hay. Automatic box feeders (BF) and slow feeders (SF) decrease food waste, but it is unknown how these affect the horses' time-budget (TB). This study compared the effects of feeding free choice hay (FC), to a SF and an automated BF on the horses’ cortisol circadian rhythm (CCR) and behavior by 24-hours continuous behavioral sampling (CBS). The study was designed as a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 15 polo horses divided into 3 groups, for 15 days on each treatment. Every 15 days, BW was assessed, blood collected for CCR analysis, the behavior recorded during the last 24 hours of the last day of each treatment and the video analyzed with CBS. Time spent on all behaviors was evaluated and used for the determination of the animals’ TB. The effects of the different feeders were analyzed with ANOVA. FC horses consumed and wasted more hay daily (16.6 ± 0.5kg) (P < .001), compared with BF (10.4 ± 0.5 kg), and SF (9.30 ± 0.45 kg). FC horses had higher weight gain (P < .001, 23.5 ± 4.6kg), compared to BF (1.2 ± 5.7 kg) and SF (0.37 ± 4.6) kg. FC and SF horses spent more than 50% of the TB foraging, generating a TB similar to grazing horses. BF horses spent less time eating (P < .001), increasing time spent standing, sniffing the ground, and practicing coprophagy (P < .050). BF horses showed the highest aggression (P < .043). CCR was not different among treatments. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abnormalities in hoof shape are usually connected with limb conformation defects. The role of angular hoof deviations is important for longevity in sports competitions and is increasingly recognized as a factor associated with lameness in performance horses. In this paper, we measured the prevalence of four defects related to the angulation of the hoof in the Pura Raza Española horse (PRE): splay-footed forelimb (SFF), pigeon-toed forelimb (PTF), splay-footed rear limb (SFR), and pigeon-toed rear limb (PTR). A total of 51,134 animals were studied, of which only 15.75% did not have any of the four angular hoof defects investigated, while 26.61%, 23.76%, 79.53%, and 3.86% presented SFF, PTF, SFR, and PTR, respectively. Angular defects were evaluated using two different models; model A was a linear scale composed of three categories, where 0 corresponded to the absence of defects, 1 to a minor presence of the defect and 2 to the highest degree of the defect. Model B was composed of two categories, where 0 corresponded to the absence of defects and 1 to the presence of defects, joining classes 1 and 2. We measured the factors influencing the appearance of these defects: age, inbreeding coefficient, sex, and birth stud size. The heritability of each defect was also estimated using a multivariate animal model, using the Gibbsf90+ software from the BLUPF90 family, resulting in heritability estimates of 0.18 (s.d. = 0.009), 0.20 (s.d. = 0.010), 0.11 (s.d. = 0.009), and 0.31 (s.d. = 0.010) for SFF, PTF, SFR, and PTR defects, respectively, for model A, and 0.17 (s.d. = 0.008), 0.19 (s.d. = 0.009), 0.11 (s.d. = 0.009), and 0.29 (s.d. = 0.009) for SFF, PTF, SFR, and PTR defects, respectively, for model B. Finally, the genetic correlation between the diameter of the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and the proportionality index (PI) in relation to the higher or lower prevalence of the defects was analyzed. We concluded that diameter of SDFT development is strongly correlated with inward toe conditions (PTF, PTR; P≠0 ≥ 0.95), while PI is associated with outward toe defects (SFF, SFR; P≠0 ≥ 0.95). © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: In jejunocaecal anastomosis leaving a necrotic ileal stump has been implicated in complications and poor outcomes. Elective inversion of the necrotic stump using a nasogastric tube has been previously described, although this procedure can be cumbersome and can cause caecocolic orifice occlusion. Objective: To describe the use of a new device for elective inversion of necrotic ileal stumps. Study design: Case report. Methods: Details of the four horses that underwent intestinal resection and anastomosis with elective inversion of the ileal stump were retrieved from their medical records. For each case, a device was constructed by securing 0.7 m of hemp tape to a 0.5 m long electrical cable puller. The device was inserted into the ileum and passed through the caecum. The ileal lumen was closed using sutures or staples, and the tape was simultaneously secured to the intestine. The ileum was then resected. A small typhlotomy was performed at the proposed site for jejunocaecal anastomosis. The device was retrieved, the hemp tape was cut, and jejunocaecal anastomosis was completed. Results: The device was easily secured to the intestines. Small enterotomies were sufficient for device insertion and removal. In four clinical cases the procedure was effective in inverting the stump, and three out of the four horses recovered uneventfully and were discharged from the hospital. One horse was euthanised due to colic 27 months following discharge. Main limitations: Small number of cases admitted to single tertiary hospital. Conclusions: The device was effective in inverting the ileal stump in the included clinical cases. By leaving a short, inverted stump, this method may help improve the prognosis for jejunocaecal anastomosis, possibly avoiding certain undesired effects of the procedure. Further studies with large numbers of cases are required. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The research relevance is predefined by the widespread distribution of parasitosis, including helminthiases, alongside constant depasture on the same areas of pastures, which annually causes massive re-infection of horses. In this regard, the research aims to identify the age, seasonal, and territorial dynamics of infection of horses with helminthiases in the context of the districts of the northern region of Kazakhstan. The primary research method was an experimental analysis that allowing to consider the dynamics and causes of horse helminthiases, associated with the prepatent period, the resistance of the organism, and the system of keeping and feeding horses. The study presents the results of studies of horse helminthiases on the territory of the Northern region of Kazakhstan, covering 4 regions that currently exist in 61 agricultural formations. Faecal samples of 4,395 horses were examined by scatological methods and 126 samples – by incomplete helminthological autopsy. As a result of coprolarvoscopic and coprological studies, it was found that in horses, the dominant representatives among the invasive larvae of strongylates are small and large palisade worms. In scatological studies, strongylatosis of the gastrointestinal tract was recorded in 63.9% of cases, oxyurosis in 40.8%, and parascariasis in 25.9%. The study also presents the results of post-mortem diagnostics, which was carried out during the slaughter or due to the death of the horse. © 2023, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

ABSTRACT: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the end-products of physiologic functions in health. Oxidative stress occurs when endogenous antioxidants are insufficient to neutralize ROS in the system. As a result, ROS can damage DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and cell organelles. To obtain accurate measurements of plasma oxidative stress, levels of both oxidants and antioxidants must be measured. This study validates a commercially available, semi-quantitative, photometric analytical system that measures systemic determinants of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROM) and plasma antioxidant capacity (PAC) in stored equine plasma. The objectives of this work were: 1) to validate a photometric analytical system to quantify dROM and PAC in equine plasma; and 2) to determine expected results for these tests in healthy adult horses. We hypothesized that this system would reliably and reproducibly assess dROM and PAC in equine plasma. We observed expected, dose-dependent increases in dROM generated by adding increasing concentrations of H2O2 or ascorbic acid to equine plasma to provide samples containing a known quantity of oxidants or antioxidants respectively. Mean dROM value in healthy horses was 103.3 ±20.7 U. Carr and mean PAC was 2881.0 ± 313.9 U. Cor. This system reliably and reproducibly quantified dROM and PAC in equine plasma samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Show jumping is one of the most popular disciplines in the horse sector, which makes success in show jumping competitions an important breeding goal for many studbooks. Therefore, the genetic evaluation of show jumping performance is of major interest and this is the case for two Belgian Warmblood studbooks: the Belgian Warmblood horse and Zangersheide. In this study, first an improved phenotype for show jumping performance was developed, i.e. adjusted fence height based on a new non-arbitrary method to scale ranking and competition level, which are two major components of success in competitions. Second, we assessed the importance of including a rider effect in genetic models for show jumping performance, this effect being under debate in sport horse breeding. Third, genetic models based on elementary performances and one model based on a summarized performance were compared in terms of model fit, heritabilities and the stability of estimated breeding values to define the most suitable one for the genetic evaluation of show jumping performance. Results: In this study, more than 600,000 Belgian competition records and almost 81,000 horses were used. Genetic evaluations were developed based on elementary performances (Blom-transformed ranking and adjusted fence height) and on a summarized performance (highest level achieved). Estimated heritabilities of Blom-transformed ranking, adjusted fence height and highest level achieved were 0.09, 0.12 and 0.39, respectively. Including a rider effect improved the models for genetic evaluations. Estimated genetic correlations between the studied models were moderate to high (rg = 0.60–0.99). With the best fit model, the accuracy of the estimated breeding value (EBV) for adjusted fence height reached 0.70 for a larger number of stallions and for stallions that tended to be younger. Conclusions: We recommend breeders to implement this new phenotype ‘adjusted fence height’ in breeding programs. It is moderately to highly correlated with Blom-transformed ranking and highest level achieved, a proxy for lifetime success, and is available for selection candidates from an early age onwards. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to assess the body condition score (BCS) and metabolic profile of finalists in the Freio de Ouro competition, stratified by sex. This study examined 84 Crioulo horses, comprising 43 non-pregnant mares and 41 stallions. Morphometric measurements, including BCS, cresty neck score (CNS), neck and heart girth, and assessments of fat depth at the neck and at the tail base, were conducted. Additional derived measurements such as the percentage of body fat (%BF), body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), heart girth:height ratio (HG:HW), and neck circumference:height ratio (NC:HW) were calculated. A subgroup of 53 animals was selected for the evaluation of metabolic parameters, including triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and adiponectin.In terms of BCS, 21% of participants were classified as overweight, with 49% having CNS≥3. Females exhibited greater fat deposition at the tail base and neck, along with higher %BF, FM, and HG:HW ratio, and lower NC:HWcompared to males. Among metabolic variables, females showed higher concentrations of LDH, LDL, CK, and lower concentrations of adiponectin than males. No differences were observed in morphometric measurements between participants that qualified for the final day of the competition and those which were disqualified. The study revealed that despite the rigorous physical demands and preparation required for the Freio de Ouro competition, a percentage of participants were overweight, displaying increased regional fat deposition in the neck. Although no metabolic changes related to increased adiposity were identified, the findings indicate a predisposition to the development of metabolic alterations. Additionally, females exhibited a greater accumulation of fat than males. © 2023 Universidade Estadual de Londrina. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Two cases with open, comminuted, axially displaced fractures of the proximal third of the fourth metatarsal bone were referred to the University Equine Hospital Vienna. Due to concerns regarding the risk of injury to the suspensory ligament and risk of implant infection with an open configuration, surgical treatment with proximal ostectomy of the fractured fourth metatarsal bone was performed in both cases. Based on telephone follow-up, Case 1 was reported to be sound with no significant reaction at the surgical site 22 months following the procedure and Case 2 exhibited intermittent lameness, radiographically evident irregular new bone formation and some residual ultrasonographic changes of the proximal suspensory ligament 17 months after the procedure. Based on the results of this report, a proximal ostectomy facilitated by standing sedation and regional anaesthesia is a valid treatment option in cases of open, axially displaced fractures of the fourth metatarsal bone, minimising perioperative complications but not excluding long-term postoperative complications. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging zoonotic tick-borne disease in East Asia caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV). It is to investigate the presence of SFTSV RNA and antibodies in horses from a slaughterhouse and equestrian centers in the Republic of Korea (ROK). A prevalence study of SFTSV-specific RNA and antibodies was designed from 889 horses in the ROK. Materials and Methods: Serum samples were collected from horses at a slaughterhouse and equestrian centers from 2018 to 2020. To detect the presence of SFTSV, RNA was extracted from the serum samples, and a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted. Sequencing data were analyzed, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis Version 7.0 software. The horse sera were also tested for SFTSV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Twelve of 889 (1.3%) horse sera were positive for SFTSV RNA, and 452 of 887 (51.0%) horse sera were seropositive by ELISA. Among the RT-PCR-positive samples, 12 of the SFTSV S-segment sequences were classified as sub-genotypes B-2 (n = 6) and B-3 (n = 6). ELISA analysis was evaluated by comparison with neutralization test. We investigated SFTSV infection in horses over a 3-year period, but sampling was not performed evenly by season; continuous surveillance of SFTSV in horses is needed. Conclusions: We report the detection of SFTSV RNA and provide serological data on SFTSV prevalence in horses in the ROK. The detection of SFTSV-specific RNA and antibodies in horses, which are in close proximity to humans, suggests that SFTS is an emerging and important health issue, indicating that more attention to its relevance for equestrian workers is needed. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A retrospective cohort study to describe a novel use of a mechanically retained, rigid obturator (RO) to manage maxillary and mandibular persistent pathologic oral communications (PPOCs). This study included 22 horses with PPOC with at least 6 months of follow-up after treatment with a RO. The RO was made with a flowable, bis-acryl-based composite resin. Medical records were analyzed, including case details, obtained imaging, surgical reports, and follow-up information. There were 10 horses that had follow-up examinations by the authors and 8 horses by the referring veterinarian; in 4 horses, follow-up information was obtained by informal telephone interviews with the owner. Complete resolution of clinical signs was obtained in 21 of 22 (95.5%) horses, with confirmed healing of the PPOC in 15 of 22 (68.2%) horses. Complications were noted in 7 of 22 (31.8%) cases. Complications included: complete loss of RO (2 horses), fracture/defect of the RO (2 horses), displaced/shifted RO (1 horse), and incomplete seal of the PPOC (2 horses). All complications were resolved by repairing or replacing the RO. The RO placement is a successful, noninvasive, easily repeatable treatment for PPOC. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: Sinusitis is a common disease of horses yet there are a limited number of reports in the literature that describe the prevalence of infraorbital canal (IOC) pathology and headshaking behaviour in horses diagnosed specifically with primary sinusitis and secondary dental sinusitis. Given the impact that these behaviours can have on horses' intended athletic use, investigation is warranted. Objectives: To determine the occurrence of IOC pathology in horses with concurrent primary or secondary dental sinusitis based on computed tomography (CT) findings and to assess whether the frequency of headshaking behaviour is influenced by the presence of IOC pathology. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Computed tomography studies were assessed for sinusitis (unilateral or bilateral), IOC pathology (unilateral or bilateral) and description of IOC disease including displacement, deformation, periosteal proliferation, hyperostosis, osteolysis and infraorbital nerve exposure. Behaviour outcome was determined by client questionnaire five or more years following CT scan. Results: A total 65 out of 66 horses diagnosed with primary or secondary dental sinusitis demonstrated IOC changes on CT. Hyperostosis (86%), periosteal proliferation (85%) and osteolysis (86%) were common CT findings. Hyperostosis was frequently found to involve both the IOC and supporting bone structure. Five cases were euthanized immediately after CT acquisition or during hospitalisation following diagnostic investigations. Follow-up was obtained in 48/61 cases, with five horses showing headshaking behaviour. Main limitations: Infraorbital nerve histopathology was not performed. The limited number of cases with no IOC pathology prevented direct comparison between sinusitis groups both with IOC pathology and without IOC changes. The client questionnaire carries a memory bias. Conclusion: Computed tomography changes involving the IOC may not predict headshaking behaviours in sinusitis secondary to dental disease. This finding is important in the context that these behaviours render some horses unusable and unsafe for their intended riding discipline. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This systematic review aimed to identify the evidence concerning the analgesic efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat abdominal pain in horses, and to establish whether one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug could provide better analgesia compared to others. This systematic review was conducted following the “Systematic Review Protocol for Animal Intervention Studies”. Research published between 1985 and the end of May 2023 was searched, using three databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, using the words equine OR horse AND colic OR abdominal pain AND non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug AND meloxicam OR flunixin meglumine OR phenylbutazone OR firocoxib OR ketoprofen. Risk of bias was assessed with the SYRCLE risk of bias tool, and level of evidence scored according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. From those only one study judged pain with a validated pain score, and a high risk of bias was identified due to the presence of selection, performance, and “other” types of bias. Therefore, caution is required in the interpretation of results from individual studies. To date, the evidence on analgesic efficacy to determine whether one drug is more potent than another regarding the treatment of abdominal pain in horses is sparse. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Some horses increase in forelimb lameness, measured as vertical head height asymmetry, or differences in maximums and minimums of head heights (HDmax, HDmin), after a palmar digital nerve (PDN) block. The prevalence of this finding, or what it means clinically, has not been reported in peer-reviewed literature. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of increasing head height asymmetry after a PDN block and determine if this is associated with cause of forelimb lameness. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Head height asymmetry, normalised to expected vertical head displacement, from inertial-sensor data collections of all horses evaluated for forelimb lameness while trotting in a straight line at two different clinics were screened for cases that had an initial PDN block and then another more proximal block in the same limb during the same lameness evaluation. Medical records of the screened cases (n = 213) were evaluated to determine the cause of lameness. Prevalence of increasing head height asymmetry was calculated. Differences in lameness amplitude between groups of cases that remained unchanged (Group 1), that increased (Group 2), and that decreased (Group 3) in head height asymmetry before and after the initial PDN block were compared (Kruskal-Wallis). Determination of the location of the cause of lameness and final diagnoses of cases were compared between Group 1 and Group 2 (chi-squared tests of independence). Results: The PDN block increased head height asymmetry at a prevalence of 32.5% (95% CI = 24.5%–41.5%) and 13.8% (95% CI = 7.3%–22.9%), in clinic 1 and 2, respectively. Increasing head height asymmetry after an initial PDN block did not predict localization of the cause of forelimb lameness or specific diagnosis (p = 0.1), other than indicating that it is unlikely to be in the foot (p = 0.02). Main limitations: Study samples consisted primarily of Warmbloods (clinic 1) and Quarter Horses (clinic 2). Analysis of blocking induced changes was limited to straight line trot only. Conclusions: Increasing head height asymmetry after PDN block is common during forelimb lameness evaluations. Other than indicating that the cause of lameness is more proximal in the blocked forelimb, this does not help determine the final diagnosis. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Although the chemo- and immuno-therapies have obtained good responses for several solid tumors, including those with brain metastasis, their clinical efficacy in glioblastoma (GBM) is disappointing. The lack of safe and effective delivery systems across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are two main hurdles for GBM therapy. Herein, a Trojan-horse-like nanoparticle system is designed, which encapsulates biocompatible PLGA-coated temozolomide (TMZ) and IL-15 nanoparticles (NPs) with cRGD-decorated NK cell membrane (R-NKm@NP), to elicit the immunostimulatory TME for GBM chemo-immunotherapy. Taking advantage of the outer NK cell membrane cooperating with cRGD, the R-NKm@NPs effectively traversed across the BBB and targeted GBM. In addition, the R-NKm@NPs exhibited good antitumor ability and prolonged the median survival of GBM-bearing mice. Notably, after R-NKm@NPs treatment, the locally released TMZ and IL-15 synergistically stimulated the proliferation and activation of NK cells, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, eliciting an immunostimulatory TME. Lastly, the R-NKm@NPs not only effectively prolonged the metabolic cycling time of the drugs in vivo, but also has no noticeable side effects. This study may offer valuable insights for developing biomimetic nanoparticles to potentiate GBM chemo- and immuno-therapies in the future. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Background: Musculoskeletal injuries are observed in Thoroughbred racehorses and may become catastrophic. Currently, there are limited methods for early detection of such injuries. Most injuries develop gradually due to accumulated damage, providing the opportunity for early detection. Horses experiencing pain or lameness may exhibit changes in behaviour so the development of an objective, real-time system monitoring horse behaviour may enable detection of bone injuries before catastrophic failure. Objectives: To determine whether intensive observational methods of assessing horse behaviour can be replaced by use of inertial measurement units (IMUs). Study design: Validation study assessing IMU use against video observation. Methods: Six hospitalised Thoroughbreds (algorithm training data) and 19 Thoroughbred racehorses in-training (algorithm testing data) were equipped with an IMU placed on the lateral side of both forelimbs (left fore, LF; right fore, RF) and monitored in a stable for 4 h. An algorithm was developed to classify behaviour and then validated against video recordings. Results: Standing was the most prevalent behaviour (LF 88.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 88.7–89.0; RF 88.5%, 95% CI 88.4–88.7). IMU classification of recumbent and standing activities showed excellent agreement (sensitivity) with video observation (>98%). This was followed by stepping (LF 89.4%, RF 85.5%) then weight-shifting (LF 54.3%, RF 61.5%). Predictions from the algorithm showed misclassification of 2.5% (LF 5500/225 352, RF 5218/210 170). Excluding standing, misclassification was 6.8% (1705/25 158) and 7.5% (1812/24 077) for the left and right forelimbs, respectively, with pawing and weight-shifting most frequently misclassified. Main limitations: Increasing the number of horses and types of behaviours observed may improve predictions. Conclusions: IMUs displayed a high sensitivity to movement on a small number of horses, and with further validation they have the potential to effectively monitor behaviour of racehorses in training. However, more sensitive methods may be needed to validate the classification of weight-shifting behaviour. Future studies should evaluate the association between each behaviour and musculoskeletal injury. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine herpesvirus-5 (EHV-5) is commonly found in healthy asymptomatic horses worldwide. Although a cause-and-effect relationship has not been thoroughly determined, this virus has been associated with several disease conditions including equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) and 1 case of interface dermatitis. The authors searched the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Center database for cases of equine interface dermatitis between 2007 and 2022. Ten cases were identified and scrutinized for viral inclusion bodies which were present in 5 of 10 cases. Two similar cases with interface dermatitis and viral inclusion bodies, which were not part of a retrospective search, were from the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The authors describe a total of 7 horses with dermatitis characterized by crusted, alopecic, non-pruritic, non-painful, irregular to annular areas over the face, most commonly the muzzle, for up to several years duration. Histologically, there was a CD3+ T lymphocyte-dominated lymphohistiocytic interface dermatitis with hydropic degeneration, apoptotic keratinocytes, and pigmentary incontinence. Keratinocytes within the upper stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum had glassy pale basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies consistent with herpesvirus. The presence of EHV-5 was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and in situ hybridization in 7 horses and by electron microscopy in 1 horse. One horse later developed EMPF and was euthanized. EHV-5 was not detected with qPCR from 5 control horses and 5 horses with interface dermatitis without histologic evidence of viral inclusion bodies. These are the first cases of facial interface dermatitis associated with EHV-5 reported in the United States. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Piroplasmosis and trypanosomiasis are debilitating diseases of great economic impact on the equine industry of Latin America. Considering the lack of studies in the northeastern part of Colombia, this study aimed to determine the epidemiological, clinical and genetic features associated with infection of the Babesia, Theileria, and Trypanosoma species in horses from this geographical area. Two hundred and eighty horses from the Arauca, Meta, and Santander departments were molecularly analyzed for infection with Babesia caballi, Theileria equi, Trypanosoma evansi, and Trypanosoma vivax. Furthermore, clinical, epidemiological and entomological analyses were performed on the data sets. Molecular analysis showed 25.7% and 3.9% prevalence for T. equi and T. evansi, respectively, without positive animals for B. caballi and T. vivax. There were no differences in the prevalence of T. equi between departments, whereas T. evansi was detected exclusively in Santander. A total of 633 ticks were collected from 72 horses across the three departments, with 84.7% corresponding to Dermacentor nitens, 10.9% to Amblyomma cajennense (sensu lato) (s.l). and 4.4% to Rhipicephalus microplus. For T. equi, genetic analyses showed that Colombian isolates belong to genotype C of species, along with sequences of Brazil and Mexico. Epidemiological analysis revealed a significant association between tick infestation and lack of vector control with molecular infection of T. equi, whereas clinical analysis revealed a significant reduction in packed cell volume, red blood cells, and mean corpuscular volume in positive animals to this pathogen. Furthermore, molecular infection by T. evansi was associated with epidemiological characteristics in the Santander department. In conclusion, our analysis revealed a moderate infection rate by T. equi of genotype C in horses from northeastern Colombia, which affects their clinical conditions. Control of ticks and treatment of symptomatic animals should be considered to reduce the economic impact associated with these infections in the equine industry. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Equine back function is of concern to riders, as well as to veterinarians and physiotherapists; these groups may benefit from knowledge about spinal motion on the circle. This descriptive and comparative study aimed to quantify equine neck, back and pelvic motion in walk, trot and canter on a 9 m circle. Sixteen healthy horses in training, of varying breed and conformation, were measured using optical motion capture (150 Hz), with optical markers on the poll, withers, T15, tubera coxae and lumbosacral joint. Cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar flexion–extension and lateral bending, and pelvic roll, pitch and yaw, were statistically evaluated using mixed models. Motion patterns showed distinct differences between gaits, but were generally similar between horses. The thoracolumbar back was bent towards the inside of the circle (stride mean 5-6º for all gaits). The cervicothoracic spine was more flexed in walk (18°), and more extended in canter (-4—-8°), compared to trot (6–7°), whereas the thoracolumbar spine was slightly less extended in canter than in walk. Thoracolumbar flexion–extension range of motion (ROM) increased from walk (4°) to canter (9°), as did pelvic pitch ROM (walk 7° and canter 15–16°), while back lateral bending ROM and pelvic yaw ROM were lowest in trot. Taken together, the study findings suggest that neck and back motion patterns on the circle reflect an interaction between the constraints of circular movement, and the mechanics and characteristics of each gait. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: White spotting is an iconic feature of the American Paint Horse. The American Paint Horse Association (APHA) is dedicated to recording pedigree and performance of this stock-type breed, while preserving its distinctive coat color and conformation. Here, the depigmented proportion of the coat (% white coat) was measured using digital photograph analysis of 1195 registered American Paint Horses. Genotypes for nine white-spotting polymorphisms commonly found in Paint Horses, and two pigment-producing loci MCIR and ASIP genes, were also provided by the APHA. White-coat percent significantly increased in horses with more white-spotting alleles present, regardless of the number of loci bearing those alleles, likely due to a strong additive genetic effect at each white-spotting locus, as well as an additive epistatic effect among white spotting loci. Paint Horses with a chestnut base coat color (genotype e/e at MC1R) possessed a significantly higher white coat percentage, suggesting confirming an epistatic interaction between pigmentation signaling genes and loci for white spotting. The APHA registry categories of Regular versus Solid Paint-Bred also differed in their median white coat percentage (p < 0.0001), but not in the overall ranges of this phenotype, reenforcing the importance of the regional patterns of the depigmentation in the definition of the desired APHA phenotype. Multi-locus phenotype prediction models for white-coat percentage performed only moderately well, and improvements in the sample size and the number of loci genotyped will likely be needed before such an approach could be used practically by APHA breeders. In the future, models that enable phenotype prediction based on genotypes, and automated phenotype assessment could increase the production of valuable visual traits in the American Paint Horse population and improve the APHA member experience during the registration process. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe cases with caudal cruciate ligament (CdCL) avulsion fragments diagnosed based on computed tomography (CT) examination and report on arthroscopic fragment removal. Animals: Four Warmblood horses with hindlimb lameness and osseous fragments located in the caudal medial femorotibial joint (mFTJ). Study design: Short case series. Methods: CT and arthroscopic evaluation of the caudal mFTJ were performed. The caudal mFTJ and the insertion of the CdCL on the tibia were assessed and removal of the avulsion fragments was attempted in three horses using a cranial intercondylar approach. Results: The fragment was not accessible via caudomedial approaches in one horse. A cranial intercondylar approach was used in three horses, allowing removal of the intra-articular fragment in two horses, and removal of two-thirds of the proximal fragment in the last horse. Acute, profuse, arterial bleeding occurred in this horse during surgery with transient postoperative soft tissue swelling. Comorbidities included medial femoral condyle cartilage defects (3), cranial cruciate ligament lesions (2), and medial collateral ligament lesions (2). Horses were followed up for 16 months (median, range 11–28 months), at which point all were back in ridden exercise; owners' satisfaction was good. Conclusion: CT examination confirmed the diagnosis and allowed evaluation of the stifle joint for comorbidities. A cranial intercondylar arthroscopic approach facilitated the removal of CdCL insertional avulsion fragments, although not always complete. Clinical significance: A cranial intercondylar approach can allow access to CdCL avulsion fragments, but complications and incomplete removal remain possible. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: With the advent of genomics, significant progress has been made in the genetic improvement of livestock species, particularly through increased accuracy in predicting breeding values for selecting superior animals and the possibility of performing a high-resolution genetic scan throughout the genome of an individual. The main objectives of this study were to estimate the individual genomic inbreeding coefficient based on runs of homozygosity (FROH), to identify and characterize runs of homozygosity and heterozygosity (ROH and ROHet, respectively; length and distribution) throughout the genome, and to map selection signatures in relevant chromosomal regions in the Quarter Horse racing line. A total of 336 animals registered with the Brazilian Association of Quarter Horse Breeders (ABQM) were genotyped. One hundred and twelve animals were genotyped using the Equine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina, USA), with 54,602 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 54K). The remaining 224 samples were genotyped using the Equine SNP70 BeadChip (Illumina, USA) with 65,157 SNPs (65K). To ensure data quality, we excluded animals with a call rate below 0.9. We also excluded SNPs located on non-autosomal chromosomes, as well as those with a call rate below 0.9 or a p-value below 1 × 10−5 for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The results indicate moderate to high genomic inbreeding, with 46,594 ROH and 16,101 ROHet detected. In total, 30 and 14 candidate genes overlap with ROH and ROHet regions, respectively. The ROH islands showed genes linked to crucial biological processes, such as cell differentiation (CTBP1, WNT5B, and TMEM120B), regulation of glucose metabolic process (MAEA and NKX1-1), heme transport (PGRMC2), and negative regulation of calcium ion import (VDAC1). In ROHet, the islands showed genes related to respiratory capacity (OR7D19, OR7D4G, OR7D4E, and OR7D4J) and muscle repair (EGFR and BCL9). These findings could aid in selecting animals with greater regenerative capacity and developing treatments for muscle disorders in the QH breed. This study serves as a foundation for future research on equine breeds. It can contribute to developing reproductive strategies in animal breeding programs to improve and preserve the Quarter Horse breed. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Decreasing hyperinsulinemia is crucial in preventing laminitis in insulin dysregulated (ID) horses. Complementary pharmacological treatments that efficiently decrease postprandial hyperinsulinemia in ID horses are needed. Objectives: Compare short-term effects of canagliflozin vs placebo on glucose and insulin responses to an oral sugar test (OST) as well as the effects on body weight and triglyceride concentrations in horses with ID. Animals: Sixteen privately-owned ID horses. Methods: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study. The horses were randomized (ratio 1:1) to either once daily PO treatment with 0.6 mg/kg canagliflozin or placebo. The study consisted of an initial 3-day period for obtaining baseline data, a 3-week double-blind treatment period at home, and a 3-day follow-up period similar to the initial baseline period but with continued double-blind treatment. Horses were subjected to an 8-sample OST in the morning of the third day on both visits. Results: Maximal geometric least square (LS) mean insulin concentration (95% confidence interval [CI]) during the OST decreased after 3 weeks of canagliflozin treatment compared with placebo (83.2; 55.4-125.0 vs 215.2; 143.2-323.2 μIU/mL). The geometric LS mean insulin response (insulin AUC0-180) for canagliflozin-treated horses was >66% lower compared with placebo. Least square mean body weight decreased by 11.1 (4-18.1) kg and LS mean triglyceride concentrations increased by 0.99 (0.47-1.5) mmol/L with canagliflozin treatment. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Canagliflozin is a promising drug for treatment of ID horses that requires future studies. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: RNA sequencing makes it possible to uncover genetic mechanisms that underlie certain performance traits. In order to gain a deeper insight into the genetic background and biological processes involved in endurance performance in horses, the changes in the gene expression profiles induced by endurance runs over long (70 km) and short (15 km) distances in the blood of Kabardian horses (Equus caballus) were analyzed. For the long-distance runs, we identified 1484 up- and 691 downregulated genes, while after short-distance runs, only 13 up- and 8 downregulated genes (FC > |1.5|; p < 0.05) were found. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are involved in processes and pathways that are primarily related to stress response (interleukin production, activation of inflammatory system) but also to metabolism (carbohydrate catabolic process, lipid biosynthesis, NADP metabolic process). The most important genes involved in these processes therefore represent good candidates for the monitoring and evaluation of the performance of horses in order to avoid excessive demands when endurance performance is required, like ACOD1, CCL5, CD40LG, FOS, IL1R2, IL20RA, and IL22RA2, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, for assessing the suitability of a horse for endurance races, like GATA2, GYG1, HIF1A, MOGAT1, PFKFB3, PLIN5, SIK1, and STBD1. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe the surgical treatment, postoperative management, and outcome of a miniature horse undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Study design: Case report. Animals: A 4-year-old miniature horse stallion weighing 85 kg. Methods: The horse presented with left coxofemoral luxation of ~6 weeks duration. Computed tomography confirmed craniodorsal luxation with marked degenerative changes to the femoral head. The horse underwent THA using cementless press fit implants, including an interlocking lateral bolt for the femoral stem. Results: The horse recovered well from anesthesia but suffered a coma-like episode after returning to a stable. Following treatment of presumed hypovolemia, the horse regained normal mentation and was discharged 24 days after surgery. At reassessment 12 weeks postoperatively, the horse was 2/10 left hind limb lameness at trot with good healing of the surgery site. Five months postoperatively mild (1/10) lameness remained at trot but the horse was able to canter normally on both reins. The horse has since been managed normally with no veterinary treatment required for 32 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Total hip arthroplasty is possible in miniature horses weighing up to 85 kg and can result in a good long-term outcome. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We determined reference intervals (RIs) for concentrations of trace minerals and toxic elements based on liver samples from 122 apparently healthy horses at 2 slaughter facilities in the Netherlands. Samples were collected during the spring and fall of 2021, and the sex and age of the horses were registered upon sampling. Concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, vanadium, and zinc were measured in liver samples using inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after nitric acid digestion. RIs were calculated using Reference Value Advisor software. The concentrations of most elements were not significantly different between sexes or in different seasons. Cadmium concentrations were higher than the European maximum residue limit of 2 mg/kg DW in 89% of livers. Positive significant correlations were observed between some elements (iron, molybdenum, lead, vanadium), and significant negative correlations between others (manganese, iron). © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Calcium dobesilate (CD) is a synthetic venoactive drug used in veterinary medicine to treat equine navicular disease. Etamsylate is a haemostatic agent used in horses for the treatment of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage. Both etamsylate and CD dissociate in the circulatory system with 2,5-HBSA as the active drug. The aim of the research was to be able to provide detection time (DT) advice from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in Thoroughbred horses to better inform trainers, and their veterinary surgeons, prescribing these substances for treatment of Thoroughbred racehorses. Two (pilot study) and six (final study) horses were given 28 and 9 repeated dose of CD (3 mg/kg BID) respectively. Two horses were each given a single intravenous (IV) dose of etamsylate (10 mg/kg). Plasma and urine 2,5-HBSA concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The CD pilot study revealed that steady state could be reached with a few days and that 2,5-HBSA in plasma and urine shows instability during storage at −20°C but appears stable at −80°C. A novel holistic non-linear mixed-effects three-compartmental PK model was developed that described both plasma and urine concentrations of 2,5-HBSA, from either CD or etamsylate administration. Typical values for 2,5-HBSA clearance and bioavailability were 2.0 mL/min/kg and 28% respectively. Using the parameters obtained from this PK model, in conjunction with methodology developed by Toutain, afforded a possible screening limit (SL) that can regulate for a DT of 3 days in urine; however, a corresponding SL in plasma would be below current levels of detection. However, it is the responsibility of the individual racing authorities to apply their own risk management with regard to SLs and DTs. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ulcerative bacterial keratitis can result in loss of vision or the eye. Antimicrobial susceptibility data are essential in selecting optimal therapy while pending culture results. Objectives: To document aerobic bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibilities from horses with ulcerative keratitis and report susceptibility patterns compared to previously described data from the same hospital. Study design: Retrospective clinical case series. Methods: Medical records from horses with positive bacterial cultures and a clinical diagnosis of infectious ulcerative keratitis at the University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center between March 2011 and December 2020 were reviewed and compared to previously published data from January 1993 to May 2004. Results: Thirty-one bacterial isolates were cultured from 27 samples (26 horses). The most common bacterial genera were Streptococcus (35%), Staphylococcus (29%) and Pseudomonas (13%), with a shift towards more Staphylococcus and less Streptococcus compared to previous years. There were minimal temporal changes in susceptibilities for these three genera. Staphylococcus spp. were statistically more likely to be cultured than other bacteria after the use of topical neomycin-polymyxinB-dexamethasone (p = 0.008). In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility results suggest that targeted combination therapy covered a greater percentage of isolates, compared with monotherapy, but in vitro results may not mirror in vivo results. Main limitations: Inconsistencies in available medical data, selection bias and a small sample size are inherent limitations in this retrospective study, along with the inability to test against all available ophthalmic medications, challenges of interpreting cultures with limited veterinary susceptibility data and no susceptibility guidelines for topical medications. Conclusion: Limited changes have occurred over the past several decades in corneal bacterial isolates and susceptibilities within this equine ophthalmology referral population, with a shift in more Staphylococcus cultured over time. Monitoring temporal trends of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility data is important in every hospital. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The long history of Arabian horse breeding in Croatia spans several centuries and was strongly influenced by the breeding of Arabian horses in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thus, the modern breeding of the Croatian Arabian horse is closely connected with the horse breeding of the Borike Stud, founded in 1895 in the mountainous region of Bosnia. Our main goal was to study the specifics of the Croatian Arabian horse (ARABCRO), the influence of the “Borike” breeding and the possible influence of other horse breeds. Therefore, we analyzed the population structure and admixture of the ARABCRO population (62 horses) together with 538 horses of Arabian and other origin (530 publicly available genotypes and 8 newly genotyped Shagya horses from Croatia) using high-throughput genomic data (GeneSeek® Genomic Profiler™ Equine SNP BeadChip 70 K). Our analyses (PCA, Neighbour Network, FST and STRUCTURE) revealed that ARABCRO is genetically closely related to the other Arabian horse breeds (populations) with an average FST of 0.09 whereas (the FST between ARABCRO and the Kladrub, Lipizzaner or Thoroughbred breeds, for example, is over 0.14) and thus can be considered a member of a large “Arabian horse metapopulation” (ARABMETA). At the same time, we have shown that ARABCRO is a distinct population with a specific position within ARABMETA, which can be quantified by genomic analyses. We also estimated the conservation status of ARABCRO, i.e., genomic inbreeding level (FROH) and effective population size (Ne) given the small census size of the breed (428 horses in 2021). Estimated genomic inbreeding levels were high (FROH>2Mb = 0.136, FROH>4Mb = 0.100), especially those estimated for recent inbreeding (FROH>8Mb = 0.071 and FROH>16Mb = 0.039), indicating intentional mating practices of very close relatives. The estimated effective population size was small, ranging from Ne = 47 to Ne = 67 (95% CI) and was significantly reduced from Ne = 500 (approximately) from 9 to 12 generations back (generation interval about 10 years). The obtained results will be used in further breeding of ARABCRO, especially with regard to the current conservation status, e.g. by controlled mating and “blood refreshment” with other Arabian horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: It is generally assumed that parents make a genetically equal contribution to their offspring, but this assumption might not always hold. This is because the expression of a gene can be blocked by methylation during gametogenesis, and the degree of methylation can depend on the origin of the parental gene (imprinting) or by preferential management associated with genetic merit. The first consequences of this for quantitative genetics is that the mean phenotypes of reciprocal heterozygotes need no longer be the same, as would be expected according to Mendelian heritage. We analysed three mare reproductive traits (reproductive efficiency, age at first foaling and foaling number) and three morphological traits (height at withers, thoracic circumference, and scapula-ischial length) in the Pura Raza Española (PRE) horse population, which possesses a deep and reliable pedigree, making it a perfect breed for analysing the quantitative effect of parent-of-origin. The number of animals analysed ranged from 44,038 to 144,191, all of them with both parents known. The model comparison between a model without parent-of-origin effects and three different models with parent-of-origin effects revealed that both maternal and paternal gametic effects influence all the analysed traits. The maternal gametic effect had a higher influence on most traits, accounting for between 3% and 11% of the total phenotypic variance, while the paternal gametic effect accounted for a higher proportion of variance in one trait, age at first foaling (4%). As expected, the Pearson's correlations between additive breeding values of models that consider parent-of-origin and that do not consider parent-of-origin were very high; however, the percentage of coincident animals slightly decreases when comparing animals with the highest estimated breeding values. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that parent-of-origin effects exist in horse gene transmission from a quantitative point of view. Additionally, including an estimate of the parent-of-origin effect within the PRE horse breeding program could be a great tool for a better parent's selection and that could be of interest for breeders, as this value will determine whether the animals acquire genetic categories and are much more highly valued. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Due to the importance of joint disease and ostearthritis (OA) in equine athletes, new regenerative treatments to improve articular cartilage repair after damage are gaining relevance. Chondrocyte de-differentiation, an important pathogenetic mechanism in OA, is a limiting factor when differentiated articular chondrocytes are used for cell-based therapies. Current research focuses on the prevention of this de-differentiation and/or on the re-differentiation of chondrocytes by employing different strategies in vitro and in vivo. Articular chondrocytes normally live in a condition of higher osmolarity (350–450 mOsm/L) compared to normal physiological fluids (~ 300 mOsm/L) and some studies have demonstrated that osmolarity has a chondroprotective effect in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the response of horse articular chondrocytes to osmolarity changes (280, 380, and 480 mOsm/L) was studied both in proliferating, de-differentiated chondrocytes grown in adhesion, and in differentiated chondrocytes grown in a 3D culture system. To this aim, cell proliferation (cell counting), morphology (optical microscopy), and differentiation (gene expression of specific markers) were monitored along with the expression of osmolyte transporters involved in volume regulation [betaine-GABA transporter (BGT-1), taurine transporter (SLC6A6), and neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT)] real-time qPCR. Proliferating chondrocytes cultured under hyperosmolar conditions showed low proliferation, spheroidal morphology, a significant reduction of de-differentiation markers [collagen type I (Col1) and RUNX2] and an increase of differentiation markers [collagen type II (Col2) and aggrecan]. Notably, a persistently high level of BGT-1 gene expression was maintained in chondrocyte cultures at 380 mOsm/L, and particularly at 480 mOsm/L both in proliferating and differentiated chondrocytes. These preliminary data encourage the study of osmolarity as a microenvironmental co-factor to promote/maintain chondrocyte differentiation in both 2D and 3D in vitro culture systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine obesity is a significant health and welfare concern. The proportion of domestic horse populations that are overweight are as high as 45%. As the primary decision-makers for their horses’ care, owners are theoretically ideally placed to identify whether their horses are appropriately conditioned, however, research in other countries has shown that many owners are unable to accurately judge their horse’s body condition. In this study, through the comparison of body condition scoring (BCS) performed by an expert and the horse owners and interviews with owners, we aimed to identify the proportion of horses that were overweight or obese, to assess the accuracy of horse owners' BCS assessment both prior to and after receiving information and instructions on body condition scoring, and to identify common themes amongst owners’ views regarding BCS assessment and the Henneke BCS system. Results: Forty-five percent of the horses in this study were overweight or obese. The agreement between the owners and an equine veterinarian regarding the horses’ BCS was fair to good both prior to (κ =.311, P < 0.001; ICC =.502, P < 0.001) and after (κ =.381, P < 0.001; ICC =.561, P < 0.001) receiving information and instructions on scoring. Three quarters of the owners who took part in the study did not use any method of monitoring their horse’s body condition. Thematic analysis of owner responses was varied, with the most common theme being an awareness of the need to monitor or make changes to their horse’s condition with responses in this theme split between owners who felt in control and those who did not. Owner feedback on the utility and useability of the scorning system was that it was useful however parts are too technical or need improvement. Conclusions: Equine obesity is a significant problem in this population in Ireland. Horse owners’ ability to accurately judge their horse’s condition does not improve with provision of instructions on body condition scoring. These results combined with owners’ feedback on the Henneke BCS system indicate that it is not a tool that can be reliably used by owners. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Equine rhinitis B virus is a lesser-known equine respiratory pathogen that is being detected with increasing frequency via a voluntary upper respiratory biosurveillance program in the United States. This program received 8684 nasal swab submissions during the years 2012–2023. The nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR testing for six common upper respiratory pathogens: Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi), equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4), equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), and equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV). The overall ERBV qPCR-positivity rate was 5.08% (441/8684). ERBV was detected as a single pathogen in 291 cases (65.99% of positives, 291/441) and was detected as a coinfection with at least one other respiratory pathogen in 150 cases (34.01%, 150/441). Young horses, less than a year of age, with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs and horses used for competition are more likely to test qPCR-positive for ERBV. Horses with ERBV may present with fever, nasal discharge, ocular discharge, and/or cough. Coinfection is a common feature of ERBV infection and S. equi, EHV-4 and EIV were the most common pathogens coinfected with ERBV. This report provides important information regarding the clinical relevance of ERBV in the horse and begins investigating the impact of coinfection on clinical disease. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Fasciola hepatica is a trematode parasite that affects wide range of mammalian hosts including horses. There are no epidemiological data on fasciolosis in Egyptian horses. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of F. hepatica in horses using ELISA as well as assess the associated risk factors for fasciolosis infection. A total of 400 sera samples of horses from three Egyptian governorates were examined. The overall seroprevalence rate in horses was 13% and the disease was more prevalent in Qalubia (14.17%) and Gharbia (16.67%) which are located at Nile Delta. The likelihood of having F. hepatica seropositivity was higher in mixed-breed animals and stallions (OR = 3.97, 95%CI: 1.10–14.28 and OR = 2.07, 95%CI: 1.09–3.93, respectively), and in older horses more than 10 years (OR = 5.69, 95% CI: 1.98–16.36). Horses were more likely to be seropositive with F. hepatica when kept in outdoor housing (OR= 1.53, 95%CI: 0.78–3), during autumn (OR = 3.80, 95%CI: 1.17–12.32) and in the presence of snails (OR = 2.72, 95%CI: 1.34–5.52). Therefore, the obtained data contributes to the understanding of the epidemiology of Fasciola species, assess in establishment of management programmes to reduce disease and public health risks. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this research was to determine the influence of horse feed on selected nutritionally important components of mare's milk with a focus on fat content: total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), stearic fatty acid, n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA, linoleic (LA) and α-linolenic (ALA) fatty acids. Also, the chemical parameters of the fatty acid composition of feed for horses (briquettes and meadow hay) were examined. Research results showed that complete feed contains a higher crude protein and fat content than hay. In addition, there was a difference in the composition of fatty acids in the milk of mares fed meadow hay compared to briquettes. Accordingly, the diet of mares has an influence on the chemical and fatty acid composition of milk, but it is not the only factor that has an influence. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The purpose of our work was to conduct a survey of the horse population for the presence of parasites of the gastrointestinal tract in Moscow and the Moscow region. The research included horses aged 1.5 months to 26 years from horse farms and from private owners too. Fecal samples were collected rectally from 571 horses and were examined on the day of collection by flotation method and sedimentation method. Horses are infected with parasites of the gastrointestinal tract by 47.5% in the Moscow region. The main representatives of the parasite fauna are nematodes. Strongylidae gen. sp. (44%), Parascaris sp. (10.3%), Oxyuris equi (1.4%), Eimeria leuckarti (0.5%) were found. Statistically revealed correlations between the level of infection and the age of the horse (p < 0.001), as well as between the level of infection and the conditions of keeping (p < 0.001). The most infected were horses in the age group from 1 to 3 years. According to the study, herd horses are significantly more likely to be infected with Parascaris sp. and O. equi. No correlation was found between the level of infection and the type of farming (horse farms or private owners) (p = 0.252). © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: A high prevalence of both squamous (ESGD) and glandular (EGGD) ulcers was previously found in, mainly young, Icelandic horses coming into training for the first time. This study evaluated risk factors for gastric ulcers in Icelandic riding horses at various ages and stages of training. The horses (n = 211) were gastroscoped from 21 equine establishments across Iceland. A variety of morphometric, clinical, behavioural and management factors were evaluated as potential risk factors for gastroscopically significant (grade ≥ 2/4: found in 27% of horses) or gastroscopically severe (grade 3 or 4/4: found in ~10% of horses) ESGD or gastroscopically significant EGGD (grade ≥ 1/2: found in 46.4%). Body condition score (BCS), cresty neck score (CNS), stable/turnout behaviour, exercise intensity/frequency and age were not significantly associated with ESGD or EGGD ulcer score. However, having come off the pasture into training for 4 weeks or less was a significant risk factor for gastroscopically significant and severe ESGD compared to 5 weeks or more. For both EGGD and ESGD, “region” was important. Gastroscopically significant EGGD and gastroscopically severe ESGD were more prevalent in those showing clinical signs often associated with ulcers. Geldings were more likely to have gastroscopically significant ESGD than both mares and stallions and more EGGD than stallions. Being stabled, but spending >2 h/day out in the paddock, compared with <2 h paddock time or full-time turnout, was protective for gastroscopically significant ESGD as was being fed complementary feed (all fed <1 g non-structural carbohydrate (NSC)/kg/BW/meal). Being at a training establishment for >4 weeks was protective for gastroscopically significant and gastroscopically severe ESGD but not EGGD. This study confirms the relatively low prevalence of ESGD in Icelandic horses being kept in training establishments and fed low NSC diets but highlights the high prevalence of EGGD. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine practitioners require recommendations that support antimicrobial stewardship and avoid generating resistance to medically important antibiotics. This review examines current inadequacies in antimicrobial stewardship standards within the veterinary community, related to antimicrobial categorisation and prescribing practices. Resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics in horses is also described. Properties of cephalosporin antibiotics are outlined and equine-specific studies of ceftiofur, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with medical importance, are detailed. Readers are provided with recommendations that encourage appropriate use of ceftiofur, citing the evidence available in horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This case series describes the management of advanced occlusal caries of the maxillary cheek teeth in four horses. All horses presented with grade 4 caries, i.e., affecting cementum, enamel, dentine and the integrity of the tooth. Food packing in deep cavities on the occlusal surface were present in all horses. Two horses presented with pulpitis of teeth adjacent to the occlusal caries lesions. The carious lesions were mostly limited to the occlusal surface of maxillary cheek teeth, whereas the peripheral cementum to a large degree remained unaffected. Management of these cases included cleaning, flushing, and debriding of carious surfaces and placing a flowable resin composite on areas with extensive tooth loss to prevent food packing and further destruction of dental tissues. Endodontic therapy was performed in two cases. Some of the horses that exhibited clinical signs showed improvement after treatment and none of the cases showed deterioration of caries lesions. One horse showed complete resolution of occlusal caries. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The improvement of horse welfare through housing conditions has become a real issue in recent years and have highlighted the detrimental effect of individual housing of horses on their health and behaviour. In this new study, we analysed the blood transcriptome of 45 sport horses housed individually that were previously examined for their behaviour and gut microbiota. We performed differential and regression analyses of gene expression, followed by downstream bioinformatic analyses, to unveil the molecular pathways related to the behavioural changes associated with welfare impairment in these sport horses. We found that aggressiveness towards humans was the behavioural indicator the most correlated to blood gene expression and that the pathways involved belonged mainly to systemic inflammation. In contrast, the correlations between genes, alert postures and unresponsiveness towards the environment were weak. When blood gene expression profiling was combined with faecal microbiota of a sub-population of horses, stereotypies came out as the most correlated to blood gene expression. This study shows that aggressiveness towards humans and stereotypies are behavioural indicators that covary with physiological alterations. Further studies are needed regarding the biological correlates of unresponsiveness to the environment and alert postures. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Recognition of antimicrobial resistance in equine practice has increased over the past decade. The objective of this study was to provide an updated retrospective review of antimicrobial regimens in one tertiary referral hospital and to evaluate the association with postoperative complications. A secondary objective was to evaluate other perioperative factors including surgical procedure, anesthetic and recovery parameters, and the effect of perioperative medications on complications and outcomes. A computerized search of medical records was performed to identify horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2021. A total of 742 celiotomies were performed (608 completed, 134 terminated intraoperatively). Factors recorded were evaluated using logistic regression for the presence of either incisional infection, postoperative ileus, or other complications postoperatively. Antimicrobial type or timing (pre-, intra-, or postoperative) were not associated with decreased risk of incisional infection or postoperative ileus; however, the duration of NSAID use was positively associated with incisional infection (OR 1.14 per day). Lidocaine and alpha-2-agonist administration postoperatively were also associated with increased incidence of postoperative ileus (OR 21.5 and 1.56, respectively). Poor recovery quality (OR 4.69), the addition of other antimicrobials besides penicillin/gentamicin postoperatively (OR 3.63), and an increased number of different NSAID classes used (OR 1.46 per additional) were associated with other complications. Implementation of enterotomy was associated with decreased risk of other complications (OR 0.64). These findings provide an updated summary of factors associated with postoperative complications in horses undergoing celiotomy. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Strain CBA3108T is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic bacterium isolated from horse faecal samples obtained in Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. The cells of CBA3108T are non-motile short rods that have been assessed as catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. Growth of the strain occurs under the following conditions: 25–45 °C (optimum, 35 °C); pH 6–9 (optimum, pH 6); and in the presence of 0–6 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2%). Major fatty acids in the strain include C15: 0 iso and C15: 0 iso DMA, while major polar lipids include phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. Based on phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain CBA3108T forms a phyletic lineage distinct from other closely related species within the genus Cutibacterium. It was found to be most closely related to Cutibacterium avidum ATCC 25577T (98.27 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and other strains within the genus (≤98.0 %). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CBA3108T was 63.2 mol%. The in silico DNA–DNA hybridization values of strain CBA3108T with C. avidum ATCC 25577T, C. porci WCA-380-WT-3AT and C. acnes subsp. acnes DSM 1897T were 33.6, 21.7 and 22.7 %, respectively. Its phenotypic, chemotax-onomic and molecular properties support the hypothesis that strain CBA3108T represents a novel species in the genus Cutibac-terium, for which we propose the name Cutibacterium equinum sp. nov. The type strain is CBA3108T (=KACC 22889T=JCM 35966T). © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are a type of membranous vesicles that can be released by cells into the extracellular space. The relationship between sEVs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is highly intricate and interdependent. This symbiotic relationship plays a pivotal role in facilitating intercellular communication and holds profound implications for a myriad of biological processes. The concept of sEVs and their ncRNA cargo as a “Trojan Horse” highlights their remarkable capacity to traverse biological barriers and surreptitiously deliver their cargo to target cells, evading detection by the host-immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that sEVs may be harnessed as carriers to ferry therapeutic ncRNAs capable of selectively silencing disease-driving genes, particularly in conditions such as cancer. This approach presents several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods, opening up new possibilities for targeted therapy and improved treatment outcomes. However, the utilization of sEVs and ncRNAs as therapeutic agents raises valid concerns regarding the possibility of unforeseen consequences and unintended impacts that may emerge from their application. It is important to consider the fundamental attributes of sEVs and ncRNAs, including by an in-depth analysis of the practical and clinical potentials of exosomes, serving as a representative model for sEVs encapsulating ncRNAs. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to determine the accumulation levels of arsenic in pasture soil, forage and animals. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentration of metals in the samples of soil, forage and blood plasma of horses. The level of arsenic ranged between 4.26 mg/kg (summer) and 4.66 mg/kg (winter) in soil samples and 2.67 mg/kg (summer) and 2.94 mg/kg (winter) in forage samples. In blood plasma samples, the mean arsenic (As) values varied between 1.38 and 1.52 mg/L. In the blood plasma samples, the mean As values varied between 1.38 and 1.52 mg/L. No statistically significant changes were observed for arsenic concentrations in plasma samples of horses for sampling seasons (p > 0.05). A positive correlation was observed for forage and blood plasma to a certain degree for arsenic but for other media, arsenic correlations were negative and insignificant. It is therefore suggested that regular monitoring of heavy metals in soils/plants/animals is essential to prevent excessive build-up of arsenic. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Transmission Ratio Distortion (TRD) is a genetic phenomenon widely demonstrated in several livestock species, but barely in equine species. The TRD occurs when certain genotypes are over- or under-represented in the offspring of a particular mating and can be caused by a variety of factors during gamete formation or during embryonic development. For this study, 126 394 trios consisting of a stallion, mare, and offspring were genotyped using a panel of 17 neutral microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics for paternity tests and individual identification. The number of alleles available for each marker ranges from 13 to 18, been 268 the total number of alleles investigated. The TRDscan v.2.0 software was used with the biallelic procedure to identify regions with distorted segregation ratios. After completing the analysis, a total of 12 alleles (out of 11 microsatellites) were identified with decisive evidence for genotypic TRD; 3 and 9 with additive and heterosis patterns, respectively. In addition, 19 alleles (out of 10 microsatellites) were identified displaying allelic TRD. Among them, 14 and 5 were parent-unspecific and stallion-mare-specific TRD. Out of the TRD regions, 24 genes were identified and annotated, predominantly associated with cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis. These genes are often linked to non-specific symptoms like impaired fertility, stunted growth, and compromised overall health. The results suggest a significant impact on the inheritance of certain genetic traits in horses. Further analysis and validation are needed to better understand the TRD impact before the potential implementation in the horse breeding programme strategies. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The treatment of tendinopathies with multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a promising option in equine and human medicine. However, conclusive clinical evidence is lacking. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into clinical treatment efficacy and to identify suitable outcome measures for larger clinical studies. Fifteen horses with early naturally occurring tendon disease were assigned to intralesional treatment with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs suspended in serum or with serum alone through block randomization (dosage adapted to lesion size). Clinicians and horse owners remained blinded to the treatment during 12 months (seven horses per group) and 18 months (seven MSC-group and five control-group horses) of follow-up including clinical examinations and diagnostic imaging. Clinical inflammation, lameness, and ultrasonography scores improved more over time in the MSC group. The lameness score difference significantly improved in the MSC group compared with the control group after 6 months. In the MSC group, five out of the seven horses were free of re-injuries and back to training until 12 and 18 months. In the control group, three out of the seven horses were free of re-injuries until 12 months. These results suggest that MSCs are effective for the treatment of early-phase tendon disease and provide a basis for a larger controlled study. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Treatment with phenylbutazone (nonselective COX inhibitor) decreases the diuretic and natriuretic effects of furosemide by nearly 30% but the effects of COX-2 specific inhibitors (firocoxib) and atypical NSAIDs (dipyrone) are unknown. Hypothesis: Furosemide-induced diuresis after pretreatment with firocoxib or dipyrone is diminished to a lesser extent than after pretreatment with phenylbutazone. Animals: Eight healthy mares. Methods: Each mare received 4 treatments in a prospective experimental crossover study using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin Square design: furosemide alone (FU), furosemide and phenylbutazone (PB), furosemide and firocoxib (FX), and furosemide and dipyrone (DP). After 24 hours of NSAID treatment at recommended dosages, ureteral catheters were placed for continual urine collection. After a 30-minute baseline collection period, furosemide (1.0 mg/kg, IV) was administered, and urine and blood samples were collected for 4 hours. Data were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Four-hour urine volume was (mean ± SD) ~25% less (P <.001) after pretreatment with all NSAIDs (PB 19.1 ± 2.1 mL/kg, FX 17.7 ± 3.5 mL/kg, DP 19.1 ± 3.9 mL/kg), as compared to FU (23.4 ± 5.1 mL/kg) (P <.001), but there were no differences between PB, FX, or DP. Interindividual variability in furosemide diuresis after pretreatment with different NSAIDs was observed. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Though COX-2 selective NSAIDs and dipyrone might have less severe or fever gastrointestinal adverse effects in horses, our data suggest minimal differences in effects on furosemide-induced diuresis, and possibly, risk of nephrotoxicosis. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: There are no detailed data on complications of sacroiliac (SI) joint region injections or on the variability of the methods and circumstances of injections among clinicians. Objectives: To describe complications following diagnostic, therapeutic and combined SI joint region injections and the details of how these are routinely performed by a large number of clinicians. Study design: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Methods: Clinicians (members of American and European specialist colleges and veterinarians known to the authors), invited by email, who had performed ≥1 SI joint region injection, completed an online questionnaire. Data collected included the clinicians' experience in diagnostic, therapeutic and combined SI joint region injections, details of the injection technique, volume and substance used, and the type of complications seen following SI joint region anaesthesia, medications and combined injections, respectively. Descriptive data analysis was performed and the association between any complications seen and the clinicians' experience, technique, volume and substance used were assessed using binary logistic regression. Results: Of the 212 respondents, 110 had performed diagnostic, 187 therapeutic and 49 combined injections. More clinicians experienced complications after diagnostic (53/110) than after therapeutic (33/187) or combined (6/49) injections (p < 0.01). The most common complications were hindlimb weakness/ataxia after all types of injections (diagnostic: 44/110, 40%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.8–49.8; therapeutic: 15/187, 8.0%, CI: 4.6–12.9; combined: 2/49, 4.1%, CI: 0.5–14.0). Death or horses requiring euthanasia were reported (after therapeutic injections: 5/187; diagnostic injections: 1/110). Main limitations: No prevalence of complications was established; no detailed descriptions of complications were available. Results may be influenced by selection and recall biases. Conclusions: Complications were experienced by more clinicians following diagnostic injections than after therapeutic or combined SI joint region injections, but the types and distribution of complications were similar. Results should be interpreted considering the previous reports of low prevalence of complications. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Host-associated microbiota can significantly impact host fitness. Therefore, naturally occurring variations in microbiota may influence the health and persistence of their hosts. This finding is particularly important in reintroduced animals, as they typically experience habitat changes during translocations. However, little is known about how microbiomes are altered in response to conservation translocation. Here, we accessed the gut microbiome of Przewalski's horse (Equus przewalskii) populations in China from three nature reserves (i.e. Xinjiang Kalamaili Nature Reserve, KNR; Dunhuang Xihu National Nature Reserve, DXNNR; and Anxi Extreme-arid Desert Nature Reserve, AENR) using 16s rRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. The results showed that the microbial composition and function differed significantly across locations, while a subset of core taxa was consistently present in most of the samples. The abundance of genes encoding microbe-produced enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, especially for glycoside hydrolases, was significantly higher in open-spaced KNR populations than in more confined AENR individuals. This study offers detailed and significant differential characters related to the microbial community and metabolic pathways in various reintroduced sites of Przewalski's horse, which might provide a basis for future microecological and conservation research on endangered reintroduced animals. © 2023 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Pancreatic disease in horses is rare and diagnosis is difficult due to lack of available diagnostic tests. Acute pancreatitis is associated with acute colic signs and gastrointestinal reflux; chronic pancreatitis with weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and mild recurrent colic symptoms. Therefore, horses presented with such unspecific symptoms are often treated routinely and a concurrent pancreatic disorder may be missed. A prospective study was initiated to investigate the occurrence of pancreatic disease in horses with corresponding clinical signs. During the study period from 2018 2019, sixty-seven horses (39 geldings, 26 mares, 2 stallions) aged 1 26 years with Warmbloods being the predominant breed were included. In 48 horses, the pancreatic enzymes ?-Amylase (AMY) and DGGR-lipase (LIP) were measured in serum (S) and peritoneal fluid (PF). In addition, cytologic examination from PF, complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemistry (SBC) were performed. In 19 horses, including 14 control horses without clinical signs, pancreatic enzymes were measured from serum samples only. In one horse with colic symptoms, LIP was elevated in S; in another horse with duodenitis-proximal jejunitis and septic peritonitis, LIP was elevated in PF. In both horses, a pancreatic component was considered to play a role. A third horse had measured enzymes within normal ranges, but postmortem examination revealed chronic pancreatitis. These results suggest that pancreatic disease has a low prevalence in horses, but should be considered as an additional differential diagnosis in patients with indistinct abdominal symptoms. © 2023 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Malformations of the equine cervicothoracic junction affect the C6 and C7 cervical vertebrae, the T1 thoracic vertebra and in variable extent the first and second sternal ribs. To date, the clinical impact of this malformation, its prevalence and mode of inheritance in equine populations are not yet determined. We examined five skeletons for signs of malformation of the cervicothoracic junction, including three skeletons from widely used Thoroughbred stallions affected with the malformation and two skeletons serving as a comparison. The three affected historical horses were the Thoroughbred stallions Der Loewe XX, Birkhahn XX and their common great grandsire Dark Ronald XX. Malformations of C6 and C7 showed a large variation between the three stallions, as Dark Ronald XX, Der Loewe XX and Birkhahn XX were affected uni-laterally at C6 and C7, uni-laterally at C6 and bi-laterally at C6 and C7, respectively, with varying grades. In order to evaluate whether or not these malformations are incidental, we took a random sample of 20 living German Warmblood horses, which are distant descendants of these stallions. This sample consisted of ten controls and ten horses with malformations of C6/C7. Blood proportions of the historical sires in the modern Warmblood horses ranged from 0.10 to 6.25%. The contribution to inbreeding in each individual horse of our selected horse group by those sires was expressed as a percentage of the total inbreeding coefficient and ranged from 0.01 to 17.96%, demonstrating their influence on the modern Warmblood. In the present study, we were able to describe the variability of the malformation of C6/C7 within a horse family including historic and modern horses. Additionally, we detected variations appearing in connection with malformations of the cervicothoracic junction that have not been described in the literature yet. This is the first time that the malformations of C6 and C7 have been described within a familial context, providing hints on inheritance in Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods. It is worthwhile to carry out further studies in a larger setting to gain more comprehensive insights into the inheritance of the malformation and the role of important ancestors. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Measurement of the intraocular pressure (IOP) is a useful diagnostic tool in equine ophthalmology. Handheld tonometers, such as Tonovet and Tonovet Plus (rebound), Tono-Pen AVIA Vet (applanation), and Kowa HA-2 (applanation using the Goldmann methodology) are used to obtain IOP measurements in veterinary medicine. Objectives: To compare and evaluate the accuracy of four handheld tonometers in measuring IOP using different methodologies in healthy horses. Study design: In vivo experiment and cross-sectional survey of healthy horses. Methods: Intraocular pressure was measured in 72 eyes of 36 horses. An in vivo study was conducted on sedated horses to compare the real IOP values obtained using manometry versus those obtained using tonometry, and a field study was conducted on unsedated healthy horses with normal eyes to measure the IOP values using different tonometers. Results: In the in vivo study, the mean IOP values using ocular manometry was 24.9 ± 4.0 mmHg (range, 20.0–30.0 mmHg). The mean IOP values using tonometry were: Tonovet, 25.7 ± 5.8 mmHg (range 19.5–33.0 mmHg); Tonovet Plus, 24.8 ± 7.1 mmHg (range 13.2–33.2 mmHg); Tono Pen AVIA Vet, 19.2 ± 4.7 mmHg (range 13.1–26.5 mmHg); and Kowa Ha-2, 24.1 ± 1.2 mmHg (range 22.8–25.8 mmHg). In the field study, the IOP values were: Tonovet, 30.7 ± 5.6 mmHg (range 21.7–38.0 mmHg); Tonovet Plus, 29.6 ± 6.7 mmHg (range 16.2–38.6 mmHg); Tono-Pen AVIA Vet, 27.3 ± 5.8 mmHg (range 14.6–37.1 mmHg); and Kowa HA-2, 23.4 ± 2.2 mmHg (range 20.2–28.7 mmHg). Main limitations: This study included only healthy horses and a limited number of animals in the in vivo study. Conclusions: There was a strong correlation between the IOP values and manometry for all tonometers. IOP should be estimated using the same tonometer over time, and the bias of the tonometer used, such as overestimation (rebound tonometer) and underestimation (applanation tonometer), should be acknowledged. A normal reference value for each tonometer should be established in horses. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by monogenic mutations in genes encoding for proteins related to the lysosomal function. Lysosome plays critical roles in molecule degradation and cell signaling through interplay with many other cell organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes. Even though several strategies (i.e., protein replacement and gene therapy) have been attempted for LSDs with promising results, there are still some challenges when hard-to-treat tissues such as bone (i.e., cartilages, ligaments, meniscus, etc.), the central nervous system (mostly neurons), and the eye (i.e., cornea, retina) are affected. Consistently, searching for novel strategies to reach those tissues remains a priority. Molecular Trojan Horses have been well-recognized as a potential alternative in several pathological scenarios for drug delivery, including LSDs. Even though molecular Trojan Horses refer to genetically engineered proteins to overcome the blood-brain barrier, such strategy can be extended to strategies able to transport and deliver drugs to specific tissues or cells using cell-penetrating peptides, monoclonal antibodies, vesicles, extracellular vesicles, and patient-derived cells. Only some of those platforms have been attempted in LSDs. In this paper, we review the most recent efforts to develop molecular Trojan Horses and discuss how this strategy could be implemented to enhance the current efficacy of strategies such as protein replacement and gene therapy in the context of LSDs. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Domesticated horses are often housed in individual stables for long periods where physical contact with conspecifics is not possible. Although common, this form of stable design is known to be detrimental to horse welfare. This study investigated the impact of short-term stabling (1-hour bouts) on behavioral expression using three stable conditions: a full wall, a barred window wall, and a half wall between paired horses in a within-subjects design study (N = 18). A mixed model (restricted maximum likelihood) was used to account for both stable condition and individual horse within the model. Behaviors influenced by stable design were those relating to vigilance and social affiliation. Horses spent a greater proportion of the observation time standing alert when in the full wall stable compared to the half wall stable (P = 0.009). The opposite is true of time spent standing and resting (P < 0.001). Compared to the window wall alone, horses in the half wall stable performed significantly more contact-seeking behaviors (P = 0.021). Horse owners often perceive stable design unimportant if only used for short periods of time, with the majority of their time budget spent at pasture with conspecifics. These results indicate that, even during short bouts of stabling, horses were more relaxed when stable design allowed them to engage in social behaviors with conspecifics and more vigilant when stable design left them physically isolated from conspecifics. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: As a domesticated species vital to humans, horses are raised worldwide as a source of mechanical energy for sports, leisure, food production, and transportation. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the health, diseases, athletic performance, and behaviour of horses. Results: Here, using approximately 2.2 Tb of metagenomic sequencing data from gut samples from 242 horses, including 110 samples from the caecum and 132 samples from the rectum (faeces), we assembled 4142 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG), 4015 (96.93%) of which appear to correspond to new species. From long-read data, we successfully assembled 13 circular whole-chromosome bacterial genomes representing novel species. The MAG contained over 313,568 predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), over 59.77% of which had low similarity match in CAZy public databases. High abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) were identified in the MAG, likely showing the wide use of antibiotics in the management of horse. The abundances of at least 36 MAG (e.g. MAG belonging to Lachnospiraceae, Oscillospiraceae, and Ruminococcus) were higher in racehorses than in nonracehorses. These MAG enriched in racehorses contained every gene in a major pathway for producing acetate and butyrate by fibre fermentation, presenting potential for greater amount of short-chain fatty acids available to fuel athletic performance. Conclusion: Overall, we assembled 4142 MAG from short- and long-read sequence data in the horse gut. Our dataset represents an exhaustive microbial genome catalogue for the horse gut microbiome and provides a valuable resource for discovery of performance-enhancing microbes and studies of horse gut microbiome.

ABSTRACT: There is a consensus that future medicine will benefit from a comprehensive analysis of harmonized, interconnected, and interoperable health data. These data can originate from a variety of sources. In particular, data from veterinary diagnostics and the monitoring of health-related life parameters using the Internet of Medical Things are considered here. To foster the usage of collected data in this way, not only do technical aspects need to be addressed but so do organizational ones, and to this end, a socio-technical matrix is first presented that complements the literature. It is used in an exemplary analysis of the system. Such a socio-technical matrix is an interesting tool for analyzing the process of data sharing between actors in the system dependent on their social relations. With the help of such a socio-technical tool and using equine veterinary medicine as an example, the social system of veterinarians and owners as actors is explored in terms of barriers and enablers of an effective digital representation of the global equine population. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Discospondylitis is an inflammatory condition involving the vertebral bodies and is rarely reported in horses. Clinical signs are associated with neck stiffness and forelimb ataxia. In other species, treatment consists mainly of antibiotics coupled with non-steroidal analgesics for a period of 3–12 weeks. An inadequate response to conservative treatment requires surgical intervention, but there is limited information in the literature regarding surgical management in large animals. A 3-year-old Quarter Horse gelding presented for an approximately 4-week history of generalised stiffness and reluctance to move. Computed tomography with myelogram revealed abnormalities consistent with discospondylitis at the level of the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae (C7-T1). The patient underwent cervical vertebral interbody fusion using a combination of compression of the vertebral bodies using cortical screws in lag fashion and a 4-hole locking compression plate (LCP). The patient was discharged from the hospital with marked improvement. At the time of this report, 4 months after the procedure, the horse continues to show marked improvement in mobility and range of motion. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Identifying intake levels of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) that limit the postprandial insulinaemic response in the insulin dysregulated (ID) horse may help reduce hyperinsulinaemia-associated laminitis (HAL) risk. Objective: To determine if ID horses have thresholds for pure sources of starch and sugar, above which there is an augmented insulin response. Study design: Randomised crossover experiment. Methods: Fourteen adult horses (6 ID and 8 noninsulin dysregulated, NID; matched for bodyweight) were randomly fed eight dietary treatments. Dietary treatments were formulated using a base of low-nonstructural carbohydrate pellet (LNSC; 0.04 g of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs)/kg bwt and 0.01 g of starch/kg bwt), to which pure sugar (dextrose) or starch (50:50 mix of waxy-maize and oat starch powder) sources were titrated to create diets with increasing amounts of either WSC (0.06–0.17 g WSC/kg bwt), or starch (0.03–0.1 g starch/kg bwt). Horses were fed each dietary treatment at a rate of 1 g/kg bwt once over 12 weeks. Serial blood samples were collected pre- and up to 240 min postprandially. Insulin was determined via RIA and diet analytes were determined via wet chemistry. Statistical analysis was performed with a mixed effect model. Positive incremental area under the curve for insulin (IAUCi) was calculated for all horses and dietary treatments. Results: There was no significant effect of diet in NID horses but diets with NSC >0.1 g/kg bwt produced an augmented response in ID horses compared with the LNSC (p < 0.05). ID horses IAUCi were also significantly different to all NID IAUCi for diets with NSC >0.1 g/kg (p < 0.04). Apparent thresholds for sugar and starch addition varied. Conclusions: Based on this study, using supplemental pure starch and sugar sources, ID horses seem to have an apparent threshold for NSC of around 0.1 g/kg bwt/meal, above which significantly increased insulin responses are seen compared with NID horses. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The study presents the results of a cross-sectional survey to describe the epidemiology of ascarid and strongylid nematodes in horses, the impact of diverse climatic conditions on parasite diversity and the levels of faecal egg shedding in different age groups of managed Thoroughbred horses. Individual faecal samples (n = 1377) collected from 62 Thoroughbred farms across four climatic zones in Australia were analysed using the modified McMaster technique for faecal egg counts (FECs) and strongylid nematodes were identified utilising PCR-directed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the second internal transcribed spacer of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS-2). Across all age groups, the prevalence of ascarid and strongylid nematodes was 12% (95% confidence interval 10–14%) and 72% (70–74%), respectively. Based on strongylid FECs, yearlings had the highest prevalence (89%) followed by weanlings (83%), foals (79%), wet mares (61%), dry mares (59%) and stallions (54%). However, for Parascaris spp., foals had the highest prevalence (46%) followed by weanlings (32%) and yearlings (13%). The highest mean FECs for Parascaris spp. were observed in foals (418 eggs per gram [EPG] of faeces) while those for strongylids were in yearlings (1002 EPG). Of the adult horses (mares and stallions), 67% (489 of 729) and 11% (77 of 729) were low (i.e., ≤250 EPG) and moderate (i.e., 251–500 EPG) strongylid egg-shedders, respectively. Strongylid egg shedding varied across climatic zones, with the highest mean FECs in the summer rainfall (723 EPG) followed by non-seasonal rainfall (629 EPG), winter rainfall (613 EPG), and Mediterranean (606 EPG) rainfall zones. Twenty-three nematode species were detected using NGS, with Cylicostephanus longibursatus (28%), Cylicocyclus nassatus (23%) and Coronocyclus coronatus (23%), being the most abundant species. Three species of Strongylus (i.e., S. vulgaris, S. equinus and S. edentatus) were also detected. The nemabiome composition, species richness and relative abundance varied within horse age and between climatic zones. These empirical findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of parasites within horse populations and the multifaceted factors that influence their occurrence, thereby allowing for the formulation of tailored strategies aimed at parasite control in domestic horses. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Omega-3 fatty acid and alpha-tocopherol supplementation reduces gastric ulcer formation in humans and rodents; however, efficacy of prevention in horses is unknown. Equine Omega Complete (EOC) is an oral supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids and alpha-tocopherol. Hypothesis/Objective: Determine if EOC supplementation prevents gastric ulcers and increases serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations in healthy horses. Animals: Nine thoroughbred geldings; 5-13 years old. Methods: Prospective randomized block design, repeated in crossover model. Horses were administered EOC, omeprazole, or water PO for 28 days. Horses underwent an established gastric ulcer induction protocol from days 21-28 via intermittent feed deprivation. Gastroscopies were performed on days 0, 21, and 28. Serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations were measured on days 0 and 28. The effects of treatment and time on ulcer grades were assessed with ordinal logistic regression, with significance at P-value <.05. Results: Ulcer grades increased during ulcer induction in control and EOC but not omeprazole groups (P =.02). Grades increased in EOC-treated horses after ulcer induction from a median of 1 [95% confidence interval 0-2.5] (day 0) to 2.5 [1.5-3.5] (day 28) and were similar to the control group (P =.54). Serum alpha-tocopherol increased in EOC-treated horses from day 0 to day 28 (mean 2.2 (Formula presented.) 0.43 μg/mL to 2.96 (Formula presented.) 0.89 μg/mL; P <.001) with high individual variation; this increase was not different from omeprazole or control groups. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Supplementation with EOC for 28 days did not prevent gastric ulcer formation nor increase alpha-tocopherol concentrations relative to the control group. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant organic material, which can be utilised in biogas plants for sustainable production of biogas. Since these substrates usually have high lignin contents and consist of rather elongated particles, a special pretreatment is required for an economical and process-stable utilisation in the biogas plant. The mechanical pretreatment of horse manure was carried out with the prototype of a ball mill at different speeds. The aim of ball milling is to comminute the substrate and disintegrate the lignocellulosic bond. Mechanical pretreatment in the ball mill resulted in a significant increase in specific methane yield of more than 37% in anaerobic batch digestion (up to 243 LCH4 kgVS−1) of horse manure. The kinetics of the methane gas formation process was analysed by a modified Gompertz model fitting and showed a higher methane production potential and maximum daily methane production rate as well as a lower duration of the lag phase after pretreatment at 6 rpm. This was further confirmed by sieve analyses, which showed a significant reduction of particle size compared to the untreated variant. Thus, the use of the ball mill increases the specific methane yield and improves the fermentation of lignocellulosic substrates such as horse manure.

ABSTRACT: We aimed to evaluate the impact of corpus luteum (CL) and uterine characteristics accessed by B-mode and Color-Doppler ultrasonography in recipient mares at the time of embryo transfer (ET) on pregnancy outcomes. Recipient mares (n = 110), between days 3–9 after spontaneous ovulation, received a fresh embryo. Immediately before ET, the reproductive system was assessed by transrectal palpation for the following parameters: uterine tone (0–3), CL echogenicity (0–6), CL type (homogeneous, trabecular or anechoic center), luteal area (cm2), uterine echogenicity (0–3), uterine edema (0–3), luteal blood perfusion (0–100%) and uterine blood perfusion (1–4). Additionally, a blood sample was collected by puncture of the jugular vein for plasma P4 dosage. Retrospectively, recipients were classified according to the luteal area (small [≤ 6 cm2] or large [> 6 cm2]), luteal blood perfusion (low [≤ 55%] or high [> 55%]), and plasma concentration of P4 (low ≤ 9.98 ng/mL or high > 9.98 ng/mL). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at 12 and 30 days of gestation. Luteal blood perfusion was significantly higher (P = 0.04) in pregnant recipients (n = 83) than in non-pregnant recipients (n = 27). Overall P/ET was higher (P ≤ 0.02) in mares with high luteal blood perfusion and high P4. Luteal blood perfusion was the most adequate significant (P = 0.01) predictor of pregnancy compared with the luteal area and plasma P4 concentration. Only luteal blood perfusion showed a linear (P = 0.03) and cubic (P = 0.004) effect on P/ET. In conclusion, CL blood perfusion determined by color-Doppler can be used in real-time to select recipients with the greatest chance of maintaining pregnancy in equine ET programs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to evaluate the fishery status of the Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) stock in the western Egyptian Mediterranean waters. Random monthly samples of fish were collected during the period from April 2015 to March 2016, with a total of 1054 fish. Growth parameters were determined and the vectors of natural mortality (M) by age, total mortality (Z) and fishing mortality (F), length cohort analysis, and Beverton & Holt Yield per recruit analysis were performed by FiSAT and Virtual Population Analysis (VIT software) programs to estimate the limit and target reference points. The present results showed that the Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞ = 29.58 cm, K = 0.27 years-1, and t0 =-1.49 year. The mean values of Z, F and M were 0.828, 0.575 and 0.253 year-1, respectively. The exploitation rate (E) was 0.694 year. The current yield per recruit (Y/R), biomass per recruit (B/R), and spawning stock biomass (SSB) at the current fishing mortality (0.575 year-1) were 14.27, 31.35 and 12.15g, respectively. The percentage of the current B/R to the virgin biomass was 25.11%. The reference point F0.1 = 0.27, and the limit reference point (FMAX) was 0.48 year-1. These two values are lower than the current value of fishing mortality (0.575 year-). The ratio between FC and F0.1 was 2.128; this value indicates that T. trachurus stock in the Egyptian Mediterranean waters is at a high over exploitation state. © 2023, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

ABSTRACT: Background: Thousands of years of natural and artificial selection since the domestication of the horse has shaped the distinctive genomes of Chinese Mongolian horse populations. Consequently, genomic signatures of selection can provide insights into the human-mediated selection history of specific traits and evolutionary adaptation to diverse environments. Here, we used genome-wide SNPs from five distinct Chinese Mongolian horse populations to identify genomic regions under selection for the population-specific traits, gait, black coat colour, and hoof quality. Other global breeds were used to identify regional-specific signatures of selection. Results: We first identified the most significant selection peak for the Wushen horse in the region on ECA23 harbouring DMRT3, the major gene for gait. We detected selection signatures encompassing several genes in the Baicha Iron Hoof horse that represent good biological candidates for hoof health, including the CSPG4, PEAK1, EXPH5, WWP2 and HAS3 genes. In addition, an analysis of regional subgroups (Asian compared to European) identified a single locus on ECA3 containing the ZFPM1 gene that is a marker of selection for the major domestication event leading to the DOM2 horse clade. Conclusions: Genomic variation at these loci in the Baicha Iron Hoof may be leveraged in other horse populations to identify animals with superior hoof health or those at risk of hoof-related pathologies. The overlap between the selection signature in Asian horses with the DOM2 selection peak raises questions about the nature of horse domestication events, which may have involved a prehistoric clade other than DOM2 that has not yet been identified. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Perirectal abscesses have only rarely been reported in horses. This case series describes the clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of six horses with this condition. The equids affected were geldings or stallions of various breeds and aged from 4 months to 21 years (median age 10 months). Typical clinical signs included colic with tachycardia, tenesmus, dyschezia and abdominal distension. The diagnosis was obtained by transrectal palpation and ultrasonographic examination in five of six horses and by median laparotomy in one horse. All abscesses were located dorsally to the rectum. Rectal impaction and large colon tympany were common secondary findings. Microbiologic examination of abscess content revealed Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus in all horses. Abscesses were treated by a combination of medical and surgical approaches. One horse had to be euthanised due to complete obstruction of the pelvis by the abscess. In the other horses (5/6), the disorder was associated with an excellent prognosis. In terms of the total population of horses presenting with colic in the investigated period, the prevalence of cases with perirectal abscesses was 0.4%. Although uncommon, described cases indicate that perirectal abscesses should be considered as differential diagnosis for young and mature horses with colic signs. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses are transported in the United States more than any other livestock species and co-mingle at various events; therefore, they are considered to be at an increased risk for infectious disease transmission. The fragmented movement of horses combined with numerous sites of co-mingling makes tracing the potential spread of a disease outbreak a necessary part of an infection control plan, both locally and nationally. The cross-movement of personnel with horses and the persistence of endemic diseases make biosecurity implementation an ongoing challenge. Although many of the risks for infection are known, there is limited documentation about the usefulness of prospective control measures. The objective of this survey was to determine horse owners’ understanding and knowledge of biosecurity practices for preventing infectious diseases in the United States. Questions covered owner demographic information, including horse use which was divided into 10 categories as follows: Pleasure/Trail Riding, Lessons/School, Western Show, English Show, Breeding, Farm/Ranch, Retired, Racing, Driving and Other. The survey was distributed by sending requests to a list of horse owner organizations, which then sent emails to their members. The email request described the survey and provided a website link to start the survey. A total of 2413 responses were collected. Analysis of the results included cross-tabulation to identify significant differences in biosecurity knowledge and awareness by horse use. Significant differences by horse use were identified for vaccination, biosecurity planning, use of isolation, disease risk, monitoring for diseases, co-mingling of horses, sanitation, medical decision making and health record requirements for horse events. In summary, the results suggest that most owners are not highly concerned about the risk of disease or the use of biosecurity. There are several biosecurity applications and techniques which can be increased and will benefit horse health and welfare. These include reliance on temperature monitoring, isolation of new horses at facilities, risks of horse mingling, entry requirements such as vaccination and health certificates at events, and an emphasis on having biosecurity plans for facilities and events where horses co-mingle. The information from this study will be used to create tools and information that horse owners and veterinarians can use to implement appropriate biosecurity practices for different types of horse uses and events. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is caused by Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, transmitted by tick vectors. Horses can suffer an acute, subacute, and chronic forms of the disease, with clinical signs such as poor performance, fever, pale mucosal membranes, and jaundice. The diagnosis of EP subclinical cases is complex due to the sensitivity of real-time PCR and the limited parasite load in some carriers, making it challenging to differentiate them from seropositive, PCR negative (S+PCR-) individuals. This study aimed to describe haematological and biochemical changes in asymptomatic EP carriers, EP S+PCR- horses and control horses (EP seronegative and PCR negative). It also investigated potential haemato-biochemical markers to aid in distinguishing true EP carriers alongside molecular and serological tests. A comprehensive haematology and biochemistry profile was conducted on 410 sera and EDTA blood samples, comprising 130 EP positives by real-time PCR and competitive ELISA (cELISA) (carriers), 130 EP negatives by real-time PCR but positive to cELISA (S+PCR-) and 150 EP negative horses to real-time PCR and c-ELISA (controls). Our study confirmed that a haematological and biochemistry profile could help to differentiate between EP carriers/S+PCR- from healthy horses. Carriers and S+PCR- horses showed significant increases in the white blood cell count (WBC), high total proteins (TP) and total globulins (GLOB) concentration, and liver function markers compared to controls. Additionally, the evaluation of uric acid (UA) suggested oxidative stress in carrier horses. However, no useful haemato-biochemical diagnostic markers were identified to aid the challenging differentiation of EP carriers and S+PCR- horses, highlighting the need for improvement in molecular/serological diagnosis for these horses. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The clinical findings of pleural empyema in six horses were retrospectively studied using epidemiological, clinical pathology, microbiological, ultrasound, and post-mortem data. The clinical findings included tachycardia (n = 3/6), tachypnea (n = 6/6), cyanotic mucosa (n = 2/6), hyperthermia (n = 4/6), inspiratory or mixed dyspnea (n = 6/6), presence of fluid and/or pleural rubbing (n = 2/6) and coarse crackling on auscultation (n = 4/6). Horses demonstrated leukocytosis (16.22 × 103/µL) with neutrophilia (12.32 × 103/µL) and hyperfibrinogenemia (633.33 mg/dL) and an increase in urea (69.80 mg/kg) and globulins (5.22 g/dL). The pleural fluid exhibited exudate (n = 5/6). The pathogens isolated from transtracheal wash (TTW) and/or pleural effusion included Aspergillus fumigatus, Enterobacter cloacae, alpha and beta hemolytic Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and beta hemolytic Staphylococcus. The in vitro tests of microbial sensitivity of the isolates revealed that ceftiofur (5/6) and penicillin (3/6) were the most effective drugs. The fatality rate was 83% (5/6). The main post-mortem finding was the presence of fibrin in the pleural cavity with adhesion between the parietal and visceral pleura. These results show that pleural empyema is a complex disease pathophysiology that is refractory to conventional treatment. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common performance limiting arrhythmia in racehorses. High dose exercise and airway disease promote AF in humans. Few studies have investigated epidemiological factors associated with AF in horses. Objectives: Explore variables relating to performance, exercise volume and postrace endoscopic findings in horses with AF. Animals: A total of 164 horses with poor race performance and postrace AF were compared to 321 horses with poor performance without AF (PP) and 314 horses performing to expectation (TE). Methods: Horse-level and race-level variables for horses racing in Australia and Hong Kong from 2009 to 2021 were compared using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Postrace endoscopic exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) and tracheal mucus accumulation (TMA) grades for AF and PP horses were compared using chi-squared analysis. Results: Variables that were significant in the multivariable model of AF compared to TE were distance (lengths) behind the winner, (odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.41 [1.32-1.51], P <.0001), cumulative prize money per start before the event (OR [95% CI] 1.02 [1.01-1.03], P =.01) and age (OR [95% CI] 0.72 [0.55-0.92], P =.01). More AF horses had EIPH grade (Formula presented.) 3 (23/109; 21.1%) than PP horses (7/213; 3.3%; OR [95%CI] 7.9 [3.3-20.2], P <.0001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Acute race performance was substantially impaired by AF but career earnings before the event were not inferior. Exercise volume did not promote AF.

ABSTRACT: Background: Lameness examination is commonly required in equine veterinary practice, whether it's to investigate a lameness already identified by the owner, or as part of the investigation of poor performance. Aim of the article: This article outlines a systematic approach to adopt when presented with a lame horse. Although it focuses on examination of the distal limb, the same principles apply when examining the proximal limb. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: In June 2022, at the XXXII Conference of the Italian Society of Parasitology, the parallels of the main endoparasitic infections of horses and donkeys were discussed. Although these 2 species are genetically different, they can be challenged by a similar range of parasites (i.e. small and large strongyles, and Parascaris spp.). Although equids can demonstrate some level of resilience to parasites, they have quite distinct helminth biodiversity, distribution and intensity among different geographical locations and breeds. Heavily infected donkeys may show fewer clinical signs than horses. Although parasite control is primarily provided to horses, we consider that there may be a risk of drug-resistance parasitic infection through passive infection in donkeys when sharing the same pasture areas. Knowing the possible lack of drug efficacy (<90 or 80%), it is advocated the use of selective treatment for both species based on fecal egg counts. Adult horses should receive treatment when the threshold exceeds 200-500 eggs per gram (EPG) of small strongyles. Moreover, considering that there are no precise indications in donkeys, a value >300 EPG may be a safe recommendation. We have highlighted the main points of the discussion including the dynamics of helminth infections between the 2 species.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: The effect of lactate minimum speed (LMS)-guided training on horses’ homeostasis is still unknown. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of an LMS-guided training program on the fluid, electrolyte and acid-base status of horses. Ten untrained Arabian horses were submitted to an LMS test on a treadmill before and after six weeks of training. The training intensity was 80% of the LMS in the first three sessions and 100% of the LMS in the other sessions. The venous blood was collected before (T-1) and after (T-2) training at rest, during and after the LMS test for lactate, pH, pCO2, HCO3−, and electrolyte measurements. The LMS and strong ion difference (SID4) were calculated. A mild increase in the mean values (p > 0.05) was observed at rest in T-2 in comparison with T-1 in the following variables: pH (from 7.436 ± 0.013 to 7.460 ± 0.012), pCO2 (from 42.95 ± 1.58 to 45.06 ± 0.81 mmHg), HCO3− (from 27.01 ± 1.02 to 28.91 ± 0.86 mmol/L), and SID4 (from 33.42 ± 1.45 to 35.06 ± 2.94 mmol/L). During T-2, these variables were more stable than during T-1. Despite the improvement in fitness, the LMS did not indicate a significant difference (from 5.40 ± 0.55 to 5.52 ± 0.20 m/s). The results confirmed that the LMS-guided training program had a positive impact on the horses’ acid-base status, although some adaptations are still required to improve their fitness. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the genetic diversity and structure of domesticated horse (Equus caballus) populations is critical for long-term herd management and breeding programs. This study examines 435 horses from Kazakhstan, covering seven groups in three geographic areas using 11 STR markers. Identified are 136 alleles, with the mean number of alleles per locus ranging from 9 to 19. VHL20 is the most variable locus across groups, while loci HTG4, AHT4, AHT5, HTG7, and HMS3 are variable in most populations. The locus AHT5 in the Emba population shows the highest frequency of rare alleles, while the lowest frequency, 0.005, is observed in the Kulandy population. All loci were highly informative for the Kazakhstani populations of E. caballus, with PIC values higher than 0.5. Pairwise variations in Wright’s FST distances show that the examined varieties have little genetic differentiation (0.05%), indicating a high degree of admixture and a continuing lineage sorting process. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses reveal three major clusters of Kazakh horses, representing (I) the Uralsk population of the Kushum breed and the monophyly of two groups: (II) the Kozhamberdy population of the Mugalzhar breed, and (III) the Mugalzhar–Kushum breed populations. Kazakhstani horse populations, while being regionally isolated, were recently in contact with each other. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses competing in cross-country tests are subjected to high physical demands. Within the scope of this prospective longitudinal study, blood values of 20 elite eventing horses were examined before and after two- to four-star cross-country rides. The aim was to find out whether blood-based markers for skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle function change after cross-country exercise. Parameters that provide information about fluid balance, muscle enzymes, metabolites and cardiac muscle-specific markers were investigated. We developed an approach to eliminate the concentration changes caused by reduced plasma volume. Parameters were measured pre, 10 and 30 min post exercise and the next morning and were evaluated using a mixed model. Thirty minutes after exercise, most parameter concentrations changed in an exercise-dependent manner. The next morning, most exercise-related markers recovered rapidly, while creatine kinase (CK) (26% increase; p = 0.008) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (15% increase; p < 0.001) showed a declining but sustained increase. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) increased above the reference range in 40 of the 55 rides (73%) and in 18 of 20 horses in the morning after exercise. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Salt is a nutritional requirement for horses. The behavior patterns and physiological controls of salt (NaCl) intake were investigated. Camera traps were used to record visits to a salt block in a herd of pleasure horses of various breeds. There was a relation between the hours the horses were ridden per week and the number of times they licked salt over a 2-week period. The horses responded to exercise with an increase in salt intake. Owners should be aware that horses should have access to a salt block in order to meet the animals' physiological needs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Social buffering occurs when a companion helps to reduce a subject's stress response during a stressful event and/or to recover more quickly from a stressful event. The aim of this study was to determine if any social buffering function of a horse companion can occur in relation to a visual substitute (poster of a relaxed horse face) during two different stressful situations: a novel object test (a ball presented gradually) and an umbrella test (sudden opening of an umbrella). In order to evaluate the effect of a horse face poster on the subject's stress responses, behavioral (reactivity score) and physiological (heart rate) measurements were taken. Each of the 28 study subjects completed four trials: two novel object tests and two umbrella tests—each with a relaxed horse face poster and a pixelated poster (control). Our results showed that the presence of a horse face poster might significantly reduce the behavioral response (reactivity) of subject horses in the novel object test but did not improve heart rate recovery (HRR) time. The horse face poster did not have a significant effect on the behavioral reaction or HRR in the umbrella test. Any effect of a horse face poster as a potential social buffer might potentially depend on the nature of the stressful event. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Accumulating evidence supports the role of microbiota in autoimmune processes, but research regarding the role of the gut microbiota in celiac disease (CD) is still emerging, and a consistent CD-associated dysbiosis pattern has not yet been defined. Here, we characterized the microbiota of children newly diagnosed with CD, with their unaffected family members as a healthy control group to reduce confounding factors including genetic background, hygiene, dietary habits, and environment, and followed children with CD over 1 year of dietary intervention (exclusion of gluten) to understand if the microbiota is associated with CD and its mediation. We did not find differences in the microbiota of siblings with and without CD, despite a wealth of evidence in the literature supporting CD-specific microbiota. CD is common among first-degree relatives, so this could suggest that unaffected family members in this study may be living in a pre-CD state, currently below clinical detection. Interestingly, despite the effectiveness of diet in CD control, we did not observe diet-mediated microbiota changes, except for short-term increase in Akkermansia muciniphila. This lack of effect could suggest a very strong CD microbial signature even when controlled or could be a technical shortcoming. Expanded future studies with both related and unrelated controls and diet interventions in both the CD and control arms can provide further context to our findings. IMPORTANCE The microbiota is the community of microbes that live in and on us. These microbes are essential to our health and everyday function. Disruption of the community is associated with diseases ranging from metabolic syndrome to autoimmune diseases to mental disorders. In the case of celiac disease (CD), research remains inconclusive regarding implications of the microbiota in etiology. Here, we compared microbiota of children with CD to those of their unaffected family members and found very few differences in microbiota profiles. We next examined how gluten elimination in CD patients affects the microbiota. Surprisingly, despite diet adherence, microbiota shifts were minimal, with only a short-term increase in Akkermansia muciniphila. Previous studies suggest that family members of CD patients may be living in a pre-CD state, which could explain their microbial similarity. A larger study with unrelated controls and increased microbiota monitoring during diet intervention should give our findings more perspective. Copyright © 2023 Turjeman et al.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The influence of the average annual sea surface temperature (SST) on the development of the horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus on the southwestern Crimean shelf has been shown. The changes in the main indicators of the population and their relationship with the change in the average annual SST (0.055°С/year) in 2000–2020 have been identified. Against the background of the observed increase in SST in recent years, the state of the horse mackerel population has improved: there has been an increase in the average age and, accordingly, the proportion of larger well-fed individuals, and, in general, the average size and weight of fish. It has been shown that according to the nature of the change in the average annual SST, three periods can be distinguished: 2000−2007, 2008−2013, and 2014−2020. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Antivenom production against Loxosceles venom relies on horses being immunized and bled for plasma harvest. One horse can partake in several cycles of antivenom production, which will require years of constant venom and adjuvant inoculation and bleeding. The actual impact on the health of horses that participate in several antivenom-producing cycles is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the general health status of horses that underwent at least six cycles of loxoscelic antivenom production. Seven crossbred horses that had partaken in six to eight complete antivenom-producing cycles were used and established as the immunized group (IG). Under the same handling and general management, eleven horses were established as the control group (CG). The horses were evaluated regarding their general clinical status and had their blood sampled, and an ECG recorded. The IG presented lower RBC and PCV, despite keeping values within inferior limits for the species. Renal function was not impaired, and liver-related enzymes were higher than those in the CG, probably due to liver exertion from immunoglobulin synthesis. ECG showed some abnormalities in the IG, such as atrioventricular block and a wandering atrial pacemaker, corroborated by an increase in CK-MB. The cardiovascular abnormalities were mainly found in the horses that participated in several antivenom-producing cycles. The overall results indicate that these horses had some impairment of their general health status. Once available, some alternative, less toxic antigens should replace the venom for immunization of horses used for antivenom production. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study determined Tregs and inflammatory cytokines in BALF and peripheral blood (PB) of adult horses with mild and severe asthma and different BALF cytological inflammation profiles. Horses of diverse breeds with asthma (age range: 2–20 years, n = 24) were divided into groups according to the number of points obtained in a standardized clinical scoring system (mild-moderate equine asthma – MEA, severe equine asthma – SEA) and according to the inflammation type based on cytological finding. Plasma levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and MMP-9 in the BALF were determined by ELISA. Tregs in the BALF and PB were detected by flow cytometry. Horses with SEA were older than horses with MEA and had higher concentrations of MMP-9 in the BALF (P < 0.05). The neutrophilic inflammation group was characterised by higher age, grade of clinical score, percentage of Tregs and MMP-9 concentration in the BALF compared to the mastocytic inflammation group (P < 0.05). Age positively correlated with neutrophils, grade of score, Tregs in the BALF and in the PB. The grade of score positively correlated with MMP-9. The percentage of Tregs in the BALF positively correlated with Tregs in the PB. Tregs in the BALF and PB positively correlated with neutrophils and MMP-9 in the BALF and with IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 in the plasma. IFN-γ and IL-10 in the plasma positively correlated with the age. The results indicate that the evaluation of selected parameters in PB, the collection of which is less invasive than the collection of BALF, is of potential importance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: As evidenced by sero-epidemiological studies, infections of horses with the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) occur frequently in TBEV-endemic areas. However, there are only very few reports of clinical cases. A possible underreporting may be due to a variety of diagnostic challenges. In this study, ELISA and neutralization tests were applied to serum samples. Brain tissue samples were investigated for the presence of nucleic acids of TBEV, Equid alphaherpesvirus 1, Borna disease virus 1, West Nile and Usutu viruses, rustrela virus, as well as Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses with RT-qPCR, RT-PCR, and qPCR, respectively. TBEV-specific amplification products were subjected to Sanger sequencing. In addition, a direct fluorescent antibody test for rabies was performed. Clinical and patho-histological findings are reported. Using specific RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays, TBEV nucleic acids were demonstrated in brain tissue samples. Sequencing revealed the Western (formerly Central) European subtype of TBEV as the etiological agent. A high titer of TBEV-specific neutralizing antibodies was found in the serum. RNAscope in situ hybridization revealed TBEV RNA confined to neuronal cell bodies and processes. No other pathogens or nucleic acids thereof could be detected. Diagnostic procedures need to be carried out early after the onset of neurological signs to allow for a final etiological diagnosis of acute TBEV infections in horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Twelve adult horses were randomly assigned to 2 groups in a prospective experimental trial. A pneumatic tourniquet (425 mmHg) was placed, under sedation, proximal to the carpus on one randomly chosen thoracic limb. A cephalic vein catheter was placed distal to the tourniquet to establish an intravenous regional limb perfusion technique (IVRLP) with morphine (0.1 mg/kg) diluted with saline 0.9% to 0.1 mL/kg, and the tourniquet left in place for 30 minutes. Horses were euthanized at 1 h (Group I) or 6 h (Group II) following the IVRLP and synovial fluid from the radiocarpal, intercarpal, metacarpophalangeal, distal interphalangeal, and digital flexor tendon sheath was obtained from the injected and contralateral (control) limb immediately after. Morphine concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. An unpaired t-test was used to compare morphine concentrations from both groups (P < 0.05). Synovial morphine concentrations were detected in the injected limb in all horses in Group I, except in one horse in the radiocarpal joint, and detected in 5 of 6 horses in Group II. Mean synovial concentrations ranged between 301.8 ± 192.3 and 608 ± 446.6 ng/mL in Group I and between 27.0 ± 17.7 and 136.8 ± 103.6 ng/mL in Group II and were significantly higher in Group I between paired anatomical sites of both groups for the radiocarpal and distal interphalangeal joints, and the digital flexor tendon sheath. In conclusion, concentrations of morphine after IVRLP can be detected in synovial fluid distal to the tourniquet at 1 and 6 hours in horses. © 2023, Canadian Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Among the various zoonotic pathogens that infect horses, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Leishmania spp. have gained scientific interest, and relevant molecular and serological studies in horses have been conducted worldwide. Moreover, human and veterinary medicine have extensively applied alternatives to serum diagnostic samples—such as saliva—for detecting pathogens or antibodies. In this study, we investigated the exposure of horses in Greece to A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, and L. infantum, and we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of saliva compared to serum in detecting IgG antibodies against the abovementioned pathogens. Paired saliva and serum samples were collected from 317 horses from different regions in Greece. The paired samples were examined using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for detecting IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, and L. infantum. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were determined to assess the validity of saliva as an alternative to serum. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the optimal cut-off value for detecting antibodies against all the examined pathogens in saliva was 1/10. Higher seropositivity rates were found for B. burgdorferi (15.14%) and A. phagocytophilum (14.19%) compared to L. infantum (1.26%). The detection of IgG antibodies using IFAT in saliva samples had a good test performance compared to serum. The two sample types had a substantial to almost perfect agreement. Although the sensitivity was moderate (70.83–75.56%) in all cases, the specificity was almost perfect to perfect (99.63–100%). This study provides the first evidence that horses in Greece are exposed to A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi and confirms that the seroprevalence of L. infantum in horses in Greece remains low. Our findings suggest that saliva sampling coupled with IFAT could be successfully applied for detecting IgG antibodies against these important zoonotic pathogens in large-scale epidemiological studies in horses, at the population level, as an alternative to serum. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study is the first to provide information on the lymphocyte subpopulations in peritoneal effusions in horses. Peritoneal transudates (n = 12), peritoneal exudates (n = 6) and a pleural exudate (n = 1) were analyzed. The total nucleated cell count (TNCC), total protein (TP) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentration determined by ELISA were measured and routine cytological evaluation was performed. CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD21 positive cells were detected by flow cytometry. A higher percentage of neutrophils (P < 0.05) and higher MMP-9 (P < 0.01) levels were found in exudates. A higher percentage of macrophages (P < 0.05) and lymphocytes (P < 0.01) were found in transudates. CD4 + lymphocytes were the most common lymphocyte subpopulation in all samples. CD21 + lymphocytes were the least common in all samples. A large variability in the percentage of CD21 + lymphocytes was found in exudates. The percentage of CD21 + lymphocytes positively correlated with the level of total protein (r = 0.5704, P < 0.05). The correlation was even stronger in the group of exudates. The percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations did not correlate with the level of MMP-9 or with cytological findings. The level of MMP-9 positively correlated with the percentage of neutrophils (r = 0.4980, P < 0.05), the level of TP (r = 0.7855, P < 0.01) and TNCC (r = 0.6129, P < 0.01). A significantly higher level of MMP-9 was detected in euthanized horses than in horses that survived (P < 0.05). However, it was shown that the level of MMP-9 in the peritoneal fluid can change significantly in a short time. More studies on repeated abdominocentesis could contribute to elucidating the role of MMP-9 as a prognostic indicator. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Horse flies and deer flies are important components of habitat for many species, but how logging may alter the communities of biting flies in the boreal forest is largely unexplored. Such knowledge is important to conservation, because biting flies can shape the behaviour and sometimes even the demography of vertebrates in the boreal forest. We compared the abundance and distribution of Tabanidae species in managed boreal forest stands in northwestern Ontario with three harvest histories. Using sweep nets during 2 summers, we collected specimens from forest stands that were young (harvested 20–35 years ago), intermediate (harvested 36–69 years ago), and old (unharvested or harvested ≥ 70 years ago). We tested the hypothesis that greater harassment potential in young stands was due not only to more abundant tabanids, but more abundant obligate blood-feeding (anautogenous) tabanids, which are more persistent in host seeking. We caught 8,895 specimens from 44 species. The oldest stands had the highest species richness, but the lowest abundance of individuals, whereas young stands had the highest relative abundance and the most anautogenous specimens, potentially causing more stress to hosts in young stands. These results demonstrate that forest harvesting may reduce habitat suitability for many large mammals due to an altered tabanid community. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The relationship between helminth infection and allergic diseases has long intrigued the scientific community. This interaction was previously studied in a horse family with high incidence of severe equine asthma and in non-related severely asthmatic horses from equine hospital referrals in Switzerland. Our aim was to determine if this interaction would also be observed in a group of non-related client-owned severely asthmatic horses living in a Mediterranean climate and recruited through a first-opinion veterinarian group. Fecal samples from severe equine asthma-affected and healthy horses living in the same farms and subjected to identical environmental and deworming management were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Strongyle-type eggs and Cyathostomum sensu latum larvae were the most abundant parasites in the studied population of horses; no significant differences between the groups were observed regarding the types of egg and infective larvae. However, we observed significant differences in the number of eggs and infective larvae per gram of feces shed, as this number was significantly lower in the SEA group than in the healthy horses. This may indicate that severely asthmatic horses have an intrinsic resistance to gastrointestinal helminths. Further studies in a larger population of horses are required to ascertain the immunological mechanisms responsible for these findings. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only current intervention that has the ability to modify the immune response toward a tolerogenic state. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of AIT in horses with allergic diseases in a systematic manner. Three databases were searched to identify articles reporting clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with AIT. The articles were evaluated for beneficial responses to AIT, defined as a ≥50% reduction in clinical signs, and clinical remission. Horses with respiratory diseases, urticaria, and pruritic dermatitis receiving insect monotherapy or multi-allergen AIT were included. All adverse events were graded, and analytical and confounding biases were assessed. The results showed that multi-allergen AIT had a beneficial response in 75% of horses with respiratory diseases, 88% with urticaria, and 56% with pruritic dermatitis. However, horses treated solely with insect AIT for pruritic dermatitis had a lower response rate (36%). Self-limiting local reactions were the most common adverse events, with systemic reactions grade II accounting for 11% of reported events. Analytical and confounding biases were identified as major limitations in the available studies. Further research is needed to address these biases and provide stronger evidence on the efficacy and safety of AIT in horses with allergic diseases. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a tick-borne disease of horses caused by the intraerytrocytic protozoan parasites. The infected animals remain carriers of these blood parasites for long periods and spread the disease. The introduction of carrier animals into areas where competent tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease. Methods: Total 295 blood smears from diseased and healthy horses were examined and 295 serum samples were analyses by cELISA for the presence of antibodies against T. equi and B. caballi whereas 90 DNA samples from seropositive horses were screened by PCR for presence of parasite’s DNA. Result: In present study, 1.35% horses were found positive for T. equi by means of blood smear examination. Using c-ELISA, it was found that 03 (1.02%) horses had antibodies against B. caballi and 182 (61.69%) against T. equi, while none of the sample showed mixed reactions. Ninety (90) seropositivehorses screened for T. equi and B. caballi by PCR method, out of which, only Nine (09) horses werefound positive indicating an overall prevalence rate of T. equi was 10.00% by PCR. None ofthe horses found positive for B. caballi through blood smear examination and PCR method. © 2023 Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: A total of 166 horses of the Russian Riding breed were studied using 17 microsatellite loci recommended by ISAG. Microsatellite polymorphism data of 34 European breeds (7874 individuals) were used for comparative analysis of genetic diversity and modern clustering. The Russian Riding horse has high values of allele richness, 5.4 alleles per microsatellite locus. In total, 122 alleles were found in the breed, including the private allele 14 at the HTG7 locus. The population genetic structure of the Russian riding, Arabian, Akhal-Teke, German riding, and purebred riding breeds has been described. Clustering of horse breeds on a circular UPGMA dendrogram revealed six main clusters. The Russian riding horse grouped with the German and purebred English horses in the PCA analysis. Breeds were divided into three populations in STRUCTURE (K = 3): (1) Arabian, (2) Russian Riding, Akhal-Teke, and Thoroughbred Riding, (3) German Half-Bred. Differentiation analysis between breeds using the F st method showed the greatest values (differences) between Akhal-Teke horses and all other breeds. The smallest value (F st = 0.22) between the Russian riding and German riding breed. Pairwise differences between breeds were significant (p-value < 0.001). © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Copy number variations (CNVs) are crucial structural genomic variants affecting complex traits in humans and livestock animals. The current study was designed to conduct a comprehensive comparative copy number variation analysis among three breeds, Debao (DB), Baise (BS), and Warmblood (WB), with a specific focus on identifying genomic regions associated with miniature features in horses. Using whole-genome next-generation resequencing data, we identified 18,974 CNVs across 31 autosomes. Among the breeds, we found 4279 breed-specific CNV regions (CNVRs). Baise, Debao, and Warmblood displayed 2978, 986, and 895 distinct CNVRs, respectively, with 202 CNVRs shared across all three breeds. After removing duplicates, we obtained 1545 CNVRs from 26 horse genomes. Functional annotation reveals enrichment in biological functions, including antigen processing, cell metabolism, olfactory conduction, and nervous system development. Debao horses have 970 genes overlapping with CNVRs, possibly causing their small size and mountainous adaptations. We also found that the genes GHR, SOX9, and SOX11 may be responsible for the miniature features of the Debao horse by analyzing their overlapping CNVRs. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the widespread presence of CNVs in the horse genome. The findings contribute to mapping horse CNVs and advance research on unique miniature traits observed in the Debao horse. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: The study investigated the origin of the Akhal-Teke horse using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and mitochondrial hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1) nucleotide sequences Methods: Genome-wide SNP data from 22 breeds (481 horses) and mitochondrial HVR-1 sequences from 24 breeds (544 sequences) worldwide to examine the origin of the Akhal- Teke horse. The data were analyzed using principal component analysis, linkage disequilibrium analysis, neighbor-joining dendrograms, and ancestry inference to determine the population relationships, ancestral source, genetic structure, and relationships with other varieties. Results: A close genetic relationship between the Akhal-Teke horse and horses from the Middle East was found. Analysis of mitochondrial HVR-1 sequences showed that there were no shared haplotypes between the Akhal-Teke and Tarpan horses, and the mitochondrial data indicated that the Akhal-Teke horse has not historically expanded its group. Ancestral inference suggested that Arabian and Caspian horses were the likely ancestors of the Akhal- Teke horse. Conclusion: The Akhal-Teke horse originated in the Middle East.  © 2023 by Animal Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Water treadmill (WT) exercise may induce limb and back kinematics that meet specific training and rehabilitation goals. The study aimed to investigate the effects of walk speed, at different water depths (WDs), on limb and back kinematics of six Thoroughbreds exercising on a WT. Horses walked at 2.8/4.3/5.5/6.0 km/h (i.e. 0.8/1.2/1.5/1.7 m/s) at dry, metacarpophalangeal and carpal WD. Videography captured limb movement in the sagittal plane. Motion-capture measured thoracolumbosacral flexion-extension (FE), and lateral bend (LB) ranges of movement (ROM) using skin surface markers on the sixth, tenth, thirteenth, eighteenth thoracic, third and fifth lumbar, and third sacral spinous processes. Inertial-motion-sensors measured poll, withers and pelvic displacements. Following preliminary univariable analyses, multivariable mixed-effects linear-regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between speed, WD and each outcome variable (P < 0.05). Peak metacarpophalangeal, carpal and tarsal joint flexion increased with speed (P ≤ 0.002) and depth combined (P 0.001) while peak metatarsophalangeal flexion increased with WD only (P 0.001). Thoracolumbar FE-ROM between T10 and L3 and hindlimb retraction was increased by speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Hindlimb protraction was increased by speed (P 0.001) while hindlimb retraction was increased by speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Dorsoventral poll displacement was increased by speed (P 0.001) and carpal WD (P = 0.013), craniocaudal poll displacement was increased by speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Pelvic (tubera coxae and sacrum) dorsoventral displacements increased with speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Understanding the effects of speed and WD on limb, back and pelvic kinematics will improve decision making relating to dry and WT exercise within training. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Although the horse chestnut is not a native element of the Polish dendroflora, it is frequently planted in cities (parks, avenues, yards), and forms many road-side avenues outside of cities. At present, most horse chestnut trees display the effects of infection by the horse chestnut leaf miner (HCLM) or by the fungus Guignardia aesculi. The present study is based on a group of horse chestnut trees forming an avenue in NW Poland, in the vicinity of Krzymów. The avenue was planted in the 2nd decade of the 20th century. The trees forming the avenue are growing in a mid- -field habitat (FIELD) and in a forest habitat (FOREST), which enables a comparison among trees growing in these habitats. Dendrometric analyses were performed on 100 trees, and den- drochronological analyses were performed for 32 trees, with equal number of trees sampled in each habitat. The FIELD chronology spans 103 years (1916-2018), the FOREST chronology spans 101 years (1918-2018). Our study aimed to compare the height and crown diameter of the horse chestnut trees growing in a forest and in a mid-field habitat, to examine the rate of radial growth, and to compare the growth-climate relationships in trees from each habitat. The horse chestnut trees growing in the forest habitat are higher than those from the mid-field habitat. The crown diameter is comparable in both habitats, and the breast-height diameter (1.3 m above ground, DBH) is higher in the trees growing in the mid-field habitat. The horse chestnut trees from the mid-field habitat are healthier, their leaves are infected to a lesser extent and fall off later. Also their annual increments are wider. Also the minimum, mean and maximum tree-ring widths, and the cumulative radial growth arc higher for the mid-field habitat. We also found differences in the growth-climate relationships established for each site, especially for the year preceding growth (the analyzes were performed for temperature (T) over the period 1948-2018, for precipitation (P) over the period 1951-2018 and for sunshine duration (SD) over the period 1965-2018). For the trees growing in the mid-field habitat, air temperature and sunshine duration for July and August of the previous year are highly significant (negative correlation). Precipitation (positive correlation) and sunshine duration (negative correlation) in September of the year preceding growth are significant for the forest trees. These differences may result from the disparate features of the studied habitats, and the contrasting intensity of tree infestation by HCLM and by the fungus G. aesculi.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study was designed to determine the effect of PPG and/or flunixin meglumine on SAA response when used at clinical dosing regimens in healthy adult horses. Six healthy adult horses were enrolled in a crossover study design including one control and three treatment groups: no treatment (control); PPG alone (intramuscularly q12h for 72h); flunixin meglumine alone (intravenously q24h for 72h); and PPG (intramuscularly q12h for 72h) and flunixin meglumine (intravenously q24h for 72h). Whole blood was collected at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-initial drug administration to measure SAA using a commercial lateral-flow immunoassay. The washout period was 30 days. Individual SAA values were within the reference range (≤ 20 µg/mL) for almost all horses in the control group. One control horse displayed a SAA value of 28 µg/mL at 72 hours. All horses from the PPG group showed normal SAA values throughout the study. Apart from one horse (SAA of 24 µg/mL at 96 hours) from the flunixin meglumine group, all horses showed normal SAA values. For the PPG and flunixin meglumine group, 5 horses had SAA values within reference range. One horse displayed increased SAA values (32-45 µg/mL) between 48 to 96 hours post-drug administration. There was no difference in area under the SAA time curve amongst control and treatment groups (P > 0.05). The administration of intramuscular PPG and/or intravenous flunixin meglumine does not trigger an inflammatory response that induces a SAA value above reference range in most adult healthy horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: In this study, horse stable waste (horse manure, peat and wood sawdust) was pro-cessed under pyrolytic conditions. The chemical and physical properties of biochar obtained from different mixtures of horse stable residues were compared. All mea-surements followed an experimental design using a mixture model. This approach allowed the properties of any combination of ingredients to be predicted and the influence of each component on the final value to be estimated, with very good agreement between predicted and observed values. The results of the analysis of pH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), specific surface area (SSA) and CHNSO (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen) showed that all possible combinations of materials can be used as soil amendments, since: an alkaline pH (>7) pre-vents soil acidification and a concentration of PAH below the limit (ΣPAH<12mg/kg) does not pose a risk to human health. A high SSA value (>180 m2/g) and a different particle size distribution (PSD) provide habitat for microorganisms, increase water retention capacity and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the soil. © 2023 Cisa Publisher.

ABSTRACT: Free-ranging grazers are increasingly being introduced to areas of high natural value, such as wetlands. There is also growing attention that has been paid to the historical role of herbivores in shaping ecosystems and landscapes. Even though studies on the grazing of free-range horses were carried out in different regions and climates, still little is known about their habitat selection on heterogeneous marshy areas in the temperate region of Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use by contemporary Konik horses during the growing season on the basis of three-year GPS data for a semi-feral herd kept on wetlands. Almost 68% of the occurrence of Konik horses were in open habitats. The assessment of habitat selection by the horses confirmed their strong preferences for grasslands on mid-forest dunes and forest avoidance. Konik horses somewhat preferred mowed fen meadows, but the animals displayed differences in the selection of habitat, probably depending on its humidity and weather conditions in a given year which may limit the role of grazing in protecting these communities. Horses need different habitats in wetlands such as fen meadows, forest, and grasslands on the mineral hills. This should be taken into consideration for landscape management in areas where the introduction of wild or semi-wild horse populations is planned. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase (HLADH) has been immobilized on calcium-alginate beads and used for both oxidation and reduction reactions. To avoid swelling of the beads and their subsequent breakage, calcium ions were added to both reaction and storage solutions, allowing the beads to maintain the initial structural features. The techniques used for this purpose revealed that 2 mM Ca2+ is the optimal concentration, which does not significantly change the weight of the beads, the amount of water in them, and their external and internal structure. The optimized experimental procedure has been used to verify the properties of the enzyme in terms of reusability, storage, and thermal stability. The addition of calcium ions allows the enzyme to retain more than 80 % of its initial activity for fourteen cycles and approximately 50 % at the twentieth cycle. Moreover, when the biocatalyst has been stored in a buffer solution containing 2 mM Ca2+, the retention of enzyme activity after 30 days was 100 %, compared to that measured before incubation. The encapsulated enzyme exhibits greater thermal stability than free HLADH up to at least 60 °C, preventing dimer dissociation into the two subunits. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The sea horse is a source of multiple benefits, as souvenirs, traditional medicine, and ornamental fish. The increasing need for seahorses has resulted in massive exploitation, causing habitat degradation and even causing the extinction of several seahorse species. This study aimed to analyze the population and distribution mapping of seahorses found in the waters of Morotai Island. The research was carried out in the waters of Morotai Island and it was conducted from June 2022 to July 2023 in 6 (six) districts, namely; South Morotai, South West Morotai, Rao Island, East Morotai, North Morotai, and Morotai Jaya. Data in this study was related to the populations analysis and to their distribution mapping at the study site. Based on the research results, the distribution of seahorses was determined at the 6 (six) research locations, showing a spread across South Morotai waters. © 2023, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Cyathostominae are ubiquitous to grazing horses and regarded the most prevalent internal parasite in the horse. Unfortunately, decades of indiscriminate use of anthelmintic drugs have resulted in the development of resistance in cyathostomins to all currently available drug groups, the most recent being a documented lack of efficacy to the macrocyclic lactones (ML). In vivo determination of anthelmintic resistance in horses most often utilises the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). Further, a shortened egg reappearance period (ERP) can indicate a change in response to the applied treatment and suggest an upcoming reduction of efficacy. Although both true resistance as demonstrated by the FECRT and shorter ERPs after ML treatment have now been shown in cyathostomins worldwide, the efficacy of ML as regards to cyathostomins in Sweden is currently unknown. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine FECRTs and ERPs after ivermectin (IVM) treatment in Swedish horses. Sixteen equestrian establishments with a minimum of six horses excreting at least 150 eggs per gram faeces (EPG) at screening were selected. For each establishment, FECRTs and ERPs were determined by collecting faecal samples prior to and 14 days after IVM treatment (200 µg/kg), and thereafter at weekly intervals for a total of eight weeks. All participants responded to a questionnaire detailing pasture management methods and anthelmintic routines.Questionnaire results showed that the majority of establishments (69%) only treated horses with anthelmintic drugs if indicated by faecal diagnostics and all of the establishments had a mean FECRT exceeding 99.0% and ERPs ranging from six to over eight weeks. The ERP was shown to increase with age as young individuals were shown to excrete cyathostomin eggs earlier after treatment compared with older horses (R = 0.21, p = 0.015). Riding schools, stud farms and those declaring not to use separate summer and winter paddocks had significantly shorter ERPs (p <0.01).In conclusion, retained ERPs and no confirmed resistance to IVM were found in Swedish equine establishments practising selective anthelmintic treatment, and supports the use of selective deworming regimens as a means of reducing the risk of anthelmintic resistance development. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Strangulating small intestinal disease (SSID) in horses carries a poor prognosis for survival, especially following resection of ischaemic tissue. The margins of a resection are principally based on visual appraisal of the intestine during surgery. We hypothesized that histological evaluation of resected tissue may identify occult changes indicative of prognosis. Small intestinal samples from 18 horses undergoing resection for SSID and 9 horses euthanised for reasons unrelated to gastrointestinal pathology were utilised. Histological appearance was used to generate a ‘total damage score’ (TDS) for the control tissue, grossly normal tissue at oral and aboral extremities (sections OR1 and AB1) of the resected intestine, and oral and aboral extremities of visually abnormal tissue (sections OR2 and AB2) from SSID horses. The relationship between TDS and long-term post-operative survival was investigated. TDS was not different between control tissues and OR1 and AB1 sections. Five surgical cases were alive at follow-up, the longest follow-up time being 2561 days. Based on the median scores for SSID cases versus controls, cut-off values were generated to evaluate post-operative survival versus TDS. Only OR2 TDS was significantly associated with survival, with a higher (worse) score indicating longer survival. More severe tissue insult may expedite rapid progression to surgery, improving post-operative outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The investigation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) has received considerable interest in regenerative medicine. A nontoxic adipogenic induction protocol valid for cells of different mammalian species has not been described. This study aims to establish an adipogenic differentiation protocol suitable for horses, sheep, dogs, murines, and human cells. An optimized rosiglitazone protocol, consisting of 5% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, 10 μg/mL insulin, 0.55 μg/mL transferrin, 6.8 ng sodium selenite, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 1–5 μM of rosiglitazone, is compared to the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX) protocol, where rosiglitazone was replaced with 0.5 mM IBMX and 0.2 mM indomethacin. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, a morphometric analysis of the lipid, and the expression of adipogenic markers for 14 days were assessed. The data revealed that using 5 µM of rosiglitazone promotes the adipogenic differentiation capacity in horse, sheep, and dog cells compared to IBMX induction. Meanwhile, marked reductions in the cell viability and cell number with the IBMX protocol were detected, and rosiglitazone increased the cell number and lipid droplet size, prevented apoptosis, and upregulated FABP-4 and Leptin expression in the cells of most of the species. Our data revealed that the rosiglitazone protocol improves the adipogenesis of ASCs, together with having less toxicity, and should be considered for cell reproducibility and clinical applications targeting obesity. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Brachybacterium species have been identified in various ecological niches and belong to the family Dermabacteriaceae within the phylum Actinobacteria. In this study, we isolated a novel Brachybacterium equifaecis JHP9 strain from horse feces and compared its kinetic, biochemical, and genomic features with those of other Brachybacterium strains. Moreover, comparative genomic analysis using publicly available Brachybacterium genomes was performed to determine the properties involved in their ecological adaptation and metabolic potential. Novel species delineation was determined phylogenetically through 16S rRNA gene similarity (up to 97.9%), average nucleotide identity (79.5–82.5%), average amino acid identity (66.7–75.8%), and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (23.7–27.9) using closely related strains. This study also presents the first report of the kinetic properties of Brachybacterium species. Most of the Brachybacterium strains displayed high oxygen (Km(app) =1.6–24.2 µM) and glucose (Km(app) =0.73–1.22 µM) affinities, which may manifest niche adaptations. Various carbohydrate metabolisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, carbohydrate-active enzymes, lactic acid production, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas and bacteriophage exclusion systems were observed in the genotypic and/or phenotypic properties of Brachybacterium species, suggesting their genome flexibility, defense mechanisms, and adaptability. Our study contributes to the knowledge of the kinetic, physiological, and genomic properties of Brachybacterium species, including the novel JHP9 strain, which advocates for their tolerant and thriving nature in various environments, leading to their ecological adaptation. IMPORTANCE Basic physiological and genomic properties of most of the Brachybacterium isolates have been studied; however, the ability of this bacterium to adapt to diverse environments, which may demonstrate its role in niche differentiation, is to be identified yet. Therefore, here, we explored cellular kinetics, metabolic diversity, and ecological adaptation/defensive properties of the novel Brachybacterium strain through physiological and comparative genomic analysis. In addition, we presented the first report examining Brachybacterium kinetics, indicating that all strains of Brachybacterium, including the novel one, have high oxygen and glucose affinity. Furthermore, the comparative genomic analysis also revealed that the novel bacterium contains versatile genomic properties, which provide the novel bacterium with significant competitive advantages. Thus, in-depth genotypic and phenotypic analysis with kinetic properties at the species level of this genus is beneficial in clarifying its differential characteristics, conferring the ability to inhabit diverse ecological niches.

ABSTRACT: High progesterone concentrations in the early luteal phase support pregnancy, whereas subphysiological progesterone concentrations delay embryonic development at least until placentation. In this study, fetal growth and development of pregnancy was investigated in pregnancies with prostaglandin F2α-induced low progesterone concentrations (PGF) in the early luteal phase and control pregnancies (CON) in the same mares (n = 12). Mares were inseminated and in PGF pregnancies received the prostaglandin F2α analogue cloprostenol (62.5 µg) on days 0–3 after ovulation to induce subphysiological progesterone concentrations; CON pregnancies remained untreated. Mares were assigned to PGF or CON treatments in alternating order and received the opposite treatment in the following year. Blood was collected and conceptus size determined repeatedly by transrectal (≤day 101) and transabdominal (>day 101) ultrasonography. After birth, foals were weighed, measured and submitted to a clinical examination. Treatment PGF resulted in fewer pregnancies than CON treatment. All foals born from CON pregnancies were healthy and mature, whereas 4/7 PGF pregnancies were either lost (one embryonic death, one abortion) or resulted in the birth of compromised foals (P = 0.018). Size of the conceptus (e.g., diameter day 49: PGF 6.6 ± 0.7, CON 7.7 ± 0.7 cm, P = 0.006) and embryo proper (e.g., crown rump length day 54; PGF 4.4 ± 0.8, CON 5.8 ± 0.6 cm, P = 0.015) differed between treatments. These size differences decreased over time and at birth PGF foals did not differ significantly from CON foals. In conclusion, reduced progesterone concentration in the early luteal phase leads to delayed conceptus growth beyond placentation and increased pregnancy loss. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug specifically formulated for veterinary medicine and selectively acts on inhibiting the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme (COX-2). This study evaluated the possible adverse effects of administering oral therapeutic firocoxib on gastric mucosa, hematological parameters, coagulation cascade, and hepatic and renal biochemistry in healthy horses. Nine clinically healthy Arabian horses, approximately 9 years old, received 0.1 mg/kg of oral firocoxib for 14 days. The gastroscopic examination was conducted 1 day before starting treatment (D0) and two days after the last blood collection (D23). Venous blood samples were obtained for laboratory tests on day 1, immediately prior to the initiation of treatment (D1), after 7 and 14 days of treatment (D7 and D14), and 7 days after the conclusion of treatment (D21. No changes were found in the gastroscopic and hematological tests. Coagulation and serum biochemistry levels remain between these species’ average values. However, the increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) indicate reduced blood coagulation capacity, which contradicts the expected effect of treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors, as these drugs theoretically promote coagulation. Administering firocoxib to horses is safe as it does not cause significant adverse reactions. Therefore, it is a suitable option for managing inflammatory conditions in these animals with attention to an unexpected adverse anti-coagulopathy effect, and further study is warranted. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Leishmaniosis is a zoonosis caused by Leishmania spp., an intracellular protozoan parasite. This parasite is transmitted by sandflies, and the disease is endemic in the Mediterranean basin. In recent years, the number of species which could be a reservoir of the parasite is increased. One of the most relevant species is the horse, due to their contact with humans and ability to control the disease, thus being a possible silent reservoir. In this study, we have analyzed the prevalence and factors related to L. infantum infection in healthy horses in the Mediterranean region. Epidemiological data and serum samples were obtained from 167 apparently healthy horses, and the presence of L. infantum was evaluated via the ELISA method and real-time PCR. The results show 27.5% of prevalence and that the main factors related to infection are equine breed, morphotype, outdoor living, use, and season. In conclusion, the prevalence of L. infantum infection in apparently healthy horses from eastern Spain (Mediterranean basin) is elevated. To control this zoonosis, it would be advisable to carry out more studies on this and other species that could be silent reservoirs of the parasite, as well as carry out measures such as the use of repellents on a regular basis. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Urination in transponder-controlled roughage feeding stations is a widespread undesirable behaviour of group-housed horses. Urination on hard surfaces, such as the floor of the stations, is contrary to the natural elimination behaviour of horses because they prefer to urinate on soft, absorbent surfaces, and it increases ammonia emissions around the stations. The following aspects were analysed: a) urination as potential displacement activity during feed anticipation, b) absence of appropriate elimination areas in the stable and c) ammonia odour as a trigger stimulus. We observed a group of 33 horses in three different situations: 1) baseline situation, 2) provision of elimination areas containing an absorbent substrate in front of the feeding stations and 3) neutralisation of ammonia odour in the feeding stations. In the baseline situation all horses were observed, regardless whether they urinated in the feeding station or not. In the other two situations, only the urinating-horses were observed. We analysed 5 h of video per day, recorded on 4 days from seven feeding stations in each situation. We used an information theory approach, calculating three different (generalized) linear mixed effects models and all according sub-models. In the baseline situation, the horses showed that the horses urinated often after ‘ground exploration’, and there was more ground exploration in the urinating-horses than in the non-urinating-horses. In addition, a higher percentage of the mares than of the geldings urinated during at least one station visit, and mares urinated more often per visit than geldings. Before urination, the horses in most cases lowered the head toward the hay container to trigger the sensor and cause the station to open the partition and make the hay accessible. The time span between lowering the head and access to feed could be perceived as too long by the horses (maximum duration: 30 s) and lead to urination as a displacement activity. In addition, urination never occurred when the hay was accessible, only when the hay was inaccessible, closed, opening or closing. This leads us to conclude that urination is related to feed anticipation. The frequency of urination bouts was not reduced by installing additional elimination areas or neutralising the urine odour, so additional elimination areas and urine odour do not seem to have a role in the undesirable behaviour. Further research is needed to investigate a displacement activity or a classical conditioning in more detail to prevent urination by horses in automated feeding stations. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This article presents the results of an electrocardiographic study of English thoroughbred racehorses with cardiac pathologies. Diagnosis was performed on 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old horses before and after exercise. It was noted that tachycardia and various cardiac abnormalities were observed in many animals. Currently, there is an increase in the number of pathologies related to the cardiovascular system diagnosed in sport horses, which can lead to early culling of the animal and reduce the economic efficiency of their maintenance. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2023.

ABSTRACT: A 6-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was evaluated for surgical treatment of a firm, nonpainful cervical mass. The mass developed over 9 months but began enlarging rapidly 4 months prior to presentation. Previous biopsies were inconclusive. Ultrasonography of the cranioventral neck identified a heterogenous, 20 cm × 9 cm × 10 cm mass separate from the thyroid gland and extending caudally from the level of the hyoid apparatus. The gelding was clinically healthy at presentation. Surgical resection of the mass was performed under general anaesthesia. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry staining revealed an undifferentiated sarcoma with incomplete margins. Diagnostic staging tests, re-excision and adjuvant chemotherapy were recommended, but the horse died suddenly before further treatment could be pursued. Post-mortem examination revealed a recurrent cranioventral cervical mass in addition to haemothorax and widespread intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal multiorgan metastasis. To the authors' knowledge, this report documents the first undifferentiated sarcoma with systemic metastatic disease resulting in the sudden death of a young horse. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In Sweden, routine deworming has been used for several decades; however, to slow down the development of anthelmintic resistance, selective treatment is currently recommended. As part of a monitoring programme, equestrian premises submitted faecal samples to the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) twice per year between 2008 and 2017. Analyses for strongyles (small and large), tapeworms and ascarids, followed by premise-specific advice regarding deworming and parasite control strategies, were provided. In total, 43,330 faecal samples, collected from 26,625 horses on 935 premises in springtime (March to June), were analysed by quantitative or semi-quantitative flotation. Moreover, Strongylus vulgaris was detected by larval culture or PCR. Between 4 and 11% of individual horses tested positive for S. vulgaris and 3–10% were shedding tapeworm eggs. There were recurrent high and low egg shedders; 75% of horses with S. vulgaris appeared to have been recently introduced into the herd; the proportion of S. vulgaris-positive premises increased when individual samples rather than pooled samples were used. Based on the results of S. vulgaris diagnostics and strongyle egg-shedding level, 59% of the horses did not need to be dewormed. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The horse industry today in Europe is an increasing leisure or sporting activity. Due to considerable input of nutrients via dung and urine, horse paddocks can be significant sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) and reactive nitrogen (N)-gases. However, horse paddocks have not been studied intensively in contrast to e.g., dairy cow pastures. Here we report GHG emissions from one selected horse paddock in Eastern Finland. During the first year, GHG emissions from the site and surrounding grassland area were measured with closed static chamber method. In the following year soil samples were taken from the sites to study GHG emission and reactive N-gas (nitrous acid and nitric oxide) emissions in the laboratory. The paddock area emitted significant amounts of N-gases and methane compared with surrounding areas during wet season. N-gas emissions also increased with increasing soil mineral N concentration. We conclude that horse paddocks can be significant but local sources of greenhouse gases and wet soil conditions should be avoided to mitigate the emissions. © 2023 Nihon University School of Dentistry.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory disease is common in the horse population and is often associated with poor performance in equine athletes. Despite their outstanding strength and aerobic capacity, little regard is given to draft horses and the respiratory disorders they may encounter when performing athletic activity. For this reason, the objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the prevalence of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), tracheal mucus (TM) and recurrent laryngeal hemiplegia (RLH) in a population of competitive draft pulling horses, and (2) to determine if there was an association between horse weight, height, age, amount pulled, or competition placing with EIPH, TM or RLH in draft pullers. Results of this study identified EIPH in 26% of the study population, RLH in 32% and TM in 82% of participating horses; however, no risk factors were identified for the development of these problems in draft pulling horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: After 25 years of studies on methodologies for behavioral assessment of equine pain, the Unesp-Botucatu Horse Acute Pain Scale (UHAPS) and the Orthopedic Composite Pain Scale (CPS) were recently considered suboptimal instruments to assess pain in hospitalized horses. However, the combination of the two instruments has never been examined. The objective was to investigate whether the merging, mining, and weighting of UHAPS and CPS behavioral items in a single instrument using a predictive model could improve the capacity to diagnose pain in horses. A previously video-collected behavioral database of 42 horses admitted to three different hospitals for orthopedic or soft tissue surgery was used. Multilevel binomial logistic regression models were used to merge, mine, and weight the behaviors of both instruments. The classification quality between the model and the instruments was compared by the area under the curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval. The short model containing 25% of the behaviors of the two instruments showed a higher AUC (98.64 [98.16 – 99.12]; p < 0.0001) than the UHAPS (84.63 [82.08 – 87.18]) and CPS (88.62 [86.56 – 90.66]), independently. We conclude that merging, mining, and weighting the UHAPS and CPS behavior items into a single predictive model appears to be a promising strategy to improve pain diagnostic skill and promote equine welfare. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Fissure in the third metacarpal/tarsal parasagittal groove and proximal phalanx sagittal groove is a potential prodromal pathology of fracture; therefore, early identification and characterisation of fissures using non-invasive imaging could be of clinical value. Thirty-three equine cadaver limbs underwent standing cone-beam (CB) computed tomography (CT), fan-beam (FB) CT, low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and macro/histo-pathological examination. Imaging diagnoses of fissures were compared to microscopic examination. Imaging features of fissures were described. Histopathological findings were scored and compared between locations with and without fissures on CT. Microscopic examination identified 114/291 locations with fissures. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 88.5% and 61.3% for CBCT, 84.1% and 72.3% for FBCT, and 43.6% and 85.2% for MRI. Four types of imaging features of fissures were characterised on CT: (1) CBCT/FBCT hypoattenuating linear defects, (2) CBCT/FBCT striated hypoattenuated lines, (3) CBCT/FBCT subchondral irregularity, and (4) CBCT striated hypoattenuating lines and FBCT subchondral irregularity. Fissures on MRI appeared as subchondral bone hypo-/hyperintense defects. Microscopic scores of subchondral bone sclerosis, microcracks, and collapse were significantly higher in locations with CT-identified fissures. All imaging modalities were able to identify fissures. Fissures identified on CT were associated with histopathology of fatigue injuries. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Feral horse (Equus caballus) population management is a challenging problem around the world because populations often exhibit density-independent growth, can exert negative ecological effects on ecosystems, and require great cost to be managed. However, strong value-based connections between people and horses cause contention around management decisions. To help make informed decisions, natural resource managers might benefit from more detailed understanding of how horse management alternatives, including combinations of removals and fertility control methods, could achieve objectives of sustainable, multiple-use ecosystems while minimizing overall horse handling and fiscal costs. Here, we describe a modeling tool that simulates horse management alternatives and estimates trade-offs in predicted metrics related to population size, animal handling, and direct costs of management. The model considers six management actions for populations (removals for adoption or long-term holding; fertility control treatment with three vaccines, intrauterine devices, and mare sterilization), used alone or in combination. We simulated 19 alternative management scenarios at 2-, 3-, and 4-year management return intervals and identified efficiency frontiers among alternatives for trade-offs between predicted population size and six management metrics. Our analysis identified multiple alternatives that could maintain populations within target population size ranges, but some alternatives (e.g., removal and mare sterilization, removal and GonaCon treatment) performed better at minimizing overall animal handling requirements and management costs. Cost savings increased under alternatives with more effective, longer lasting fertility control techniques over longer management intervals compared with alternatives with less-effective, shorter lasting fertility control techniques. We built a user-friendly website application, PopEquus, that decision makers and interested individuals can use to simulate management alternatives and evaluate trade-offs among management and cost metrics. Our results and website application provide quantitative trade-off tools for horse population management decisions and can help support value-based management decisions for wild or feral horse populations and ecosystems at local and regional scales around the world. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The measurement of the blood insulin concentration, and comparison to cut-offs, is essential in diagnosing insulin dysregulation, a common equine endocrinopathy. However, different insulin assays provide disparate results. We aimed to ease comparison between assays by compiling original and published data into a web app to convert insulin measurements from one assay to another. Data were available for ADVIA Centaur insulin chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), Beckman Coulter insulin radioimmunoassay (RIA), Immulite 1000 CLIA, Immulite 2000 CLIA, Immulite 2000 XPi CLIA, Mercodia equine insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Millipore porcine insulin RIA. Linear models were fitted for 13 assay pairs using non-decreasing splines, and integrated into this app. Assay comparisons including data from several studies showed a lower performance. This indicates technical variation between laboratories, which has not been described before, but is relevant when diagnostic measurements and cut-offs are provided by different laboratories. Nevertheless, the models’ overall high performance (median r2 = 0.94; range 0.57–1.00) supports their use to interpret results from diagnostic insulin measurements when the reference assay is unavailable, and to compare values obtained from different assays. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Studies were conducted to study the effect of the feed additive ProVetin on the physiological and biochemical parameters of horses. The beneficial effect of the feed additive on the hematological and biochemical profile of the blood of horses was noted. Depending on the dose of the feed additive, the activation of the body's defense mechanisms and energy metabolism is established. In the group of animals receiving a feed additive at a dose of 20 g per head, 45 days after the start of administration, an increase in the level of hemoglobin and erythrocytes relative to the initial level was noted – by 1.6% (142.4 ±13.9 g / l, P < 0.05) and 6.9% (9.3± 0.8 x1012 / l, P < 0.05) accordingly. In horses treated with ProVetin at a dose of 30 g per head, after 1.5 months, hemoglobin increased by 1% (146.9±12.2 g/l, P < 0.05), the number of red blood cells by 2.1% (9.0±1.4x1012/l), total protein by 16% (76.6±6.0 g/ll, P ≤ 0.05), albumins by 19% (38.4±2.6 g/l, P ≤ 0.05). © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Horses (Equus ferus caballus) engage their sense of smell in numerous behaviors. However, only few studies so far evaluated responses of horses to olfactory stimuli presumed to be either attractive or aversive and rather focused on presenting horses with only one type of odor. Therefore, we assessed behavioral responses of horses towards seven natural odors that are either potentially threatening, or socially attractive, or socially aversive. To this end, we presented a total of 10 horses with the following odors: same-sex and opposite-sex horse feces; same-sex and opposite-sex horse urine; tiger (Panthera tigris) feces and urine; and horse blood attached to one of two simultaneously presented food buckets and recorded their behavior. We found that the horses displayed clear behavioral reactions towards potentially threatening odors (tiger feces and urine; horse blood) compared to socially attractive (opposite-sex feces and urine) and, in some cases, socially aversive (same-sex feces and urine) odors. More precisely, the horses put their ears back significantly more frequently and tended to do it for longer in the potentially threatening odor condition compared to the socially attractive one. In the potentially threatening odor condition, the horses ate from the control bucket significantly more frequently compared to the other two conditions. Detailed analyses showed that the horses’ behavioral responses were particularly pronounced following exposure to tiger feces and urine. Furthermore, we found that, in some situations, socially aversive odor stimuli caused higher vigilance and more cautious approach, as reflected in increased time of sniffing the odor-bearing bucket and decreased frequency of eating from it in the socially aversive compared to the potentially threatening odor condition. These findings suggest that horses, which are known as prey and social animals, are sensitive to social odors and even more so to odors from predators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate corneal sensitivity and adverse events following subconjunctival administration of three local anesthetics in horses. Study design: Randomized, masked, crossover study. Animals: Twelve healthy adult mares. Methods: The subconjunctival space of the treated eye was injected with 0.2 mL of liposomal bupivacaine (1.3%), ropivacaine (0.5%), or mepivacaine (2%). All horses received each medication once and the contralateral eye received saline (control). Corneal touch threshold (CTT) was measured using a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer before sedation, after sedation, and at specified intervals until it returned to baseline. Ocular examinations were performed at 24-, 72, and 168 h post-injection to monitor for adverse effects. Results: The mean total time of anesthesia (TTA) was 168.3 min for ropivacaine, 169.2 min for liposomal bupivacaine, 103.3 min for mepivacaine and 30.7 min for the control. TTA for liposomal bupivacaine (p <.001) and ropivacaine (p =.001) was longer than the control. TTA for mepivacaine was not different from the control (p =.138), liposomal bupivacaine (p =.075) or ropivacaine (p =.150). Injection site hemorrhage reduced TTA regardless of treatments (p =.047). No adverse effects attributed to injections were noted. Conclusion: All three medications were well tolerated. Subconjunctival administration of ropivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine resulted in longer TTAs compared to the control; however, their TTAs were not different from that of mepivacaine. Clinical significance: Subconjunctivally administered liposomal bupivacaine and ropivacaine are viable options to provide prolonged corneal analgesia in horses. Future studies are needed to assess the efficacy in diseased eyes. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: The emerging global problems of microplastics pollution and their co-occurrence with other pollutants have presented major new challenges for environmental health and protection. This study used column experiments to investigate the co-transport behavior and Trojan-horse effect of colloidal microplastics (non-functional polystyrene microspheres (MS), carboxyl-modified polystyrene microspheres (CMS) and sulfonate-modified polystyrene microspheres (SMS)) and lead (Pb) in porous media. Results showed that a Trojan-horse effect occurred during the co-transport of colloidal microplastics and Pb. In the process of co-transport, colloidal microplastics and Pb mutually inhibited each other's transport at an ionic strength of 1 mM, which may be due to Pb absorption by microplastics, resulting in the destabilization of agglomerates and a reduction in the electronegativity of microplastics. At an ionic strength of 100 mM, colloidal microplastics and Pb promoted each other's transport, potentially due to their competition for adsorption in porous media. The functional groups present on colloidal microplastics inhibited the transport of Pb at low ionic strengths, while at high ionic strengths Pb transport was promoted. Furthermore, deposition experiments verified that quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring could effectively account for and predict the transport and deposition behavior of microplastics in the presence or absence of Pb. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Summary: Information regarding the behavior of different diseases in geriatric equines is scarce, including the ones related to the locomotor system, which is essential to the animal’s performance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the different types of alterations in the metacarpophalangeal joint (fetlock) in the thoracic limbs of geriatric equines and the frequency of which they occur. Furthermore, it was aimed to evaluate the scores of such lesions and their correlation to clinical manifestations. In this study, 39 mixed-breed equines were evaluated, all at a minimum age of 15 years (18,9±2,86 years old). Of those, 21 were females (53,8%) and 18 were geldings (46,2%). A clinical examination specific to the locomotor system was performed, followed by ultrasonographic and radiographic imaging of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thoracic limb. For every image obtained, a scoring system was applied in accordance to the severity of the found lesion, such as in the radiographic image (0–4) and in the ultrasonographic image of the soft tissue (0–6) and bone (0–4). Thirteen equines (35%) presented lameness, out of which three (10%) were sourced in the metacarpophalangeal joint and 10 (25%) in other painful sites. All animals (39/39) showed alterations in the metacarpophalangeal joint through ultrasound evaluation and 35 (90%) and 38 (98%) in radiographic evaluation. Considering the injury scoring system for soft tissue, 46 of 78 forelimbs (46/78; 59%) were scored 0; 5/78 (6%) were scored 1; 4/78 (5%) were scored 2; scores 3 and 4 were not observed within the group; 21/78 (26%) were scored 5 and 3/78 (4%) were scored 6. For the scoring system for ultrasonographic alteration in bones, 22/78 (27,5%) were scored 0; 19/78 (23,8%) were scored 1; 32/78 (40%) were scored 2; 6/78 (7,5%) were scored 3 and 1/78 (1,3%) were scored 4. As for the radiographic evaluation, considering both limbs 2/78 (2,5%) were scored 0; 19/78 (23,8%) were scored 1; 13/78 (16,2%) were scored 2, 43/78 (53,8%) were scored 3 and 3/78 (3,7%) were scored 4. The main alterations observed in the study were related to degenerative chronic joint diseases. There was no relationship between the presence of lameness and the scores based on the image´s analysis.

ABSTRACT: Introduction/objectives: Echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in horses is usually based on Doppler interrogation of tricuspid (TR) or pulmonic regurgitation (PR). This study aimed at investigating two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) variables, including pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and pulmonary artery distensibility index (PADI), to diagnose PH. Animals, materials and methods: 41 healthy horses; 82 horses with TR or PR and normal intracardiac pressure gradients; and 35 horses with TR or PR velocities indicating PH. The 2DE variables were compared between groups, cut-offs for the diagnosis of PH were determined, and conditional inference trees served to identify the variable best predicting PH in the absence of TR or PR. Results: Horses with PH had larger end-diastolic cross-sectional (short-axis) PAD (PADed-sx) (5.8 ± 1.0 cm; mean ± SD) and smaller PADI[/PADps] (15.4 ± 7.7%) than healthy horses (5.0 ± 0.6 cm, P<0.0001; 20.5 ± 4.4%, P<0.001) and horses with TR or PR but no PH (5.3 ± 0.6 cm, P=0.003; 18.8 ± 4.2%, P=0.005). PADed-sx predicted PH with sensitivity (Se) = 36% and specificity (Sp) = 94% (cut-off 6.0 cm, AUC = 0.668, P=0.002), while PADI[/PADps] predicted PH with Se = 43% and Sp = 92% (cut-off 13.7%, AUC = 0.662, P=0.004). In the absence of TR, PADed-sx and the end-diastolic long-axis aortic diameter-to-PADed-sx ratio (AoDed-lx/PADed-sx) were most suitable to diagnose PH. Conclusion: PADed-sx and PADI were moderately specific but not very sensitive to diagnosing PH. Nonetheless, they may be used as complementary indices suggesting PH in the absence of TR or PR. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The glutathione transferase A3-3 (GST A3-3) homodimeric enzyme is the most efficient enzyme that catalyzes isomerization of the precursors of testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in the gonads of humans and horses. However, the presence of GST A3-3 orthologs with equally high ketosteroid isomerase activity has not been verified in other mammalian species, even though pig and cattle homologs have been cloned and studied. Identifying GSTA3 genes is a challenge because of multiple GSTA gene duplications (e.g., 12 in the human genome); consequently, the GSTA3 gene is not annotated in most genomes. To improve our understanding of GSTA3 gene products and their functions across diverse mammalian species, we cloned homologs of the horse and human GSTA3 mRNAs from the testes of a dog, goat, and gray short-tailed opossum, the genomes of which all currently lack GSTA3 gene annotations. The resultant novel GSTA3 mRNA and inferred protein sequences had a high level of conservation with human GSTA3 mRNA and protein sequences (≥70% and ≥64% identities, respectively). Sequence conservation was also apparent for the 12 residues of the “H-site” in the 222 amino acid GSTA3 protein that is known to interact with the steroid substrates. Modeling predicted that the dog GSTA3-3 may be a more active ketosteroid isomerase than the corresponding goat or opossum enzymes. However, expression of the GSTA3 gene was higher in liver than in other dog tissue. Our results improve understanding of the active sites of mammalian GST A3-3 enzymes, inhibitors of which might be useful for reducing steroidogenesis for medical purposes, such as fertility control or treatment of steroid-dependent diseases. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Micro/nanorobots are promising for a wide range of biomedical applications (such as targeted tumor, thrombus, and infection therapies in hard-to-reach body sites) because of their tiny size and high maneuverability through the actuation of external fields (e.g., magnetic field, light, ultrasound, electric field, and/or heat). However, fully synthetic micro/nanorobots as foreign objects are susceptible to phagocytosis and clearance by diverse phagocytes. To address this issue, researchers have attempted to develop various cytomembrane-camouflaged micro/nanorobots by two means: (1) direct coating of micro/nanorobots with cytomembranes derived from living cells and (2) the swallowing of micro/nanorobots by living immunocytes via phagocytosis. The camouflaging with cytomembranes or living immunocytes not only protects micro/nanorobots from phagocytosis, but also endows them with new characteristics or functionalities, such as prolonging propulsion in biofluids, targeting diseased areas, or neutralizing bacterial toxins. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent advances and developments of cytomembrane-camouflaged medical micro/nanorobots. We first discuss how cytomembrane coating nanotechnology has been employed to engineer synthetic nanomaterials, and then we review in detail how cytomembrane camouflage tactic can be exploited to functionalize micro/nanorobots. We aim to bridge the gap between cytomembrane-cloaked micro/nanorobots and nanomaterials and to provide design guidance for developing cytomembrane-camouflaged micro/nanorobots. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An 18-year-old Hanoverian Warmblood gelding was presented with a history of acute haematuria. On rectal examination, a severely dilated right ureter with a concrement was palpated. Transabdominal sonography raised the suspicion of right kidney enlargement and loss of normal architecture. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed to evaluate the diagnostic findings. The tentative plan was to perform a laparoscopic ureterolith removal and a hand-Assisted right nephrectomy, as high ureterolith recurrence rates are reported without nephrectomy. Right hand-Assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed and confirmed nephrolithiasis. Since the ureteral stone could not be mobilised, it was left in situ. Post-operative pain management proved a major challenge in this case, and was initially insufficient in spite of a multi-modal approach. Applied pain management techniques as used in human donor nephrectomy require further investigation for potential future use in equine patients. The gelding resumed his activity as a leisure horse six weeks after surgery, but was euthanized three months after surgery due to an unrelated cause. Nephrectomy without ureterolith removal provided a successful solution for this case of severe kidney disease. © 2023 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: Leptospirosis is considered a neglected tropical zoonosis in low-income countries due to surveillance system limitations and non-specificity of symptoms. Humans become infected through direct contact with carrier animals or indirectly through Leptospira-contaminated environments. Conventionally, equines have been considered an uncommon source of leptospirosis, but recent publications in Latin America suggest that their role in the maintenance and dispersion of the bacteria could be more relevant than expected, as horses are susceptible to a wide variety of zoonotic Leptospira spp. from domestic and wild animals with which they share the environment. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted to compile the available information on Leptospira spp. in Ecuador, with a special focus on equine leptospirosis, to better understand the epidemiology of the bacterium and identify possible knowledge gaps. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the published literature was conducted in PubMed, SciELO and Web of Science databases to compile the available information on Leptospira spp. in Ecuador, with a special focus on equine leptospirosis, to better understand the epidemiology of the bacterium. We used a combination of the terms (Leptospira OR Leptospirosis) AND Ecuador, without restrictions on language or publication date. Results: Our literature review reveals that published scientific information is very scarce. Eighteen full-text original scientific articles related to Leptospira or leptospirosis cases in Ecuador were included in the systematic review. Most of the studies reported data obtained from one of the four regions (Coast), and specifically from only one of the 24 Provinces of Ecuador (Manabí), which evidence a large information bias at the geographical level. Furthermore, only the studies focused on humans included clinical signs of leptospirosis and there is only one study that analyzes the presence of Leptospira spp. in water or soil as a risk factor for pathogen transmission. Finally, only one study investigated Leptospira in horses. Conclusion: Since sentinel species can provide useful data on infectious diseases when epidemiologic al information is lacking, and horses could be considered excellent sentinel species to reveal circulating serovars, we propose developing a nationwide surveillance system using horses. This cost-effective epidemiological survey method provides a baseline for implementing specific prevention and control programs in Ecuador and neighboring developing countries.

ABSTRACT: Parascaris spp. infect foals worldwide and foals typically shed eggs in the feces from about three to six months of age, upon which natural immunity is incurred. High levels of anthelmintic resistance of Parascaris spp. are a global concern, and further understanding egg shedding patterns and fecal egg counting (FEC) data variability is of high importance. The aims of this study were to monitor Parascaris spp. egg shedding in untreated foals during 12–23 weeks of age, estimate sources of data variability, and assess precision of two ascarid FEC techniques. Fecal samples were collected weekly from 11 foals born in 2022, from May through November (29 weeks). Six subsamples were extracted from each weekly sample to determine 30 FECs between two techniques: a McMaster technique and an Automated Egg Counting System (AECS). Mixed linear modeling was carried out with age, sex, birth month, seasonality, spring- or summer-born foals, and egg counting technique as explanatory variables. Ascarid FECs were associated with age (p < 0.001), seasonality (p < 0.001), and technique (p < 0.001). The McMaster technique was more precise with a mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 34.57% and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 30.80%− 38.30% compared to the CV for the AECS, which was 42.22% (CI: 37.70%−46.70%). Seasonality accounted for the highest proportion of variance (PV) of all covariates, but differences in PVs for covariates existed between techniques with foal age and subsample contributing more variance to the McMaster, and individual foal and seasonality contributing more to the AECS. Subsamples and replicate counts accounted for less than 1% of the total data variance. The results highlighted substantial differences in PVs between the two techniques at the subsample (AECS: 57.14%; McMaster: 77.51%) and replicate count levels (AECS: 42.86%; McMaster: 22.49%). While differences in precision were observed between the two FEC techniques, they were negligible in the data set, as the overwhelming majority of the data variability in ascarid FECs was attributed to individual foal, seasonality, and foal age. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The benefits of sociality are not equitably shared among members of a social group. The position individuals occupy in social networks is key to maximizing their fitness and contribution to group cohesion, as well as stability in the network structure. Individuals' position in a social network is highly influenced by intra-group competition and affiliation; therefore, it should be assessed by examining various spatial-social variables. In this study, we examined the relationship between proximity, grooming and agonistic networks, controlling for genetic relatedness, and the effects of sociodemographic factors on the strength centrality (SC) of these social networks. We combined drone technology and social network analysis to test several hypotheses on 16 feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) groups during three consecutive breeding seasons. Our results show a clear relationship between spatial and social behaviours, suggesting that proximity and grooming are intimately connected in promoting social bonding, and agonism may be a consequence of close proximity between conspecifics. Sociodemographic factors shaped the three network centralities differently. Females and higher-ranking individuals are more central in spatial networks, whereas younger ones may benefit from higher centrality in affiliative networks. Newly integrated individuals tend to be peripheral on spatial networks and engage more in agonistic behaviours; corroborating that integration into a new group is a costly process for females, ultimately leading to a decreased foaling rate. Individuals in multi-male groups showed higher SC in proximity, but not in agonistic networks, suggesting that a second male may play a role in decreasing overall intra-group competition. Our results provide a step forward in understanding the costs and benefits of network centrality in non-matrilineal societies and mechanisms leading to social cohesion, namely in populations under the constant threat of predation and human pressures. © 2023 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: The objectives of this study were to establish baseline information for seminal traits in Lusitano stallions, to assess the impact of inbreeding, interval between collections and age on semen quality during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and to estimate the corresponding genetic parameters. A total of 2129 ejaculates by 146 Lusitano stallions used for artificial insemination, obtained from four equine reproduction centers distributed throughout Portugal, over a period of 14 years (2008–2021), were included in the study. The seminal traits analyzed, and the corresponding means and standard deviations, were gel-free volume (56.95 ± 28.76 mL), concentration (186.48 ± 104.68 × 106), motility (64.1 ± 16.9%), total number of spermatozoa (TNS) (9.271 ± 4.956 × 109) and total number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate (TNMS) (5.897 ± 3.587 × 109). These results are in the normal range of values described for other breeds. In the stallions analyzed, the mean value for the inbreeding coefficient was 7.93 ± 5.29%, and for age it was 12.70 ± 6.83 years. A significant decline in sperm concentration, motility, TNS, and TNMS was observed as inbreeding increased. The season also influenced sperm concentration, motility, TNS and TNMS, with the highest values observed during the breeding season. When considering the impact of age on Lusitano seminal parameters, results showed a nonlinear relationship, with a positive effect until 18 years of age for volume, motility, TNS and TNMS and a negative effect after this age, with a slow decrease. However, age had a markedly negative effect on sperm concentration. The interval between semen collections only affected (P < 0.05) sperm motility, with a regression coefficient of +1.89 ± 2.17% per additional day. Genetic parameters were estimated with an Animal Model, and the estimated heritability (repeatability) was 0.27 (0.35) for volume, 0.02 (0.38) for sperm concentration, 0.24 (0.44) for motility, 0.29 (0.39) for TNS and 0.41 (0.41) for TNMS. These results suggest that it is possible to improve semen quality by selection and that the properties of semen produced by a stallion tend to remain consistent throughout its lifetime. Furthermore, the impact of inbreeding should be taken into consideration when selecting Lusitano stallions for fertility. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate corneal sensitivity and acute side effects following application of ropivacaine hydrochloride 0.5% and lidocaine hydrochloride 2% on the healthy equine cornea. Animals Studied: Eight healthy adult horses. Procedure: A randomized, masked, crossover study design was utilized. Baseline Semiquantitative Preclinical Ocular Toxicology (SPOT) scores and corneal touch thresholds (CTT) using a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer were recorded and measured, respectively, for eight healthy adult horses before medication application. Commercially available eyewash was used as a negative control. Ropivacaine hydrochloride 0.5% or lidocaine hydrochloride 2% solution was sprayed on a randomly selected eye, and the contralateral eye received eyewash. CTT was measured in both eyes at 1, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 min post-application. Post-application SPOT scores were recorded immediately following the trial. Linear mixed model statistical analyses (mean ± standard error) were performed (p <.05). Results: Mean eyewash CTT (3.41 cm ± 0.464) was significantly different from ropivacaine-treated (1.44 cm ± 0.562) (p =.008) and lidocaine-treated eyes (1.75 cm ± 0.562) (p =.024); CTT was not significantly different between drug groups (p =.88). Time to maximum anesthesia was not significantly different between ropivacaine (13.25 min ± 3.353) and lidocaine (16.25 min ± 3.353) (p =.40). No side effects were appreciated as confirmed by SPOT. Conclusions: Ropivacaine and lidocaine similarly decreased corneal sensitivity when applied topically without clinically evident short-term ocular side effects. Lidocaine may be preferable in clinical settings due to its large, multi-use vials and similar effects to ropivacaine. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: This article describes three cases in which severe foot pathology was managed with surgery and the application of a wooden shoe. Although all three horses would have fulfilled the grounds for humane euthanasia, they were successfully managed and had a favourable outcome. This article supports current farriery concepts and shows how the wooden shoe can effectively redistribute the horse's weight on the solar surface of the foot, alleviate foot pain, enhance foot biomechanics and serve as a valuable tool for veterinarians and farriers in post-surgical management of laminitis and other foot-related injuries. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The influence of the increase in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the period 2016–2021 on the reproductive system of warm-water fishes: Blunt-snouted mullet and Mediterranean horse mackerel are considered. It is shown that in the period from 2016 to 2021 in the Mediterranean basin in the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, the tendency to increase the annual average temperature is higher than in the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It was found that in the North-Western part of the Black Sea, the temperature increase for a year and for five years is the highest compared to other considered areas of the Mediterranean basin. The analysis showed an influence of the trend of increasing the water temperature of the seas of the Mediterranean basin on the reproductive system of warm-water fish species. Thus, in the Aegean Sea and Mediterranean Sea, during the study period, there was a shift in the timing of spawning from the summer months to the spring months, with the highest GSI value in April-May. In the Marmara Sea and Black Sea, spawning period remains the same from April to September, but the highest GSI values have shifted from July-August to June. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE The objectives of this study were to quantify lymphocytes and eosinophils in the mucosa of the duodenum and rectum in asthmatic horses. ANIMALS 8 healthy and 10 asthmatic horses. PROCEDURES Asthmatic horses were evaluated in a symptomatic (after 6 weeks of exposure to moldy hay) and asymptomatic status (3 and 7 months after being fed alfalfa pellets [n = 4] or treated with inhaled fluticasone [6]). Duodenal and rectal biopsies were endoscopically (n = 4 to 6) taken in each horse. Eosinophils were counted on slides stained with hematoxylin, eosin, phloxine, and saffron, and immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate T and B lymphocytes using CD3 and CD20, respectively. RESULTS The duodenal and rectal epithelium of asthmatic and control horses contained exclusively T lymphocytes (CD3). Symptomatic asthmatic horses, compared to controls, had a significantly higher number of T lymphocytes (CD3) in the duodenal epithelium (P = .016) and the adjacent lamina propria of the villi (P = .04). Compared to symptomatic asthmatic horses, the fluticasone-treated group had significantly fewer T lymphocytes in the total lamina propria of the rectal mucosa (P < .01). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Taken together, these results suggest that asthmatic horses have greater infiltration of T lymphocytes in the duodenal and rectal mucosa, indicating a certain degree of inflammation, which could be due to a systemic inflammatory effect and/or a local effect of ingested hay allergens in asthmatic horses. Systemic markers of inflammation have not been investigated to better qualify if the infiltration noted is due to a local and/or systemic effect. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ABSTRACT: This study examines the effect of a corporate citizenship-oriented high-performance work system (CC-oriented HPWS) and the interactive influence of CC-oriented HPWS and person-organization fit (PO fit) on creativity at the individual level. Our analysis of field data collected from 303 employees in two branch companies with a two-phase collection method provides empirical support for our theoretical model. The results indicate that HPWS reflecting corporate citizenship (CC) correlates positively with individual creativity. In addition, the moderating effect of PO fit is significant in the relationship between CC-oriented HPWS and creativity at the individual level. On this basis, this paper discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for future research. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses are traditionally used in Kazakhstan as a source of food and as working and saddle animals as well. Here, for the first time, microarray-based medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of six traditionally defined types and breeds of indigenous Kazakh horses was conducted to reveal their genetic structure and find markers associated with animal size and weight. The results showed that the predefined separation between breeds and sampled populations was not supported by the molecular data. The lack of genetic variation between breeds and populations was revealed by the principal component analysis, ADMIXTURE, and distance-based analyses, as well as the general population parameters expected and observed heterozygosity (He and Ho) and between-group fixation index (Fst). The analysis revealed that the studied types and breeds should be considered as a single breed, namely the ‘Kazakh horse’. The comparison with previously published data on global horse breed diversity revealed the relatively high level of individual diversity of Kazakh horses in comparison with the well-known foreign breeds. The Mongolian and Tuva breeds were identified as the closest horse landraces, demonstrating similar patterns of internal variability. The genome-wide association analysis was performed for animal size and weight as the traits directly related with the meat productivity of horses. The analysis identified a set of 60 SNPs linked with horse genes involved in the regulation of processes of development of connective tissues and the bone system, neural system, immune system regulation, and other processes. The present study is novel and introduces Kazakh horses as a promising genetic source for horse breeding and selection both on the domestic and international levels. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Oocyte in vitro maturation is necessary for the study and application of animal-assisted reproduction technology in animal reproduction and breeding. The comprehensive transcriptional profile of equine oocyte maturated in vitro has not been fully mined yet, which makes many key transcriptional events still unidentified. Here, Smart-seq2 was performed to analyse the gene expression pattern and the underlying regulatory mechanism of horse germinal vesicle (GV) and in vitro metaphase II (MII) oocytes. The results showed that 6402 genes (2640 up-regulated and 3762 down-regulated in MII samples compared to GV) and 4021 lncRNA transcripts (1210 up-regulated and 2811 down-regulated in MII samples compared to GV) were differentially expressed in GV and MII oocytes. Further, GO and KEGG analysis found that differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs were mainly enriched in the pathways related to energy and lipid metabolism. In addition, LGALS3 was found a key gene in mediating the regulation of oocyte meiosis recovery and fertilization ability. This study provides novel knowledge about gene expression and energy metabolism during equine oocyte maturation and a reference for the further study and application of assisted reproductive technology in horse reproduction and breeding. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: African horse sickness is an equine orbivirus transmitted by Culicoides Latreille biting midges. In the last 80 years, it has caused several devastating outbreaks in the equine population in Europe, the Far and Middle East, North Africa, South-East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is endemic in South Africa; however, a unique control area has been set up in the Western Cape where increased surveillance and control measures have been put in place. A deterministic metapopulation model was developed to explore if an outbreak might occur, and how it might develop, if a latently infected horse was to be imported into the control area, by varying the geographical location and months of import. To do this, a previously published ordinary differential equation model was developed with a metapopulation approach and included a vaccinated horse population. Outbreak length, time to peak infection, number of infected horses at the peak, number of horses overall affected (recovered or dead), re-emergence, and Rv (the basic reproduction number in the presence of vaccination) were recorded and displayed using GIS mapping. The model predictions were compared to previous outbreak data to ensure validity. The warmer months (November to March) had longer outbreaks than the colder months (May to September), took more time to reach the peak, and had a greater total outbreak size with more horses infected at the peak. Rv appeared to be a poor predictor of outbreak dynamics for this simulation. A sensitivity analysis indicated that control measures such as vaccination and vector control are potentially effective to manage the spread of an outbreak, and shortening the vaccination window to July to September may reduce the risk of vaccine-associated outbreaks.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the genetic variations of the horse (Equus caballus) genome will improve breeding conservation and welfare. However, genetic variations in long segments, such as structural variants (SVs), remain understudied. We de novo assembled 10 chromosome-level three-dimensional horse genomes, each representing a distinct breed, and analysed horse SVs using a multi-assembly approach. Our findings suggest that SVs with the accumulation of mammalian-wide interspersed repeats related to long interspersed nuclear elements might be a horse-specific mechanism to modulate genome-wide gene regulatory networks. We found that olfactory receptors were commonly loss and accumulated deleterious mutations, but no purge of deleterious mutations occurred during horse domestication. We examined the potential effects of SVs on the spatial structure of chromatin via topologically associating domains (TADs). Breed-specific TADs were significantly enriched by breed-specific SVs. We identified 4199 unique breakpoint-resolved novel insertions across all chromosomes that account for 2.84 Mb sequences missing from the reference genome. Several novel insertions might have potential functional consequences, as 519 appeared to reside within 449 gene bodies. These genes are primarily involved in pathogen recognition, innate immune responses and drug metabolism. Moreover, 37 diverse horses were resequenced. Combining this with public data, we analysed 97 horses through a comparative population genomics approach to identify the genetic basis underlying breed characteristics using Thoroughbreds as a case study. We provide new scientific evidence for horse domestication, an understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying the phenotypic evolution of horses, and a comprehensive genetic variation resource for further genetic studies of horses. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Thermography is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging technique that detects regions of the body surface with increased (or decreased) temperature by measuring infrared radiation. It reveals physiological and pathophysiological changes primarily related to blood flow and metabolic rate in the examined body regions, as well as altered heat production. These include physical stress, various physical injuries, medical conditions, and environmental factors. In equine medicine, thermography can be used for early detection of tissue temperature changes, allowing intervention at an early stage of a medical deterioration. Thermographic examination can be used to detect tissue abnormalities in all regions of the body. It is particularly useful for the detection of musculoskeletal disorders. Inflammatory processes are present in many diseases and injuries, which can be successfully detected with thermography. Thermography makes it possible to monitor the success of treatment. Often, thermographically visible disease changes are detected before clinical signs or other imaging techniques become visible in the animal. In physical therapy, it helps locate regions of the body in need of treatment and plays an important role in detecting illegal procedures (such as local analgesics) to improve competitive performance in horses. Thermography serves as a complementary diagnostic tool. However, in practice, it has some limitations. The method is not specific and cannot determine the etiology of pathological changes. Therefore, it is usually used together with other diagnostic methods (such as X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and can not replace them.  © 2023 Peter Kruljc, published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: With an increasing number of systems for quantifying lameness-related movement asymmetry, between-system comparisons under non-laboratory conditions are important for multi-centre or referral-level studies. This study compares an artificial intelligence video app to a validated inertial measurement unit (IMU) gait analysis system in a specific group of horses. METHODS: Twenty-two reining Quarter horses were equipped with nine body-mounted IMUs while being videoed with a smartphone app. Both systems quantified head and pelvic movement symmetry during in-hand trot (hard/soft ground) and on the lunge (left/right rein, soft ground). Proportional limits of agreement (pLoA) were established. RESULTS: Widths of pLoA were larger for head movement (29% to 50% in-hand; 22% to 38% on lunge) than for pelvic movement (13% to 24% in-hand; 14% to 24% on lunge). CONCLUSION: The between-system pLoAs exceed current "lameness thresholds" aimed at identifying the affected limb(s) in lame horses. They also exceed published limits of agreement for stride-matched data but are similar to repeatability values and "lameness thresholds" from "non-lame" horses. This is encouraging for multi-centre studies and referral-level veterinary practice. The narrower pLoA values for pelvic movement asymmetry are particularly encouraging, given the difficulty of grading hind limb lameness "by eye".

ABSTRACT: The aim of the research was to assess how age, sex, sire, country of foaling, country of training and race distance influenced the international racing and performance of Thoroughbreds. The research was based on performance ratings of 6216 horses assigned by the International Federation of Racing Authorities between 2004 and 2022. The most common sex was stallion (58.54 %) and more than half of the population consisted of 3- and 4-year-old horses (54.68 %). The majority of the horses had the USA as their country of foaling (25.92 %) and also as their country of training (24.87 %). The sire with the largest number of offspring in the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) databases was Galileo (IRE) (193 horses). Four of the 10 most frequently represented sires belonged to the Sadler's Wells (USA) paternal line. The analysis of the statistics in the database as a whole established a significant (p<0.001) influence of all observed factors. Stallions achieved a significantly higher rating (117.85) compared to geldings (117.17) and mares (117.13). The horses originating in Ireland achieved a statistically higher rating (117.99) than horses from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, a group of other countries designated "Others"and South Africa. Statistically conclusive differences were found between horses trained in Ireland (118.80) and all other countries except Great Britain and France. Five of the 10 sires with the best offspring rating belong to the Mr. Prospector (USA) paternal line. © 2023 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Riding schools play an essential role in the equestrian industry and in education. These establishments are reliant on horses to work for numerous hours, often with riders of different abilities. However, little is known about the impact workload has on the well-being of these horses and effective monitoring of welfare is required for animal-based industries to maintain their Social Licence to Operate. The aim of the current study was to investigate how the quantity of work carried out by riding school horses affects their behaviour and physiology, providing evidence as a starting point to identify suitable levels of work that riding school horses can be used for before their welfare is compromised. Horses (n = 30) were observed 1–2 h after completing their workload on a day of Rest, Moderate (1–2 h) and Hard work (3–4 h). Infrared thermography of eye temperature (IRT) and heart rate variability (RMSSD) were measured as indicators of arousal. The Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) was scored treatment-blind to measure discomfort and pain. No significant difference was found between RMSSD or eye temperature depending on the level of workload, indicating subjects were able to cope with increasing demands. However, there was a significant difference in the HGS score between Rest, Moderate and Hard work (p < 0.001). This indicates a greater degree of discomfort following an increase in hours of work. Another possible explanation for the increase of the HGS score is that tiredness can influence the presence of some of the FAUs (e.g., backward ears and orbital tightening) making it more difficult to discriminate between whether a horse was in pain or the increased score is a consequence of being physically tired after the work. Findings indicate that 1–2 days of working 3–4 h can be appropriate in horses conditioned to the work in well managed riding facilities, however further research is needed to determine how long increased HGS lasts to determine how often days of hard work may occur without impacting welfare. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Horses constantly face several challenges inherent to the domestic environment, and it is common for the expression of their natural behavior to be drastically limited. Environmental enrichment has been suggested as an alternative to improve the captive situation of domestic horses. Among the recently proposed enrichment strategies, olfactory stimulation has emerged as a method for improving several aspects related to animal behavior. Olfaction is a sensory modality that plays a significant role in the expression of equine behavior, and in recent years, studies have shown that olfactory stimulation can influence the physiological and behavioral parameters of horses. This review provides current information on the anatomical particularities of the equine olfactory system, presents the physiological mechanisms involved in the odor detection process, and demonstrates how stress can interfere with this process. Finally, the use of olfactory stimulation as an environmental enrichment for domestic horses (Equus ferus caballus) is explored. The need for new studies that answer pertinent questions related to this topic is discussed throughout the manuscript. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess oral buccal microcirculation by hand-held videomicroscopy in horses during colic surgery, comparing microcirculation values with macrocirculatory parameters and with those of healthy elective surgical horses. Study design: Clinical prospective study. Animals: Client-owned horses (nine in the colic group; 11 in the elective group). Methods: In the colic group, buccal mucosal side stream dark-field microscopy (DFM) videos, cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and lactate were obtained at three timepoints under general anesthesia (30, 90, and 150 min after induction). Video analysis was used to determine total vessel density, proportion of perfused vessels, perfused vessel density, and heterogeneity index. Dark-field microscopy videos, MAP, and lactate were obtained at a single timepoint under general anesthesia (45 min after induction) in the elective group. Results: There were no differences in microcirculatory parameters between colic and elective horses, nor was there a difference across timepoints in the colic group. There was a weak negative correlation between microvascular parameters and CO (rho = −0.23). Conclusion: The colic group did not have decreased microcirculation in comparison with the healthy elective group. Dark-field microscopy did not correlate well with macrocirculatory parameters in the colic group. Impact: Dark-field microscopy may not be a sensitive enough indicator to detect differences in microcirculation between colic and elective groups. The lack of difference in microcirculation may be due to sample size, probe location, or variation in disease severity. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are stable in bodily fluids and are potential biomarkers of various diseases and physiological states. Although several studies have been conducted on humans to detect drug doping by miRNAs, research on drugs and miRNAs in horses is limited. In this study, circulating miRNAs in horses after hydrocortisone administration were profiled and variations in miRNAs affected by hydrocortisone administration during endogenous hydrocortisone elevation were examined. The miRNAs were extracted from thoroughbred horse plasma before and after hydrocortisone administration and subjected to small RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR validation was performed for the 20 miRNAs that were most affected by hydrocortisone administration. The effects of elevated endogenous hydrocortisone levels due to exercise and adrenocorticotropic hormone administration were also confirmed. The validation results showed that approximately half of the miRNAs showed the same significant differences as those obtained using small RNA sequencing. Among the twenty miRNAs, two novel miRNAs and miR-133a were found to vary differently between exogenous hydrocortisone administration and endogenous hydrocortisone elevation. This study provides basic knowledge regarding the circulating miRNA profile of horses after hydrocortisone administration and identifies three miRNAs that could potentially be used as biomarkers to detect hydrocortisone administration. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Thirty controls (C) and 30 IBH-affected (T) Lusitano horses were evaluated. T horses were included based on anamnesis and physical examination, supported by questionnaires. All horses were submitted to skin tests, Intrademal (IDT) and Skin Prick Tests (SPT), on the neck with 14 specific allergens, 13 recombinant proteins (r-proteins) from Culicoides nubeculosus (Cul n) and Culicoides obsoletus (Cul o) salivary glands and Culicoides nubeculosus Whole Body Extract (Cul n WBE). Addicionally, a cluster of six T and six C horses were also tested with Cul n 3 and Cul n 4 produced in insect cells and barley, as well as E. coli produced Cul o 3 and Cul o WBE. Allergen concentrations were 10 µg/mL for IDT and 100 µg/mL for SPT, and wheal diameters assessed at 20 min, 6 and 48 h. IDTs were considered positive when wheal diameter was ≥50% of the histamine wheal and SPT’s ≥ 0.9 cm. In vitro tests, allergen-specific serum IgE and sulfidoleukotriene (sLT) release assay were also carried out. Results showed that Cul n WBE, Cul n 7, 8, 9, Cul o1P and Cul o 2P were the best performing allergens for SPTs (p ≤ 0.0001) for the 1st allergen panel and Cul o WBE, Cul n 3 Bar and Cul n 4 Bac (p ≤ 0.05) for the 2nd, presenting a higher discriminatory diagnostic potential than IDTs, at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, with readings assessed at 20 min. Regarding in vitro tests overall, the sLT release assay performed best. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Communication of emotions plays a key role in intraspecific social interactions and likely in interspecific interactions. Several studies have shown that animals perceive human joy and anger, but few studies have examined other human emotions, such as sadness. In this study, we conducted a cross-modal experiment, in which we showed 28 horses two soundless videos simultaneously, one showing a sad, and one a joyful human face. These were accompanied by either a sad or joyful voice. The number of horses whose first look to the video that was incongruent with the voice was longer than their first look to the congruent video was higher than chance, suggesting that horses could form cross-modal representations of human joy and sadness. Moreover, horses were more attentive to the videos of joy and looked at them for longer, more frequently, and more rapidly than the videos of sadness. Their heart rates tended to increase when they heard joy and to decrease when they heard sadness. These results show that horses are able to discriminate facial and vocal expressions of joy and sadness and may form cross-modal representations of these emotions; they also are more attracted to joyful faces than to sad faces and seem to be more aroused by a joyful voice than a sad voice. Further studies are needed to better understand how horses perceive the range of human emotions, and we propose that future experiments include neutral stimuli as well as emotions with different arousal levels but a same valence. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: The heart conduction system is responsible for the occurrence of various types of cardiac arrhythmia. This study aimed to histologically and morphometrically describe damaged cardiac nodes during acute myocardial infarction and to compare them with normal tissues in dogs and horses. Materials and Methods: This study describes the morphometry of cardiac nodes in five dogs and five elderly horses that succumbed to sudden cardiac death (SCD). A computerized morphometric study was conducted to determine the number of cells composing the nodes, different shape and size parameters of nodes, and their relationship with degenerative changes due to cardiac conditions. Results: In both species, the sinoatrial node (SAN) was ovoid in shape whereas the atrioventricular node (AVN) was pyramidal in shape. The percentage of collagen fibers inside the SAN of dogs (47%) and horses (50%) was found to be higher than that of cells. In contrast, the percentage of cells in the AVN of dogs (24%) and horses (16%) was higher than that of connective tissues. In the SAN, the area (p = 0.09), maximum diameter (<0.001), and mean diameter (0.003) of P cells were larger in dogs than in horses. Conclusion: Overall, the SAN cells and surrounding cardiomyocytes in dogs and horses as well as the AVN cells in dogs that succumbed to SCD decreased in size compared with those in normal hearts.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To describe the technique, postoperative complications, and outcome after autologous fascia lata grafting with conjunctival flap overlay in horses with ulcerative keratitis and keratomalacia. Study design: Retrospective case series. Animals: Eleven horses with ulcerative keratitis and keratomalacia. Methods: Horses included had undergone fascia lata grafting with conjunctival flap overlay due to impending or recent corneal perforation. Preceding therapy, lesion characteristics, postoperative complications, and short- and long-term outcomes were recorded. Results: Postoperative complications included complete (1/11) or partial (2/11) dehiscence of the conjunctival flap and fascia lata graft, postoperative pneumonia (1/11), intermittent hypercreatinemia (2/11) and mild uveitis after trimming of the conjunctival flap (9/10). The donor sites healed without complications (11/11). A satisfactory short-term outcome (at cessation of medical therapy) was achieved in all horses (11/11). Long-term follow-up (median 29 months, range 7–127 months) was available for 10/11 horses. A comfortable eye with functional vision was achieved in 9/10 horses with long-term follow-up, including 3/4 horses with prior corneal perforation and 1/11 horses in which the fascia lata graft completely dehisced 15 days after surgery. Enucleation was required in a single horse (1/10) after phthisis bulbi developed 7 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Fascia lata grafting with conjunctival flap overlay appears to be a viable solution for globe preservation in horses with ulcerative keratitis and keratomalacia. Long-term ocular comfort with functional visual outcomes can be achieved in most cases with limited concerns for donor site morbidity while bypassing acquisition, storage or lesion-size limitations related to other biomaterials. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the radiographic prevalence of periarticular osteophytes of the distal tarsus in nonlame yearling Standardbred horses, and to evaluate its potential impact on race performance. Study design: Cross-sectional cohort study. Animals: Client-owned yearling Standardbred horses (n = 416). Methods: Bilateral tarsal radiographs were available from all horses for review. Osteophytes were measured on radiographs using clinical visualization software and categorized by size. Racing records were obtained from the United States Trotting Association. Regression analysis was used to determine associations between presence or size of periarticular osteophytes and performance parameters with sex and gait covariates. Results: Of 416 Standardbred yearlings without clinical lameness, 113 (27.1%) had distal tarsal periarticular osteophytes. Regression analyses revealed few associations between the presence of periarticular osteophytes and performance parameters. Affected horses had fewer starts at 4 years of age (incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.92, p =.01) and fewer lifetime starts (IRR 0.95, p =.003), but the effect size was small. Within the affected group, osteophyte size was only associated with number of starts at 3 (IRR 0.67, p <.0001). Sex and gait affected many performance parameters. Conclusion: The prevalence of distal tarsal periarticular osteophytes was similar to that in other breeds. Periarticular osteophytes of the distal tarsus appeared to be a largely incidental finding in nonlame yearling Standardbreds intended for harness racing. Clinical significance: Distal tarsal periarticular osteophytes in young, nonlame Standardbred horses should affect racing potential only minimally. This is in contrast to reports from other disciplines. © 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Surgery published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Differentiating immune-mediated causes from other causes of anemia and thrombocytopenia can be challenging. Flow cytometry can detect surface-associated immunoglobulin (sIg) on red blood cells (RBC) and platelets (PLT) in dogs and horses. Sample storage parameters for ideal assay performance has not been evaluated in horses. The study objective is to identify optimal storage time and temperature of equine whole blood for the detection of RBC-sIg and PLT-sIg via flow cytometry. Both assays were performed on samples at time 0, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h post collection. RBC-sIg samples were stored at 4 °C and PLT-sIg samples were stored at 4 °C and room temperature. RBC-sIg percentages were stable up to 72 h storage. Platelet surface-associated IgG percent positive platelets increased above baseline at all timepoints and percent positive platelets were inconsistent across timepoints for IgM and IgA. PLT-sIg testing should ideally be performed within 4 h of collection. In instances where this is not feasible, samples should be stored at 4 °C and analyzed no later than 24 h after collection. Whereas cutoff values for RBC-sIg remained similar across timepoints, results for PLT-sIg should be compared to time-specific cutoff or reference intervals established by the laboratory running the test. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Barrel racing involves sprinting through a cloverleaf pattern in under 20 s. The prevalence of upper airway obstructions (UAO) in barrel racers is unknown, thus a retrospective analysis of 164 client-owned horses referred for overground endoscopy (OGE) between 2014 and 2022 was performed. Referring complaints included respiratory noise, cough, epistaxis, behaviour (owner reported stress/anxiety, refusal to enter arena, excessive head shaking), and/or poor performance. Horses performed a standardized exercise test with low and high-speed components. Videoendoscopic recordings were systematically scored by one experienced clinician. Exercising abnormalities included palatal instability (PI), intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate (iDDSP), nasopharyngeal collapse (NPC), recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN), ventro-medial luxation of the apex of the corniculate process of the arytenoid (VLAC), medial deviation of the aryepiglottic fold (MDAF), vocal fold collapse (VFC), and cricotracheal ligament collapse. Associations between co-existing UAOs, age and sex were examined (McNemar's test; logistic regression; P < 0.05). During exercise, 24/164 (15%) horses had no UAO. In the remaining 140 horses, 56% had two or more. NPC was observed in 68/140 (49%), PI in 59/140 (42%), iDDSP in 55/140 (39%), VFC in 38/140 (27%), RLN in 27/140 (19%), VLAC in 14/140 (10%), MDAF in 8/140 (6%) and cricotracheal ligament collapse in 8/140 (6%). Nasopharyngeal collapse and RLN were primarily Grade 3 and Grade B, respectively. Associations exist between several co-existing UAOs, but not age or sex. Abnormalities were more frequent at low-speed (55%) than high-speed (22%), highlighting the importance of OGEs at different exercise intensities. Multiple UAOs appear common in barrel racers with clinical presentations. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to examine the race-, horse- and jockey-level risk factors for race day fatality in New Zealand Thoroughbred jumps racing using retrospective race day data from the 2011/12 to 2021/22 seasons (n = 8,970 starts). There were 51 race day fatalities resulting in an incidence rate of 5.7 per 1,000 starts (95% C.I. 4.3–7.5). The majority of fatalities were the result of fractures (44/51, 4.9 per 1,000 starts, 95% C.I. 3.7–6.6). Steeplechase and hurdle races had the same incidence of fatal fractures of 4.9 per 1,000 starts (95% C.I. 3.7–6.6, P >.05). Most (70.5%) of the fatal fractures were due to a horse falling during the race. In steeplechase races, horses running in races over 4,201 m were 5.0 times (95% C.I. 1.2–33.0) more likely to sustain a fatal fracture than horses in racing over shorter distances. In hurdle races, horses racing during spring were 2.2 times (95% C.I. 1.0–4.8) more likely to sustain a fatal fracture compared to winter. Due to the low number of suspected cardiac failures and fatal soft tissue injuries, risk factors for these fatalities could not be identified. These data provide a baseline to enable evidence-based regulatory changes and prospectively monitor the effectiveness of changes made. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: An 18-year-old Freiberger gelding was presented with a history of intermittent left hindlimb lameness after an acute onset 2 weeks prior to referral. The lameness had not responded to anti-inflammatory therapy prescribed by the referring veterinarian. Physical, orthopaedic and neurological examinations revealed signs compatible with ipsilateral femoral nerve dysfunction. Transrectal sonographic examination showed a marked increase in the diameter of the left femoral nerve. The results of electromyography of the left hind quadriceps muscle were compatible with denervation attributable to neuropathy. Evaluation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis consisting of medium-sized lymphocytes, 5%–10% of which were positive for CD3 and CD79a. Neoplasia was suspected and steroid therapy was started. However, exacerbation of the clinical signs occurred and the horse was euthanised. Histopathological evaluation showed neurolymphomatosis of the left femoral nerve as the cause of the lameness. Infiltration of tumour cells was also seen to a lesser extent in the right femoral nerve, spinal cord, various parts of the cardiovascular system, renal capsules, an abdominal lymph node and the subcutis of the left stifle and upper lip. Histochemical evaluation revealed 60%–70% of the neoplastic lymphocytes were positive for CD20 and CD79a and up to 40% were positive for CD3. This report describes the uniqueness of a femoral mononeuropathy as the main clinical finding of B-cell neurolymphomatosis and multicentric lymphoma. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) is an increasingly diagnosed degenerative dental disease in aged horses. The primary aim of this retrospective study was to determine the prevalence of EOTRH in horses admitted to the Equine Hospital, University of Zurich, for dental procedures from 2004 to 2017. A secondary goal was to measure and compare interincisal angles on two-dimensional radiographs of horses with EOTRH to determine whether the interincisal angle is associated with age and severity of the disease. Radiographs were assessed for the presence of lysis and/or hypercementosis, and the number and position of the teeth affected were determined. Each tooth was also evaluated using the modified classification system introduced by Rehrl et al. (2018), in which stage 0 indicates no radiographic abnormalities and stage 3 denotes severe abnormalities. The overall stage was defined by the tooth with the most severe lesions. The interincisal angle was determined in horses that had suitable radiographs. The medical records of 838 horses admitted for dental procedures were evaluated, and 85 (10,1%) had clinical evidence of EOTRH. The mean interincisal angle was 136,06 ° in horses with mild to moderate EOTRH and 135,10 ° (SD = 11,90 °) in severely affected patients. In conclusion, the angle measurements on lateral radiographs were highly reproducible. However, the interincisal angle was not associated with age or the severity of EOTRH. The interincisal angle and the disease pattern were not correlated. © 2023, Gesellschaft Schweizer Tierarztinnen und Tierarzte. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Hair whorls are a hereditary feature in horses that may be associated with temperament and coat color. Hair whorls are described as changes in the hair pattern and may take various forms, such as circular and linear whorls. We first carried out a frequency analysis of hair whorls (circular and linear). Next, a Generalized Non-Linear Model was computed to assess the significance of some potential influencing factors, and a genetic parameter estimation was performed. ENDOG software v4.8 was used to estimate the inbreeding coefficient of all the animals analyzed. It was more common to find horses with circular hair whorls than with linear whorls. The heritability ranges obtained were, in general, medium-high for both circular whorls (0.20 to 0.90) and linear whorls (0.44 to 0.84). High positive correlations were found on the between left and right positions, indicating a tendency to symmetry in certain locations. The laterality of hair whorls was also evidenced, with the biggest concentration on the left-hand side, particularly in gray horses, showing circular whorls below the central line of eyes, which has been associated in a previous paper with a calmer and more docile temperament. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Centromeres play a key role in the maintenance of genome stability to prevent carcinogenesis and diseases. They are specialized chromosome loci essential to ensure faithful transmission of genomic information across cell generations by mediating the interaction with spindle microtubules. Nonetheless, while fulfilling these essential roles, their distinct repetitive composition and susceptibility to mechanical stresses during cell division render them susceptible to breakage events. In this review, we delve into the present understanding of the underlying causes of centromere fragility, from the mechanisms governing its DNA replication and repair, to the pathways acting to counteract potential challenges. We propose that the centromere represents a “Trojan horse” exerting vital functions that, at the same time, potentially threatens whole genome stability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Semen Aesculi, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has a long history of use for treating chest and abdominal pain with distension. In addition, the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) is another species of Aesculus in Europe and has notable clinical significance in alleviating chronic venous insufficiency, hemorrhoids, and postoperative edema. Thus, highlighting the comparative study of Semen Aesculi and horse chestnut may broaden clinical applications. Objectives: To conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis on the chemical profiling of these two varieties and determine whether they have equivalent clinical efficacy by integrating plant metabolomics and multivariate statistical methods. Methods: Initially, a comprehensive characterisation was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) platform, and in total 44 active ingredients were identified. Then, untargeted metabolomics combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied for the discrimination of a German species and three official Chinese species. Next, 24 marker compounds responsible for the discrimination of different species were screened out and used to predict the species of unknown samples by genetic algorithm-optimised support vector machine (GA-SVM) with a high prediction accuracy. Finally, a heatmap visualisation was employed for clarifying the distribution of the identified active ingredients. Results: The three species of Chinese Semen Aesculi showed distinct separation from each other, while European horse chestnut and Aesculus chinensis Bunge were similar in chemical composition. Conclusions: This work provided experimental evidence for further expanding the clinical application of Chinese Semen Aesculi and promoted the species identification and quality control of Semen Aesculi. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Hippophagy is a practice that is far from being consensual, even among meat eaters. Horse meat consumption remains limited or is even strongly declining in some countries such as France. However, the nutritional, organoleptic and environmental benefits of this meat invite us to consider horse meat products as a valuable alternative source of protein. This research therefore aims to identify and characterize different profiles of consumers and non-consumers of horse meat in terms of personal values, attitudes, motivations and behaviors. Based on data from a quantitative survey among 482 French meat consumers, we distinguish 4 categories of individuals: “Enthusiast”, “Distant”, “Aversive” and “Potential”. While “Distant” and “Aversive” show a low level of acceptability towards horse meat, “Enthusiast” and “Potential” reveal characteristics that are favorable to horse meat consumption. Targeted strategies to support the horse meat market are proposed and discussed in light of these results that also provide insight into the future for meat in general. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Background: Leaky gut syndrome (LGS) is an idiopathic disorder characterised by alterations in intestinal permeability and low-grade systemic inflammation. Factors contributing to development of LGS are not well-understood but physiological stressors such as exercise and transport may play a role which may be of pathophysiological relevance in horses. Objectives: To characterise the combined effect of transport stress and exercise on gastrointestinal permeability, and to determine whether these effects are associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers in plasma. Study design: Controlled, randomised and cross-over study. Methods: Horses (n = 8 per group) were given a gastrointestinal permeability tracer (iohexol; 5.6% solution; 1 ml/kg bwt) via nasogastric entubation prior to being assigned to a stressed (EX; 1 h of trailer transport immediately followed by 30 min moderate intensity exercise; n = 4) or sedentary control (CON; n = 4) group. Plasma samples were obtained prior to iohexol administration (P1), after transport (P2), at exercise cessation (P3), and at 1 (P4), 2 (P5), 4 (P6) and 8 (P7) hours after cessation of exercise and were analysed for iohexol, inflammatory biomarkers (SAA, LPS, IFABP and LBP) and tight junction proteins (zonulin). Faecal samples were collected at times corresponding to before and after stress from both groups and analysed for zonulin. Data were analysed using a 2-way RM ANOVA. Results: In EX horses, a significant increase in iohexol was observed at P2 (1.5 ± 0.24 μg/ml; p = 0.03), P3 (2.1 ± 0.29 μg/ml; p < 0.001), P4 (2.1 ± 0.17 μg/ml; p < 0.001) compared with P1 (0.7 ± 0.21 μg/ml); iohexol was significantly higher in EX than CON horses at P3 (p < 0.001), P4 (p < 0.001) and P5 (p = 0.003). LPS and SAA were significantly higher in EX than CON at P4 (p < 0.001) and P6 (p = 0.04), respectively. Main limitations: Data from our small sample size may not be generalisable to the larger equine population. Conclusions: Combined transport and exercise increases gastrointestinal permeability and systemic SAA and LPS. The model described herein may be useful in further studies on the role of alterations in gastrointestinal permeability in equine disease. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Fungi are ubiquitous in the environment and part of the commensal microflora on the conjunctiva of equine eyes. North Queensland, being tropical, presents an ideal environment for fungi growth. When the cornea is injured, fungi can invade the corneal stroma, resulting in keratomycosis. The objectives of this study were to determine the fungal species specific to the eyes of horses in the Townsville region; to investigate the potential risk factors associated with the presence of fungi; and to test their susceptibility to antifungals to create an empirical guide for treatment. The eyes of forty ophthalmologically normal horses from James Cook University were sampled throughout the summer months of December 2017, January 2018, and January and February 2020. Cultured fungi were identified morphologically, and their identity confirmed by comparing partial 18sRNA DNA sequences with the NCBI nucleotide database. Minimum inhibitory concentration testing of common antifungal medications was performed. Sixty-one out of eighty conjunctival samples grew fungi, and 21 different fungi genera were isolated. The most common genera were Aspergillus (18%, 26/141), Curvularia (14%,20/141), Rhodotorula (12%,17/141) and Penicillium (12%,17/141). No significant association was found between age or environmental factors and fungal culture status. Most fungi were highly susceptible to voriconazole and ketoconazole but resistant to fluconazole and amphotericin B. This adds to the body of evidence on which species of fungi are present as normal ocular microflora of horses living in tropical regions of Australia, and an avenue for treating them. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: Pregnancy affects maternal hemodynamics. The changes in autonomic nervous system activity for hemodynamics adaptation in pregnant horses are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to examine the effect of pregnancy on electrocardiographic, vasovagal tonus index, and echocardiographic variables in horses. Materials and Methods: A total of 23 Thai native crossbred mares without any cardiac abnormalities were included in this study. The animals were assigned into two groups, a non-pregnant mare group (n =12) and a pregnant mare group (n = 11). Electrocardiogram recordings (paper speed = 25 mm/s and calibration = 10 mm/mV) were performed to obtain six limb leads (leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF). The vasovagal tonus index (VVTI) was calculated to assess variability in heart rate over short periods using just 20 consecutive beats. Cardiac structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography. Results: Heart rate, P wave duration, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and T wave duration were significantly different between non-pregnant and pregnant horses (p < 0.05). Pregnant horses had significantly lower VVTI than non-pregnant (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in cardiac structures including % interventricular septum (IVS), % left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW), IVS in diastole, left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole, LVPW thickness at end-diastole, IVS in systole, left ventricular internal diameter at end-systole, LVPW thickness at end-systole, and left atrium/aortic roots ratio between the two groups. However, the pregnant horses had a significantly higher cardiac output and % ejection fraction than non-pregnant horses (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study provided the first evidence that hemodynamic adaptations during pregnancy modified cardiac conduction, vasovagal tonus index, and echocardiographic variables in horses.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microsatellite (Ms) variation in Jeju and American horses and their phylogenetic relationship, and to establish a lineage-based breeding plan for domestic American miniature horse (AMH) and Quarter horse (QH) in Korea. A total of 83 horse samples (27 AMHs, 32 QHs, and 24 Jeju horses [JHs]) were genotyped with 17 Ms markers. The observed number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 (HTG7) to 12 (ASB17), with an average value of 7.71, 7.41, and 6.11 in AMH, QH, and JH, respectively. Of the 17 Ms markers, HTG4, HTG6, HTG7, HMS1 markers had relatively low PIC values (<0.6) in AMH and HMS1 in QH, and ASB2, HMS7, HTG4, ASB23, HMS1, HTG10 in JH. An average level of genetic variation was as follows: AMH, HE= 0.7300 and HO= 0.7317; QH, HE= 0.7505 and HO= 0.7011; and JH, HE = 0.6917 and HO= 0.7011. QH and JH had a genetic distance of 0.3831, and JH and AMH had a genetic distance of 0.2883. Of the three breeds, QH and JH formed clearly near groups and the AMH formed clearly different groups. This study is judged to be suitable for individual identification and parentage testing for registration of the lineage of AMH and QH. Therefore, the results of this study are an effective tool for genetic research and preservation of these horse breeds. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Rewilding incomplete ecosystems by using ungulate megaherbivores represents a significant potential for sustainable management of habitats of declining species. Two xeric grasslands patches in the Podyjí National Park, Czech Republic, were rewilded by a feral horse breed, the Exmoor pony, in 2018. Before this in 2017, demography, mobility, and adult habitat use of five congeneric Melitaea butterflies co-occurring at the grasslands were investigated (Vodickova et al., J. Nature Conserv. 2019). In 2021, four seasons after the rewilding, we replicated the survey to assess the effects of the horse on the butterflies. Here, we compare the results of the two surveys and investigate changes in spatial patterns of adult distribution using Ripley's K-functions. Total numbers of captures, and estimated population sizes, were consistently lower in 2021, with the largest drop for spring-flying M. cinxia. We cannot discern whether this was due to the cold 2021 spring, or due to reduction of grasses by the horse, possibly contributing to desiccation of M. cinxia host plants. Demographic parameters such as residency/longevity and capture probability changed only little. Mobility ranking among species remained identical, but within species, some mobility characteristics changed among years. Among early summer species, M. britomartis, second most abundant in 2017, switched to the first position with M. aurelia, and these two species displayed the most notable shift in adult habitat use between the two seasons. Short thorny shrubs avoided by the horse protect M. britomartis host plants; this threatened butterfly thus did not suffer from horse presence. M. athalia, a species of woodland edges, profited from decay of conifers caused by a series of dry years; and M. didyma, forming multiple generations, from increase of its host plant. Contrary to expectations, spatial distribution of most butterflies became more aggregated within rewilded pastures, probably due to regularities in home ranges use by the horses, which restructured the vegetation in a zonal, rather than patchy, way. A considerably larger areas should be rewilded by the herbivores to fully achieve the desired beneficial effects. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Cardiac biomarkers are useful to identify cardiac muscle variations in human and equine medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of a bout of show jumping training on serum activity of cardiac and muscular biomarkers in healthy athletic horses to include cardiac troponin (cTnI), myoglobin (MB), aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Serum samples were collected from seven Italian Saddle horses (three geldings and four mares; 10 ± 3 years; mean body weight 480 ±70 kg), regularly trained for show jumping at rest, immediately after exercise (show jumping simulate trial) and during the recovery period (30 and 60 min after exercise). ANOVA was applied to all parameters, and Pearson correlation coefficient t (r) evaluated. Immediately after exercise there was an increase in cTnI (P < .01), MB (P < .01), and CPK (P < .005); a positive correlation between cTnI and AST and between AST and LDH; and a negative correlation between cTnI and ALT and between ALT and CPK. Thirty minutes after exercise, there was a positive correlation between AST and ALT and between AST and LDH, while 60 mintues after exercise, there was a positive correlation between MB and LDH and a negative correlation between AST and CPK. The results obtained demonstrate the cardiac and muscular response to short-term intense exercise show jumping exercise. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Insect Bite Hypersensitivity (IBH, Queensland itch, sweet itch, equine summer eczema) is the most common pruritic disease of horses. It is most often caused by sensitivity to the saliva of Culicoides spp. of biting midges; however, it can also be caused by hypersensitivity to other insect species. The prevalence of IBH in horses is reported to be as high as 60% in some parts of the world. Due to the severe pruritus and effects of secondary self-trauma, IBH has animal welfare concerns, and there is currently no cure. Management of this condition is life-long, time consuming and costly. New grading systems to document disease severity are being validated, which will allow the comparison of clinical trial results of new and existing therapies. Management involves the minimisation of insect bites by use of stabling, fans, rugs and repellents. Symptomatic therapy involves the administration of systemic or topical corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and creams and sprays to promote skin healing and decrease inflammation. New immune-mediated therapeutics including vaccines, in addition to desensitisation procedures, show promise at controlling hypersensitivity reactions. This article will review aetiologic agents, pathophysiology, scoring systems and current and new therapies. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe a case of lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis in a horse. Animal Studied: A client-owned 12-year-old Standardbred gelding presenting with chronic conjunctivitis and palpebral masses. Methods: Complete ophthalmic examination, surgical excision, histopathology, and bacterial culture of biopsy samples were performed. Results: Upper and lower eyelids of both eyes were affected, with multiple yellow-to-white nodules on the palpebral conjunctiva, adjacent to the eyelid margin. Nodule removal was achieved via partial tarsal plate excision. Histopathological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation and large droplets of presumed free lipid in the conjunctival lamina propria. The animal was diagnosed with lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis. No postoperative ocular discomfort was observed for months; however, 3 years later, new conjunctival nodules were noticed, requiring a second surgical procedure on three of the eyelids. Transient entropion in the left lower eyelid was observed 2 months after the second surgery, and no recurrence of conjunctival nodules was observed after 18 months of follow-up. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis in horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Codeine and acetaminophen in combination have proven to be an effective analgesic treatment for moderate-to-severe and postoperative pain in humans. Studies have demonstrated that codeine and acetaminophen, when administered as sole agents, are well tolerated by horses. In the current study, we hypothesized that administration of the combination of codeine and acetaminophen would result in a significant thermal antinociceptive effect compared with administration of either alone. Six horses were administered oral doses of codeine (1.2 mg/kg), acetaminophen (20 mg/kg), and codeine plus acetaminophen (1.2 mg/kg codeine and 6–6.4 mg/kg acetaminophen) in a three-way balanced crossover design. Plasma samples were collected, concentrations of drug and metabolites determined via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. Pharmacodynamic outcomes, including effect on thermal thresholds, were assessed. Codeine Cmax and AUC were significantly different between the codeine and combination group. There was considerable inter-individual variation in the pharmacokinetic parameters for codeine, acetaminophen, and their metabolites in horses. All treatments were well tolerated with minimal significant adverse effects. An increase in the thermal threshold was noted at 1.5 and 2 h, from 15 min through 6 h and 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 3 h in the codeine, acetaminophen, and combination groups, respectively. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) are a major impediment to breeding and exploitation of horses. Traditional control of GIN has generated resistance to main anthelmintics, including ivermectin. An analysis of five ranches with a history of IVM use was done to determine the efficacy and resistance of GIN to IVM treatment in horses from the Mexican southeast. Predesigned questionnaires were applied to collect information on previous treatment protocols. The fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was applied to determine resistance. Before IVM application, a McMaster test was used to diagnose GIN infection in horses, and feces cultures were done to identify L3 larvae for Strongylida eggs. Pre-treatment samples showed that 72.7% (80/110) of horses were GIN positive, with cyathostomins being the most frequent (91.8%), followed by Oxyuris equi (7.0%), Parascaris equorum (1.0%), and Strongylus vulgaris (0.2%). Based on the results, the horses at each ranch were divided in control (CG) and experimental (EG) groups with similar eggs per gram of feces (EPG). The EG (40/80) was dewormed with IVM (0.2 mg/kg orally) and the CG (40/80) remained untreated. After 14 days, EPG were measured, and feces cultures were done again to identify L3 larvae. After treatment of EG, 40% (16/40) of horses were positive, the most frequently identified GIN were cyathostomins (98.6%), followed by P. equorum (1.0%) and S. vulgaris (0.2%). Three of the five ranches were classified as resistant, according to the FECRT, with a percentage of reduction from 53 to 68%, all of which used IVM ≥4 times annually. This is the first evidence of resistance in cyathostomins to IVM treatment in horses from the Mexican southeast, adding to the current problem of anthelmintic resistance in equine GIN. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Nowadays, developed more precisious identification techniques have allowed to validate newer enterococcal species. Among them, the species Enterococcus moraviensis was also validated, at first from surface waters. However, in this study, characteristics and potential to bacteriocin production by the strain E. moraviensis EMo 1-1Nik isolated from buccal mucosa of Slovak warm-blood horse breed has been studied. BLASTn analysis allotted this strain to the species E. moraviensis with percentage identity BLASTn 16S rRNA sequence in the strain up to 100% (99.93% similarity with E. moraviensis NR113937.1). The strain EMo 1-1Nik has been provided with GenBank accession number MW326085. It is hemolysis-negative (γ-hemolysis), deoxyribonuclease-negative and gelatinase-negative; absent of virulence factor genes, low-grade biofilm-positive (0.133 ± 0.36), mostly susceptible to tested antibiotics. Moreover, 60% of EMo1-1Nik colonies were found as bacteriocin-producing against the principal indicator Enterococcus avium EA5. The concentrated substance (CS, pH 4.5) of EMo1-1Nik showed the inhibitory activity against EA5 strain (800 AU/mL); CSs with pH 6.3 and 7.3 reached inhibitory activity 100 AU/mL against EA5 strain. CS was thermo-stable and it does not lost activity after enzymes treatment. Oppositelly, EMo 1-1Nik was susceptible to Mundticin EM 41/3 (800 AU/mL) produced by horse fecal strain E. mundtii EM 41/3 and enterocins (up to 51 200 AU/mL). In spite of the preliminary results, it has been shown a potential to produce bacteriocin substance of the safe strain E. moraviensis EMo1-1Nik.

ABSTRACT: Prosthetic laryngoplasty is a recognised treatment option for recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) in horses; however, there is no report of the use of laryngoplasty alone or in combination, as a successful treatment of equine laryngeal dysplasia. A 6-year-old Warmblood gelding was referred to the hospital for investigation of respiratory noise and exercise intolerance. Grade 4 recurrent laryngeal neuropathy and bilateral vocal fold collapse were diagnosed with overground endoscopy. Ultrasonography revealed laryngeal dysplasia. The horse underwent standing laser bilateral ventriculectomy, left vocal cordectomy, right vocal cordotomy and left-sided laryngoplasty. Abnormal structural anatomy of the left aspect of the larynx consistent with laryngeal dysplasia was identified during surgery. Post-operatively, the horse showed substantial clinical improvement with decreased respiratory noise and improved exercise capacity. Follow-up overground endoscopy at 6 months post-operative revealed Dixon grade 4 abduction of the left arytenoid cartilage. Follow-up information via telephone conversation with the owner confirmed that the horse continued in active exercise with clinical improvement. This case report highlights the value of combined clinical, endoscopic and ultrasonographic examinations of the larynx in a horse with laryngeal dysplasia and concurrent grade 4 RLN and the successful surgical treatment achieved with combined bilateral ventriculectomy, left vocal cordectomy, right vocal cordotomy and prosthetic laryngoplasty. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Obtaining a healthy wound environment that is conductive to healing in horses can be challenging. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been employed in humans to enhance wound healing for decades. The existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT remains uncertain in equine medicine. The aim of this review is to investigate NPWT applications and benefits in horses. A scoping review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews on three databases (PubMed, Web of Science-Thompson Reuters, and Wiley Online Library). Twenty-four manuscripts were considered. After removing duplicates, 17 papers underwent abstract screening. Of these, 16 + 1 (cited by others) were evaluated for eligibility according to PICOs, including no case reports/retrospective studies, four original articles, and three reviews. Fifteen manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. The focus of the articles was wound management; they included three reports of wounds communicating with synovial structures. Traumatic wounds and surgical-site infections are indications for NPWT. NPWT presents several advantages and few complications making it an attractive alternative to conventional wound management. However, randomized controlled trials should be performed to quantify the benefits and establish precise protocols in horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The German Society of Nutrition Physiology has proposed a new protein evaluation system for horse feeds to estimate pre-cecally digestible crude protein (pcdCP) and amino acids (pcdAA) from chemical properties. A total of 71 feeds for horses were chemically tested and evaluated according to the new protein evaluation system. A feeding trial with eight horses tested whether differences in estimated pcdAA and neutral detergent soluble CP (NDSCP) in the diet were reflected by post-prandial (ppr) kinetics of plasma lysine (Lys) by feeding a complementary feed (control = CTRL) with 1.02 g Lys/100 kg body weight (BW) as well as three diets with 3.02 g Lys/100 kg BW, as follows: (i) CTRL with synthetic AA (CTRL + synAA); (ii) CTRL with soybean meal (CTRL + SBM); and (iii) lucerne pellets (LUC). In comparison to CTRL, the areas of curves (AUCs) of ppr plasma Lys differed: CTRL < CTRL + SBM (p < 0.01) < CTRL + synAA (p < 0.05). For 71 feeds, the estimated pcdCP was correlated with the CP content (p < 0.001), NDSCP (p < 0.001), and ash-free neutral detergent fiber (p < 0.001). A mean neutral detergent insoluble CP content of at least 3–5% can be assumed in horse feed. It is speculated that the predicted availability of Lys from LUC seems to be underestimated by the new protein evaluating system. The influence of chewing and microbiota in vivo needs to be considered in horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study focuses on expanding knowledge about the genetic diversity of the Altai horse native to Siberia. While studying modern horses from two Altai regions, where horses were subjected to less crossbreeding, we tested the hypothesis, formulated on the basis of morphological data, that the Altai horse is represented by two populations (Eastern and Southern) and that the Mongolian horse has a greater genetic proximity to Eastern Altai horses. Bone samples of ancient horses from different cultures of Altai were investigated to clarify the genetic history of this horse breed. As a genetic marker, we chose hypervariable region I of mitochondrial DNA. The results of the performed phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of our and previously published data confirmed the hypothesis stated above. As we found out, almost all the haplotypes of the ancient domesticated horses of Altai are widespread among modern Altai horses. The differences between the mitochondrial gene pools of the ancient horses of Altai and Mongolia are more significant than between those of modern horses of the respective regions, which is most likely due to an increase in migration processes between these regions after the Early Iron Age. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Lusitano horse is gaining popularity in the equestrian world, and as a result, the significance of applied sports medicine for this breed is growing. As cardiology plays a crucial role in this field, numerous studies have been conducted to establish electrocardiographic reference values in various breeds to ensure a more accurate evaluation. However, studies regarding healthy Lusitano horses are lacking. So, this study aimed to establish electrocardiographic reference values for Lusitano horses, utilizing a sample of 82 clinically healthy animals. The evaluation involved lead II and base–apex lead measurements, with a median heart rate of 39 beats per minute being recorded. The P wave demonstrated a predominantly bifid configuration, while the QRS complex exhibited various forms. The most common QRS configurations were QR and R in lead II, and RS in the base–apex lead. Additionally, most T waves displayed a biphasic shape in both methods. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were noted based on age and gender. Some of the electrocardiographic values obtained differed from those previously published for other breeds. Given the relevance of electrocardiogram in cardiovascular evaluation, these findings bring valuable insights regarding the specific parameters for Lusitano horse and emphasize the importance of obtaining breed-specific electrocardiographic reference values. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually performed with 250–500 mL of isotonic saline at pH 5.5. The acidic pH of saline may cause an increase in airway neutrophil count 48 h after BAL. Other isotonic solutions such as Ringer’s solution, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Plasma-Lyte 148® have a neutral pH of 7.4 and might be a better choice for BAL by not provoking inflammation and the influx of neutrophils into airways. BAL was performed in four healthy horses in four different lung lobes using four different solutions in a randomized crossover design. In each lobe, BAL was performed twice with a 48 h interval using 250 mL of solution. Automated total nucleated cell counts (TNCs) were recorded, and differential cell counts in lavage fluid were determined by two investigators blinded to treatments. The mean volume of BAL fluid retrieved was 51 ± 14%. The mean neutrophil percentage (%N) increased from 1.5 ± 0.9% to 14.7 ± 9.6% at 48 h (p < 0.001) but was not significantly affected by the solution used or the lung lobe sampled. In conclusion, in this study, the influx of neutrophils into airways after BAL was independent of the type of isotonic solution used and the lung lobe sampled. Saline remains an appropriate solution for BAL in horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Trazodone, a serotonin receptor antagonist and reuptake inhibitor, might be a useful adjunctive treatment in the initial management of horses with acute laminitis if it minimizes ambulation or encourages recumbency. Objectives: (1) Evaluate the effects of PO trazodone on ambulatory activity and recumbency in healthy horses; and (2) assess the pharmacokinetics of multiple PO doses of trazodone. Animals/Methods: In a randomized cross-over design, 8 healthy horses received placebo or trazodone at 2 doses (2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg) PO q12h for 48 hours with a 14-day washout period between treatments. Forelimb step frequency was measured using a hoof-mounted accelerometer and continuous video monitoring was used to detect recumbency. Groups were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test. Trazodone and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) plasma concentrations were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and pharmacokinetics were analyzed using noncompartmental methods. Results: Step frequency was lower in horses receiving 7.5 mg/kg trazodone than in the control group (mean step reduction: 44% ± 11%). Steps-area under the curve were significantly lower in the 7.5 mg/kg group (mean ± SD: 3375 ± 525 steps × hour) as compared to the 2.5 mg/kg group (mean ± SD: 5901 ± 2232; P =.02) and compared to control (mean ± SD: 6590 ± 1241; P =.001). No difference was found in the number of recumbent episodes (P =.92) or total duration of recumbency (P =.9). Trazodone and m-CPP achieved steady-state concentrations, with an accumulation ratio of 1.45 ± 0.2. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Although it did not affect recumbency, trazodone at 7.5 mg/kg q12h decreased step frequency by approximately 44%. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is increasingly used to treat painful conditions in horses but its ocular penetration has not been studied. Objectives: To determine whether orally administered acetaminophen penetrates the aqueous humour of the normal equine eye and report an aqueous humour:serum acetaminophen concentration ratio in horses. Study design: In vivo experiment. Methods: Six privately owned horses with normal ophthalmic examinations weighing 568 ± 65 kg (mean ± standard deviation) and aged 11 ± 4 years were given 20 mg/kg acetaminophen orally every 12 h for a total of six doses. Physical exam parameters were recorded prior to, during, and after the dosing period. One hour after the final dose, horses were sedated and simultaneous aqueous humour and serum samples were collected and analysed for acetaminophen concentrations and selected eicosanoids. An aqueous humour:serum acetaminophen concentration ratio was calculated. A second aqueous humour sample was taken and analysed for eicosanoid concentrations 3 months after acetaminophen dosing. Physical exam data were compared between time points using a mixed model analysis (significance p < 0.05). Results: Acetaminophen was detected in both serum and aqueous humour of all horses and mean ± standard deviation aqueous humour:serum acetaminophen concentration ratio was 44.9 ± 15.9%. No significant changes in physical exam parameters occurred during or after dosing. Eicosanoids were not detected in aqueous humour at any sampling point. Main limitations: Presence of acetaminophen in the aqueous humour may not relate to clinical effect. A therapeutic level of acetaminophen has not been determined in horses, and the absence of ocular inflammation does not reflect conditions in which acetaminophen may be used. Conclusions: Acetaminophen readily penetrates the aqueous humour of the normal equine eye after consecutive oral dosing. Further study is required to determine whether acetaminophen is useful in the treatment of ocular pain and inflammation. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Lameness, discipline, training intensity, environmental variability, and shoeing are all factors demonstrated to affect hoof loading and therefore act as adaptive stimuli to alter hoof morphology. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of age at training initiation on hoof morphology and lameness incidence and determine if specific hoof morphology measurements correlate with lameness in juvenile American Quarter Horses. Study design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: American Quarter Horses (n = 42; 29 two-year-olds, 13 three-year-olds) entering training were monitored for hoof morphology and lameness over 6 months (months 0, 2, 4, and 6). Hoof measurements (palmar/plantar angles, frog base width/length, toe length/angle, heel length/angle, heel and foot width, wall height/angle) from radiographs and photographs were recorded. Lameness was graded subjectively and objectively (Lameness locator®). Statistical analyses were performed with Fisher's exact test and repeated measures ANOVA with p < 0.05. Results: 25/42 horses developed subclinical lameness (16/42 forelimb, 19/42 hindlimb), with 3-year-olds developing lameness more frequently compared to 2-year-olds overall (p = 0.04; 84.6 vs. 48.3%) and in forelimbs (p = 0.05; 61.5% vs. 27.6%); no difference was noted between 2- versus 3-year-olds in hindlimbs (p = 0.2; 61.5% vs. 37.9%). In lame versus sound forelimbs, 3-year-olds had decreased foot width (p = 0.03; 11.48 cm [CI 10.68–12.28] vs. 12.21 cm [CI 11.99–12.42]), decreased toe length (p = 0.03; 6.02 cm [CI 5.69–6.36] vs. 6.45 cm [CI 6.32–6.58]), shorter lateral wall height (p = 0.03; 4.64 cm [CI 4.31–4.96] vs. 5.11 cm [CI 5.03–5.2]), and shorter medial wall height (p = 0.02; 4.58 cm [CI 4.06–5.10] vs. 5.15 cm [CI 4.99–5.30]). In lame versus sound hindlimbs, horses overall (p = 0.05; 3.74, CI 3.53–3.96 vs. 3.55, CI 3.48–3.61) and 3-year-olds had longer heels p = 0.01; 3.90 cm (CI 3.5–4.3) vs. 3.50 cm (CI 3.39–3.61). Main limitations: Small sample size, lack of control group not entering training. Conclusions: Three-year-old American Quarter Horses entering training were more likely to develop forelimb lameness than 2-year-olds. This subclinical lameness was associated with specific hoof morphology characteristics (decreased foot width, toe length, heel length, and lateral/medial wall height; greater toe angle). © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The bioaccumulation of heavy metals (HMs) in marine fish is a growing global concern due to potential human health risks. The study analyzed HM in the muscle tissue, gills, and gut of adult male and female cape horse mackerel and slinger seabream caught in the polluted Durban Basin and pristine Cape Vidal from April 2018 to February 2019. Results revealed interspecific, spatial, and organ-specific variability in HM levels. In the Durban Basin, slinger seabream had bioaccumulation (in mg/kg) of As (2.3 ± 0.2), Cr (2.6 ± 0.2), Ni (2.0 ± 0.1), and Pb (4.1 ± 0.3) while cape horse mackerel had Ni (1.6 ± 0.2), Pb (4.7 ± 0.6), and Zn (52 ± 3.01) exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) regulatory limits. Metal pollution index (MPI) values were also higher in Durban Basin (> 5.13) than Cape Vidal (< 3.32) for both species’ muscles. Liver and gills of slinger seabream and gut of cape horse mackerel exhibited higher HM accumulation patterns proportionate to the environmental concentrations, indicating the bioindicative potential of HM pollution by the two species. Risk assessment indicated that both fish species had target hazard quotient > 1 for Cr, and target cancer risk < 10–4 for Pb, implying significant potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks associated with fish consumption from the Durban Basin. The study recommends daily consumption limits of 16 g/day for slinger seabream and 14 g/day for cape horse mackerel to ensure health safety. The findings contribute to the understanding of HM pollution in the Durban Basin and provide important information for decision-makers and policymakers in developing effective strategies to mitigate and manage HM contamination in fish populations. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Purpose: In an oncological set up the role of frozen section biopsy is undeniable. They serve as an important tool for surgeon’s intraoperative decision making but the diagnostic reliability of intraoperative frozen section may vary from institute to institute. The surgeon should be well aware of the accuracy of the frozen section reports in their setup to enable them to take decisions based on the report. This is why we had conducted a retrospective study at Dr B. Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam, India to find out our institutional frozen section accuracy. Methods: The study was conducted from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2022 (5 years). All gynaecology oncology patients who were operated on during the study period and had an intraoperative frozen section done were included in the study. Patients who had incomplete final histopathological report (HPR) or no final HPR were excluded from the study. Frozen section and final histopathology report were compared and analysed and discordant cases were analysed based on the degree of discordancy. Results: For benign ovarian disease, the IFS accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 96.7%, 100% and 93%, respectively. For borderline ovarian disease the IFS accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 96.7%, 80% and 97.6%, respectively. For malignant ovarian disease the IFS accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 95.4%, 89.1% and 100%, respectively. Sampling error was the most common cause of discordancy. Conclusion: Intraoperative frozen section may not have 100% diagnostic accuracy but still it is the running horse of our oncological institute. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) associated with herpesvirus-5 infection (EHV-5), is a severe, fibrosing interstitial lung disease of horses. Most common reported clinical signs are pyrexia, weight loss, depression, respiratory distress with tachypnoea and cough. Multiple tissue tropism of the EHV-5 has been suggested. Treatment with valacyclovir and corticosteroids has been reported to be successful in a few cases, but the disease is usually associated with a poor prognosis because of progressive impairment of respiratory function. Corticosteroid administration can carry potential side effects, such as hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression, laminitis and increased susceptibility to infections. This report described a case of an 11-year-old gelding diagnosed with EMPF. The horse was treated with valacyclovir and corticosteroids and, after a transient initial improvement, showed a rapid deterioration of clinical signs and multiple complications, including severe bacterial dermatitis, liver damage and pleural effusion of unknown origin. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of liver biopsy sample was positive for EHV-5, confirming the virus' multiple tissue tropism. A role of corticosteroids in exacerbating the disease progression and the increasing susceptibility to infections was strongly suspected. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Arabian horse breed is well known for its purity and played a key role in the genetic improvement of other horses worldwide. The mitochondrial genome plays a vital role in maternal inheritance and it's helpful to evaluate its genetic diversity and conservation. It has higher mutation rates than nuclear DNA in vertebrates and therefore reveals phylogenetic relationships and haplotypes. In this study, the mitochondrial genome mutations in two Saudi horse strains, Kehilan and Hamdani demonstrated various changes in the gene and amino acid levels and included two other Saudi horses (Hadban and Seglawi) from the previous study for phylogenetic comparison. The whole mitochondrial genome sequencing resulted in intra and inter mtDNA variations between the studied horses. Interestingly, the Hamdani horse has nucleotide substitutions similar to those of the Hadban horse, which is reflected in the phylogenetic tree as a significantly close relationship. This type of study provides a better understanding of mitogenome structure and conservation of livestock species genetic data. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Objective: To compare the measurement of intraocular pressure in horses with clinical ocular disease using three tonometry devices. Animals Studied: A total of fifty horses were presented to the New Bolton Center Ophthalmology Service. Procedure: Intraocular pressure was taken on 50 client-owned horses (100 eyes) using the TonoVet, TonoVet Plus and Tono-Pen Avia tonometers. Clinical equine patients included were presented to New Bolton Center for ophthalmic examination. Auriculopalpebral blocks were performed but horses were unsedated. Results: All three tonometers were found to have strong agreement among them. The strongest agreement was between the TonoVet and the TonoVet Plus with the TonoVet on average 1.330 mmHg less than the TonoVet Plus (standard deviation 4.388 mmHg). This was followed by the TonoVet and the Tono-Pen Avia Vet with the TonoVet on average 2.531 mmHg greater than the Tono-Pen Avia Vet (standard deviation 4.124 mmHg). The weakest agreement was between the TonoVet Plus and the Tono-Pen Avia with the TonoVet Plus on average 3.854 mmHg greater than the Tono-Pen Avia (standard deviation 4.724 mmHg). Conclusions: All three tonometers showed strong agreement, however, the TonoVet and the TonoVet Plus carried the strongest agreement with the TonoVet Plus having slightly higher measurements overall compared with the TonoVet. Due to small variations between devices, it is recommended that the same device be used for serial measurements of intraocular pressure. However, all three devices are appropriate to use in horses presented for ophthalmic evaluation. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate a point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation monitor (VCM Vet) for use in horses by assessing variability between devices and establish reference intervals (RIs) for healthy adult horses. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Two university teaching hospitals. Animals: Healthy adult horses (n = 68). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Blood collected by direct jugular venipuncture was applied directly from the syringe into 2 VCM Vet cassettes to establish coefficients of variation (CVs) and RIs for reported parameters of clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle, amplitude at 10 and 20 minutes, maximum clot firmness, and lysis index at 30 and 45 minutes. CVs for each parameter were within clinical tolerance. There was a significant difference in CT between institutions (P < 0.001). Differences in CV were found between institutions for CT (P = 0.003) and CFT (P = 0.01). Healthy horse RIs were calculated for the overall data set and each individual institution. Calculated RIs were as follows: CT, 255.6–1233.9 seconds; CFT, 89.4–581 seconds; alpha angle, 11.4–53.6°; maximum clot firmness, 18–37.7; lysis index at 30 minutes, 97.3%–102.1%; lysis index at 45 minutes, 80.8%–103.3%; amplitude at 10 minutes, 8.7–28.3; and amplitude at 20 minutes, 17.4–35.7. Conclusions: VCM Vet is a repeatable and practical option for rapid point-of-care assessment of hemostasis in horses but has a wide RI and is susceptible to variability. Establishment of institution-specific RIs is recommended. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2023.

ABSTRACT: Myeloma-related disorders, including multiple myeloma, extramedullary plasmacytoma, and solid osseous plasmacytoma, are rare in horses. Clinical complaints for myeloma-related disorders are nonspecific, and when present, M-protein location is more variable on protein electrophoresis in horses relative to dogs and cats. Here, we describe a case of a 15-year-old Thoroughbred mare who presented with recurrent blepharitis. Marked hyperglobulinemia was an incidental finding on routine hematologic and biochemical testing. Bone marrow aspiration consisted of >30% plasma cells, and serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated a monoclonal gammopathy in the alpha 2 fraction leading to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Immunofixation and radial immunodiffusion confirmed the presence of an IgG M-protein. Based on a restricted peak in the alpha 2 location, the specific M-protein is suspected to be IgG(T), an IgG isotype unique to horses. M-protein migration in horses is variable relative to dogs and cats, yet immunofixation can still be used to identify equine IgG M-protein isotypes. The unique clinical presentation in this case also serves as a reminder to consider neoplasia in horses with unusual or nonspecific clinical signs. © 2023 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.

ABSTRACT: Background: Additional efficacious immunomodulatory treatment is needed for the management of immune-mediated disease in horses. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug that warrants assessment as a viable therapeutic agent for horses. Hypothesis/Objectives: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple-day oral dosing of MMF in healthy horses and to determine the tolerability of this dosing regimen. Animals: Six healthy Standardbred mares. Methods: Horses received MMF 10 mg/kg PO q12h for 7 days in the fed state. Serial sampling was performed over 12 hours on Days 1 and 7 with trough samples collected every 24 hours, immediately before morning drug administration. Noncompartmental PK analyses were performed to determine primary PK parameters, followed by calculation of geometric means and coefficients of variation. A CBC, serum biochemical profile, physical examination, and fecal scoring were used to assess dose tolerability. Results: Seven days of treatment resulted in a mycophenolic acid (MPA) area under the curve (AUC0-12) of 12 594 h × ng/mL (8567-19 488 h × ng/mL) and terminal half-life (T1/2) of 11.3 hours (7.5-15.9 hours), yielding minor metabolite accumulation in all horses treated. Salmonellosis was detected in the feces of 2 horses by Day 7, and all horses developed myelosuppression, hyperbilirubinemia, hyporexia, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and decreased fecal output by the seventh day of treatment. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Administration of MMF at 10 mg/kg PO q12h resulted in hematologic and clinical toxicity within 1 week of treatment. A decreased MMF dose, frequency, or both is needed to avoid colic. Drug monitoring should include frequent hemograms, serum biochemical profiles, and strict biosecurity protocols. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Mutations causing depigmentation are relatively common in Equus caballus (horse). Over 40 alleles in multiple genes are associated with increased white spotting (as of February 2023). The splashed white phenotype, a coat spotting pattern described as appearing like the horse has been splashed with white paint, was previously associated with variants in the PAX3 and MITF genes. Both genes encode transcription factors known to control melanocyte migration and pigmentation. We report two novel mutations, a stop-gain mutation in PAX3 (XM_005610643.3:c.927C>T, ECA6:11,196,181, EquCab3.0) and a missense mutation in a binding domain of MITF (NM_001163874.1:c.993A>T, ECA16:21,559,940, EquCab3.0), each with a strong association with increased depigmentation in Pura Raza Española horses (P = 1.144E-11, N = 30, P = 4.441E-16, N = 39 respectively). Using a quantitative method to score depigmentation, the PAX3 and MITF mutations were found to have average white scores of 25.50 and 24.45, respectively, compared to the average white coat spotting score of 1.89 in the control set. The functional impact for each mutation was predicted to be moderate to extreme (I-TASSER, SMART, Variant Effect Predictor, SIFT). We propose to designate the MITF mutant allele as Splashed White 9 and the PAX3 mutant allele as Splashed White 10 per convention. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate the effects of feeder style (trough vs. individual pans) on behaviors and plasma cor- tisol in group-fed horses. Materials and Methods: Horses (n = 16) were blocked by sex and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mixed gelding/mare groups or a mare group in a crossover de- sign. Groups were offered 0.9 kg of alfalfa pellets per horse in either a centrally located trough (TR) or individual pans (IP) spaced a minimum of 20 m apart. Blood samples were obtained 10 min before feeding (PRE), immediately after feed completion or abandonment (POST), and 30 min after feeding (P30), and were later assayed for plasma cortisol. Behaviors were observed and recorded by 2 expe- rienced observers. Behavior scores (calculated as weighted dominant minus weighted submissive) were used to cat- egorize individuals as dominant, submissive, or neutral. Results and Discussion: When not considering be- havior score, cortisol concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) before feeding compared with after feeding, and there was no effect of feeder style (P > 0.3). When TR fed, behavior classification influenced cortisol concentrations over time. Dominant horses had greater cortisol concen- trations before feeding compared with POST (P < 0.01) and P30 (P < 0.05), whereas no differences over time were observed in submissive horses. Implications and Applications: These data suggest that feeder style does not influence plasma cortisol concen- trations; however, anticipation of feeding with associated agonistic interactions may be a source of stress in group- fed horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Living in a herd has multiple advantages for social species and is a primary survival strategy for prey. The presence of conspecifics, identified as a social buffer, may mitigate the individual stress response. Social isolation is, therefore, particularly stressful for horses, which are gregarious animals. However, they are not equally vulnerable to separation from the group. We tested whether more and less socially dependent horses and independent individuals would differ in their responses to novel and sudden sounds occurring in two contexts: non-social and social motivation. Twenty warmblood horses were first exposed to two social tests: to evaluate the level of social dependence (rate of restless behaviour; social isolation) and the quantity and the quality of interactions in which they were involved (stay on a paddock). Two fear audio tests were then performed to compare the responses to sudden sounds while feeding (non-social motivation; control trial) and while moving towards the herd (social motivation; experimental trial). Socially dependent horses showed more pronounced avoidance behaviour and needed much more time to resume feeding during the control trial. Hence, dependent individuals appeared to be more fearful. However, during an experimental trial, horses of both groups tended to ignore the sound or paid only limited attention to the stimulus, continuing to move forward towards their conspecifics. Thus, social motivation may mitigate fear caused by a frightening stimulus and make fearful and dependent horses more prone to face a potentially stressful event. This finding should be taken into account in horse training and management. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The concept of "type host"denotes the host with which the holotype (or equivalent) of a parasitic species was associated at the time of collection. This concept is often erroneously conflated with the concept of a "natural host(s)", which refers to the host(s) with which the parasite species is naturally and normally associated in the wild. In cases where these two concepts are not kept apart, and when parasites like lice (Phthiraptera) are believed to be strictly host specific, a culture of identification by host association may develop. Here, I look at the consequences of such a case, the recent rejection of Philopterus reguli Denny, 1842 as the valid name of the louse species that normally parasitizes Regulus regulus (Linnaeus, 1758), and the erection of a new name for this taxon, which was subsequently synonymized with the new name based on a proposed neotype for Ph. reguli. I discuss the history of Philopterus reguli, the known specimens of this species, and the present controversy, as well as the validity of the neotype designation. In conclusion, the neotype designation of Ph. reguli is rejected, as it has not been shown that the syntype is unidentifiable, suspicious, or otherwise invalid, and a change in nomenclature has not been shown to be a problem for the stability of taxonomy. Moreover, the neotype designation is invalidated by at least three separate violations of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. I call for more care in both specimen identification and louse taxonomy and open up for a discussion about how the louse research community can move forward together on the issue of poorly described species.  © 2023 Gustafsson D.R.

ABSTRACT: Congential amastia, a medical condition in which mammary tissue fails to develop, was detected in a 3-year-old Quarter Horse mare. The dam of the mare was also afflicted with amastia, suggesting that the condition was due to an inherited genetic mutation as noted in other species. In addition, on presentation the mare had a purulent vaginal discharge secondary to a pyometra. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy, a marker of neuroaxonal damage, is increased in horses with equine neuroaxonal dystrophy. However, the temporal dynamics of this biomarker during the post-natal risk period are not understood. Objective: To measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated neurofilament heavy concentrations in juvenile foals across the post-natal window of susceptibility for equine neuroaxonal dystrophy. Study design: Case–control in vivo experimental study. Methods: Concentrations of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy were measured using frozen serum and cerebrospinal fluid collected from 13 foals raised in a vitamin E deficient environment from 1 to 6 months of age. Four of these foals were produced by equine neuroaxonal dystrophy-affected dams, developed clinical signs consistent with equine neuroaxonal dystrophy and had a diagnosis confirmed by histopathology. The remaining nine foals, produced by healthy mares, were vitamin E depleted and remained clinically healthy. An additional cohort of foals, produced by healthy mares, were supplemented with vitamin E (α-tocopherol; α-TOH) from birth and sampled similarly. Results: Serum α-TOH concentrations were significantly higher in vitamin E supplemented healthy foals. Serum phosphorylated neurofilament heavy concentrations did not differ significantly between groups at any time point. Cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated neurofilament heavy concentrations increased with age in healthy vitamin E depleted foals (p < 0.001); an effect that was not observed in healthy vitamin E supplemented foals. Main limitations: A genetically susceptible cohort supplemented with vitamin E was not available for comparison. Conclusion: We demonstrate that vitamin E depletion may elevate cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated neurofilament heavy in otherwise healthy juvenile foals by 6 months of age. We highlight an important cofactor to consider when interpreting cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated neurofilament heavy concentrations in juvenile horses. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Severe ophthalmic conditions such as trauma, uveitis, corneal damage, or neoplasia can lead to eye removal surgery. Poor cosmetic appearance resulting from the sunken orbit ensues. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing a custom-made 3D-printed orbital implant made of biocompatible material for the enucleated horse and usable in conjunction to a corneoscleral shell. Blender, a 3D-image software, was used for prototype design. Twelve cadaver heads of adult Warmbloods were collected from the slaughterhouse. On each head, one eye was removed via a modified transconjunctival enucleation while the contralateral eye was kept intact as control. Ocular measurements were collected on each enucleated eye with the help of a caliper and used for prototype sizing. Twelve custom-made biocompatible porous prototypes were 3D-printed in BioMed Clear resin using the stereolithography technique. Each implant was fixated into the corresponding orbit, within the Tenon capsule and conjunctiva. Heads were frozen and thin slices were then cut in the transverse plane. A scoring system based on four criteria (space for ocular prosthesis, soft-tissue-coverage, symmetry to the septum, and horizontal symmetry), ranging from A (proper fixation) to C (poor fixation), was developed to evaluate implantation. The prototypes reached our expectations: 75% of the heads received an A score, and 25% a B score. Each implant cost approximately 7.30€ and took 5 hours for 3D-printing. The production of an economically accessible orbital implant made of biocompatible porous material was successful. Further studies will help determine if the present prototype is usable in vivo. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Horse domestication and breed selection processes have profoundly influenced the development and transformation of human society and civilization over time. Therefore, their origin and history have always attracted much attention. In Italy, several local breeds have won prestigious awards thanks to their unique traits and socio-cultural peculiarities. Here, for the first time, we report the genetic variation of three loci of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) of four local breeds and another one (Lipizzan, UNESCO) well-represented in the Italian Peninsula. The analysis also includes data from three Sardinian breeds and another forty-eight Eurasian and Mediterranean horse breeds retrieved from GenBank for comparison. Three haplotypes (HT1, HT2, and HT3) were found in Italian stallions, with different spatial distributions between breeds. HT1 (the ancestral haplotype) was frequent, especially in Bardigiano and Monterufolino, HT2 (Neapolitan/Oriental wave) was found in almost all local breeds, and HT3 (Thoroughbred wave) was detected in Maremmano and two Sardinian breeds (Sardinian Anglo-Arab and Sarcidano). This differential distribution is due to three paternal introgressions of imported stallions from foreign countries to improve local herds; however, further genetic analyses are essential to reconstruct the genetic history of native horse breeds, evaluate the impact of selection events, and enable conservation strategies. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The ideal equestrian body image (BI) is a smaller physique and riders feel body shape (BS) influences subjective judge scoring within dressage competitions. The aims were to identify perceptions of equestrian coaches and dressage judges of rider body shape (BS), identify perceptions of appropriate horse-rider matching and establish the impact of BS on perceived rider ability. An online survey (GoogleFormsTM) was shared, respondents (n = 265, coaches = 174 judges = 91) viewed images of twelve riders of different BS (Ectomorph, Mesomorph, and Endomorph) mounted on three horses of different breeds/types and asked to indicate the best horse–rider match. Judges were asked if body shape or inappropriate horse-rider matching influenced scores given, this was used to identify any bias from judges. A significant perception for horse rider matching identified the cob as the most appropriate for the Endomorph physique (P < .001). Ectomorph was the most chosen as the ideal BS on all horses. Both coaches and judges identified the ideal physique as a smaller image from the BI scale. Both coaches and judges individually perceive that BS impacts rider ability (P < .001). These findings of BS perceived as linked to rider skill potentially identifies an issue and may correspond to the smaller physique being idealistic. Future research into physique related bias from judges is required to further identify the impact of BS on subjective judging within equestrian sport. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Bacteria belonging to the genus Mycoplasma are small-sized, have no cell walls and small genomes. They commonly cause respiratory disorders in their animal hosts. Three species have been found in the respiratory tract of horses worldwide, that is., Mycoplasma (M.) equirhinis, M. pulmonis and M. felis, but their role in clinical cases remains unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to i) develop and validate tools to detect, isolate and identify different Mycoplasma spp. strains in clinical equine respiratory-tract specimens and ii) subsequently define the prevalence of the three species in France depending on sample types and horse characteristics (age, breed, sex). Study design: Validation of a workflow for mycoplasma diagnosis and subsequent prevalence study. Methods: Mycoplasma-free tracheal wash samples spiked with numerated strains and DNA dilutions were used to validate the culture methods and real-time PCR (rt-PCR) assay. Isolated strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Prevalences were determined on a population of 616 horses with respiratory disorders, sampled in France in 2020. Results: In total, 104 horses (16.9%) were found to be positive for Mycoplasma spp. by at least one method. M. equirhinis was the predominant circulating species, accounting for 85% of the rt-PCR-positive samples and 98% of the 40 cultured strains. Main limitation: The proposed pre-enrichment procedure improves the sensitivity of detection but hinders the quantification of the initial mycoplasma load in the clinical specimens. Conclusions: Prevalence of mycoplasma varied with age, breed, and type of sample. © 2022 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Horses often present negative emotional states which are frequently poorly recognised, with much of our understanding of horse expressions based on anecdotes, rather than scientific evidence. The aim of this project was to identify potential facial markers of emotional states. 31 horses, aged between 2 and 23 years old (mean ± SD: 11.5 years, ± 6.6) and various genders (1 male, 10 geldings and 20 females) took part in the study. They were tested in three different scenarios involving the potential availability of food. Horses were trained to anticipate a reward after 10 s and then tested across the following three situations. Anticipation of a reward, considered a positive emotional state; frustration at waiting for a reward and disappointment at the loss of the reward - both considered negative emotional states. Tests were conducted in a stable with a feeding device fixed outside the stable within reach of the horse. Analysis of video recordings of facial expressions of the horses was undertaken using the Horse Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS), an objective system for coding facial movements on the basis of the contraction of underlying muscles, as well as their behaviours. Specific facial markers associated with anticipation could not be characterised, however, we found that the occurrence of 9 actions and behaviours differed significantly between the two situations predicted to induce frustration and disappointment during the feeding period. The frustration phase was characterised by a higher likelihood of ‘eye white increase’ (AD1), ‘ear rotator’ (EAD104), and ‘biting feeder’ compared to the ‘disappointment’ situations. By contrast, ‘blink’ (AU145), ‘nostril lift’ (AUH13), ‘tongue show’ (AD19), ‘chewing’ (AD81) and ‘licking feeder’ were more likely in the ‘disappointment’ phase than in the ‘frustration’ situation. There was also a general gender effect with females more likely to blink than males. The findings of this research may help differentiate frustration and disappointment at least during the feeding period. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) caused by Sarcocystis neurona remains an antemortem diagnostic challenge in some horses. Recent work suggested the use of real-time PCR (rtPCR) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a promising diagnostic tool. Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of S. neurona rtPCR on CSF for EPM diagnosis using horses with EPM and S. neurona-seropositive horses with other neurologic conditions. Animals: Ninety-nine horses with neurologic disease that underwent complete neurologic examination, CSF collection, and, if euthanized, necropsy including the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: Retrospective case-control study using banked CSF samples. Samples from horses with neurologic abnormalities and necropsy-confirmed EPM diagnosis, presumptive EPM diagnosis using strict criteria (SnSAG2/4/3 ELISA serum:CSF titer ratios <50) and horses diagnosed with other neurologic diseases were used. Results: Fifty-two horses had EPM; 23 were confirmed on necropsy, and 29 were presumptive clinical diagnoses. The other 47 horses all had necropsy-confirmed diagnoses. Four of the 47 horses had normal neurologic findings on necropsy and the remaining 43 horses had neurologic diseases including equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (EDM), cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy, trauma, and other miscellaneous conditions. One CSF sample was weakly positive for S. neurona by rtPCR, this sample was obtained from a horse with confirmed EDM. Samples from the other 98 horses were negative for S. neurona by rtPCR. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Our study contradicts previous conclusions that S. neurona rtPCR is potentially useful for EPM diagnosis, because our results indicate that the assay has a low sensitivity (0%) for EPM. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Ileus is a common life-threatening problem in horses, and currently available treatments may be ineffective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether bit chewing, a form of sham feeding, decreases the gastric emptying time (GET), small intestinal transit time (SITT), and total orocecal transit time (OCTT) in clinically normal horses in a prospective crossover study. Nine healthy horses were acclimated and fed a standardized diet. Following 24 h of fasting, self-contained video endoscopy capsules and acetaminophen were administered into the stomach via a nasogastric tube. Each horse underwent experimental (bit chewing for 20 min every 6 h) or control (no bit chewing) conditions, with a 3-week minimum washout period between conditions. The horses were enrolled in either part of the study until all video capsules were retrieved and/or 30 days lapsed. The video capsules were recovered from manure, and GET, SITT, and OCTT were determined from a video analysis. Bit chewing significantly decreased OCTT (p = 0.015) compared to the control conditions. Bit chewing decreased GET and SITT, but the differences were not significant. The mean (median) times determined via the video capsule analysis for the bit-chewing conditions were as follows: GET, 2.34 h (2.86 h); SITT, 3.22 h (3.65 h); and OCTT, 5.13 h (6.15 h), and for the control conditions, they were as follows: GET, 3.93 h (5 h); SITT, 3.79 h (4.4 h); and OCTT, 8.02 h (9.92 h). Bit chewing decreased OCTT in healthy horses. Because this segment of the gastrointestinal tract is frequently affected by ileus, bit chewing may be a safe and inexpensive intervention for that condition in horses. Further investigation in clinical patients with ileus is warranted. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Transportation of horses on short journeys can lead to an increase in stress. There are known age-associated changes in immune and metabolic responses in horses; however, no research exists evaluating how age may influence these responses to transportation stress. Eleven mares within two age groups, aged (n = 5, 22 ± 1 year) or young (n = 6, 2 ± 1 year), were transported 1 hour and 20 minutes. Peripheral blood and saliva were collected before and after transportation at baseline (2 to 3 weeks prior to transportation), 24 hours pre-transport, 1 hour before loading, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 to 3 hours, 24 hours and 8 days post-transport. Heart rates, rectal temperatures, under the tail temperatures, serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, serum insulin, salivary cortisol and salivary IL-6 were measured. Whole blood gene expression of the cytokines IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ, and TNFα were determined through qPCR, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, stimulated, and stained to determine IFNγ and TNFα production. Serum cortisol (P < .0001), salivary cortisol (P < .0001) and heart rate (P = .0002) increased in response to transportation with no age differences. Rectal (P = .03) and under the tail temperatures (P = .02) were increased in young versus aged horses. ACTH was higher in aged horses (P = .007) and post-transportation (P = .0001). Aged horses showed a greater increase in insulin compared with young horses (P < .0001). While age does not seem to impact cortisol responses to short-term transportation in horses, it did influence the post transportation insulin response to stress in aged horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Macleaya cordata extract (MCE), a phytogenic additive, is used in various species because of its multiple biological effects. These effects are linked especially to its major active compound sanguinarine, an isoquinoline alkaloid. To date, there is little information on its effects on horses. Our objectives were to determine whether a commercial MCE phytogenic additive is safe for horses and evaluate the effects of increasing inclusion rates of it on gut health and systemic inflammation of horses fed with a high-starch diet. The study design was a contemporary double 4 × 4 Latin square design. Eight healthy gelding ponies were used (8 experimental units per treatment, and a total of 32 experimental units). Dry matter intake was 1.75% body weight (BW) and starch intake was 2.2 g/kg BW per meal. Horses were randomly assigned into four treatments: Control, without MCE; S1, 1 mg MCE/kg BW; S1.5, 1.5 mg MCE/kg BW; and S2, 2 mg MCE/kg BW. Feed safety was determined by hemogram, leucogram, serum biochemical, and oxidative stress analyses. Systemic inflammation was measured by fibrinogen and gene expression of interleukins (IL) 6 and 10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The thickness of the right dorsal colon (RDC) wall was examined by abdominal ultrasonography as a variable related to gut health. Data were analyzed by PROC MIXED of SAS, and the means were compared using Tukey's test at 5% significance. RDC wall thickness, fibrinogen, IL-6, and IL-10 were analyzed by orthogonal polynomials and Pearson correlation. Serum albumin presented a lower value in S2 (2.97 g/dL) when compared to Control (3.10 g/dL) (P = 0.005), but albumin/globulin relation was not different among treatments. In orthogonal polynomial analyses, there were no differences among the systemic inflammatory variables; only RDC wall thickness values presented a linear response (R² = 0.223; P = 0.001). Pearson correlation showed a strong positive and significant correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 (R = 0.818; P < 0.001). The commercial MCE is safe for horses up to doses of 2 mg/kg. No systemic anti-inflammatory effects were observed, but the thinner intestinal wall in supplemented horses showed that the phytogenic additive had a local effect.

ABSTRACT: Supplementation with marine-derived n−3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n−3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n−3) is linked to beneficial health effects in both humans and horses. Krill oil (KO), which is extracted from the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), is well documented as a safe and biologically available dietary supplement in humans and several animal species, but there is a lack of documentation regarding its effect as a dietary ingredient for horses. The objective of this study was to test whether KO as a dietary supplement had the ability to raise horse red blood cell (RBC) membrane EPA and DHA, expressed as the n−3 index. Five nonworking Norwegian cold-blooded trotter horse geldings (body weight [BW]: 567 ± 38 kg) were supplemented with KO (10 mL/100 kg BW) for 35 days in a longitudinal study. Blood samples were analysed for RBC membrane fatty acid (FA) profile, haematology and serum biochemistry every 7th day. KO was well accepted by all horses, and no adverse health effects were observed during the 35-day trial period. KO supplementation affected the RBC membrane FA profile by increasing the n−3 index from Day 0 to 35 (Day 0: 0.53% vs. Day 35: 4.05% of total RBC FAs). The observed increase in the sum of EPA and DHA (p < 0.001), total n−3 FAs (p < 0.001) and the reduction of n−6 FAs (p < 0.044) resulted in a lower n–6:n−3 ratio (p < 0.001) by Day 35 of KO supplementation. In conclusion, the RBC n−3 index was increased and the general n−6:n−3 ratio was decreased in horses receiving 35-day dietary KO supplementation. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Packed cell volume (PCV) is important for assessing a patient's health status. Some blood gas analyzers measure hematocrit, and the agreement with PCV varies among different analyzers. Objectives: We aimed to determine the agreement between PCV measured by microcentrifugation and hematocrit measured by the Cobas b121 blood gas analyzer in dogs, cats, and horses. Methods: Whole blood samples for PCV and blood gas analysis were collected in lithium-heparin syringes and analyzed within 10 min of collection. Agreement and association between the PCV and Cobas b121 generated hematocrit were assessed by the Bland–Altman method, Pearson's correlation, Deming regression analysis, and paired t tests. A total allowable error of 10% was used for the analysis. Results: This study included 45 dogs, 45 cats, and 33 horses. The respective mean ± SD (minimum-maximum) of PCVs and hematocrits were: dogs, 34.9 ± 9.9% (9.0–55.0) and 32.5 ± 8.8% (10.4–50.6); cats, 29.0 ± 9.6% (11.0–51.0) and 26.9 ± 9.3% (10.2–50.9); horses, 34.2 ± 6.5% (24.0–47.0) and 34.1 ± 6.0% (22.5–46.1). There were no significant differences between the methods. The bias ± SD was: dogs, −2.4 ± 2.6%; cats, −2.2 ± 2.3%; horses, −0.1 ± 2.4%. Pearson's correlation coefficients were > 0.90 for all species (P < 0.0001). In 60%, 49%, and 85% of the samples for dogs, cats, and horses, respectively, the percentage differences between the methods were within 10%. Conclusions: The Cobas b121 blood gas analyzer provided accurate estimates of PCVs in horses. However, in dogs and cats, there was a large frequency of unacceptable differences between the methods. © 2023 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.

ABSTRACT: Background: Minerals play vital roles in physiologic processes. Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are common minerals. Secretion, absorption and homeostasis of these minerals are affected by associations between the active vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Objective: The aim of this study was to assess concentrations of vitamin D, PTH and minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus and magnesium in horse sera, as well as associations of these values with lameness in horses. In the references, the reasons for lameness can be deficiency and imbalance of minerals, and clinical observations also confirm this and there is still not enough information regarding the relationship between mineral imbalance and lameness of horses. The prominent forms of lameness include navicular syndrome, back pain, splints, ring bone, side bone, non-infectious arthritis and bucked shins. Deficiency and inadequacy of calcium, phosphorous and magnesium have been regarded as predisposing and aggravating factors of the aforementioned diseases. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 60 horses, including 30 lame and 30 healthy adult horses, summer to fall 2021. Levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D and PTH were assessed in sera using automatic analyser, atomic absorption spectroscopy and commercially available kits. Results: The average level of calcium was higher healthy horses than lame horses in the two seasons (p < 0.001). The average level of inorganic phosphorus in horses was higher in summer than autumn (p < 0.001). The mean magnesium concentration in healthy horses was greater than lame horses in the two seasons (p < 0.01). In this study, the mean PTH concentration in healthy horses was lower in fall than summer (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The low average levels of calcium and magnesium in lame horses in the two seasons indicate critical roles of calcium and magnesium in the normal function of the horse musculoskeletal system as well as prevention of lameness. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Trypanosoma evansi is a protozoan parasite that can infect a wide range of animals and is widespread around the world. In this study, we analyzed four fatal cases of T. evansi infection using clinical, parasitological, and molecular approaches. We also explored the genetic diversity, demographic history, and population-genetic structure of T. evansi using available Rode Trypanozoon antigenic type (RoTat) 1.2 gene sequences. Methods and results: Clinical findings of infected animals revealed high fever, anemia, weakness, and anorexia. The animals were treated with diminazene aceturate, which was moderately effective, and hematobiochemical parameters showed changes in hemoglobin and glucose levels. The molecular and genetic diversity of T. evansi was analyzed using the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene. Phylogenetic and haplotype analysis revealed two distinct clusters of T. evansi circulating in India. The genetic diversity indices, neutrality tests, gene flow, and genetic differentiation outcomes confirmed the genetic diversity of the T. evansi population, with a lack of uniformity. The identification of two distinct clusters, exhibiting differential demographic histories and evolutionary forces, implies that the clusters may have undergone independent evolutionary trajectories or experienced different environmental pressures. Conclusion: The present findings underlined the need of an early and precise diagnosis in order to treat and control T. evansi infections, and the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene is an important genetic marker for understanding the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of T. evansi. This knowledge can be used to create tailored strategies to control and manage the infection in an endemic region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cervical spinal nerve insult can be a sequel of osteoarthropathy in horses due to enlargement of the articular processes (AP). Objectives: To describe the percutaneous endoscopic cervical foraminotomy procedure in horses. Study design: Ex vivo experimental study and clinical case report. Methods: The technique was performed in three equine cadavers and in two clinical cases with history of forelimb lameness located in the caudal cervical region. Briefly, the horse was positioned in lateral recumbency, with the affected AP joint uppermost. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the endoscopic instruments (Ø 6.9 mm, length 207 mm, 25° angle of vision) were positioned at the dorsal bony margin of the intervertebral foramen (IVF). The bone was freed from soft tissues and removed using diamond various burrs, hence widening the IVF. The bone drilling was continued until the medial cortical surface of the caudal AP was removed. Thereafter, the endoscope was removed and the skin portal was closed. Results: The average of operation time in clinical cases was 98 ± 24 min. The horses recovered smoothly from the operation. At 12-month follow-up, the clinical signs had resolved completely without recurrence. Main limitation: Small number of clinical cases and absence of post-mortem examination or histopathology performed in the cadaver study to assess possible iatrogenic injuries. Conclusion: Cervical spinal nerve decompression via minimal invasive foraminotomy is feasible in horses. More research is required before this procedure can be recommended in clinical cases. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The burgeoning population of feral horses in the American west is due to high population growth, resulting from low adult mortality and high foal survival. In two populations of feral horses in western Utah, USA only 15 foals died (5%; mean age <1 month) over a 4-year period. Seven additional foals (age <70 days) were observed separated from their dam, with no return to suckling or associating with the dam (i.e., abandoned). Factors affecting fate of foals were examined by comparing dead and separated foals with siblings (n = 19 dams, n = 32 siblings). Foals becoming separated or dying were observed in all years of the study, were unrelated to horse density, environmental effects, or gather events. There was no effect of dam body condition, parity, or age on foal survival or separation, and no effect of length of time the dam was in a group, whether the foal was born into the same group as conceived, and number of group changes made by the dam while pregnant. Dams of foals that died or were separated were more likely to change groups within 2 months after the foal was first seen, mostly after foal death or separation. Separated foals were near their dam less often, but there was no difference in frequency of social interactions. Separation of foals and dams is a natural occurrence in feral horses and survival likelihood for these foals is high – all separated foals that remained on the range in this study survived. © 2023 Sarah R.B.

ABSTRACT: Acute abdominal pain (colic) is one of the major equine health threats worldwide and often necessitates intensive veterinary medical care and surgical intervention. Equine coronavirus (ECoV) infections can cause colic in horses but are rarely considered as a differential diagnosis. To determine the frequency of otherwise undetected ECoV infections in horses with acute colic, fresh fecal samples of 105 horses with acute colic and 36 healthy control horses were screened for viruses belonging to the Betacoronavirus 1 species by RT-PCR as well as for gastrointestinal helminths and bacteria commonly associated with colic. Horses with colic excreted significantly fewer strongyle eggs than horses without colic. The prevalence of anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium perfringens and Clostridioides difficile) was significantly higher in the feces of horses with colic. Six horses with colic (5.7%) and one horse from the control group (2.8%) tested positive for Betacoronaviruses. Coronavirus-positive samples were sequenced to classify the virus by molecular phylogeny (N gene). Interestingly, in three out of six coronavirus-positive horses with colic, sequences closely related to bovine coronaviruses (BCoV) were found. The pathogenic potential of BCoV in horses remains unclear and warrants further investigation. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Sustainability is the balancing act of optimizing the use of current resources without compromising the current or future environment. Within the agriculture sector the primary focus of sustainability has been to reduce environmental pollution, specifically greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions, nitrogen emissions, and leaching. For the equine industry the first step towards sustainability is the documentation and critique of current feeding and management practices to permit modifications to enable the industry meet social and legislative obligations. As a monogastric hindgut fermenter on a per kg bodyweight basis the horse has relatively lower GHG emissions compared to ruminants. However, there are several opportunities to further reduce the environmental impact of the equine industry. The majority of these relate to subtle changes, or consideration of, improving feed conversion, using alternative ingredients, and management of fecal material associated with intensive husbandry. To initiate the journey towards sustainability this review documents opportunities with current equine feeding and management practices to reduce the environmental impacts of the equine industry. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Argentina is one of the countries that exports animals for equestrian sports. This paper analyzes the environmental effects of sport horse production farms in Argentina and proposes actions to minimize the environmental effects of this type of production. Twenty-six sport horse production farms in the province of Buenos Aires were studied. The proximity of the farms to a surface water body, the destination of the stall bedding, management practices and whether they receive veterinary advice were the characteristics analyzed in relation to feed, its composition and water consumption according to the performance of the animals. A nominal qualitative analysis on the impact was carried out considering three impact categories: low, medium and high. The association between the four environmental variables analyzed has shown that only two farms have a low environmental impact, while eighteen farms have a medium impact and five farms have a high impact. The results show that the role of the professional veterinarian is key in minimizing environmental impact and that the management of excretions and stall bedding should be reviewed in order to reduce the impact. This paper presents recommendations associated with water use, feed and manure management. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Horses with enterolithiasis may develop clinical signs of colic due to partial or complete obstruction of the right dorsal, transverse or small colon. Laparotomy followed by enterotomy at the site of obstruction or mobilisation of enteroliths to intestinal segments deemed more appropriate for incision is indicated in these cases. However, surgical removal of enteroliths lodged in nonexteriorisable intestinal segments and/or not amenable to mobilisation may be labour intensive and dangerous. Pneumatic impact (or ballistic) lithotripsy is a potential tool for surgical resolution of simple and complex cases of enterolithiasis in horses. This study describes the use of a pneumatic lithotripsy device for intraluminal enterolith fragmentation in five cases of enterolithiasis. Seven calculi were successfully fragmented. In four cases, fragmentation was achieved at the site of obstruction and fragments exteriorised through an enterotomy incision created for device introduction or advanced towards the rectum and removed. In two cases, enteroliths were manipulated back to the pelvic flexure, fragmented and removed. Findings of this study suggest that intraluminal enterolith fragmentation can be used to avoid long enterotomy incisions and facilitate removal of calculi lodged in bowel segments that cannot be exteriorised. However, it is important to be aware of the risks of enterolith fragmentation in nonexternalisable bowel segments that cannot be visualised for intestinal viability assessment. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Abortions in horses represent an important health and economic challenge for equine industry. Primary causes of abortion are divided in non-infectious and infectious. Non-infectious causes include abnormalities of foetal appendices (umbilical cord and placenta essentially), abnormalities of gestation, maternal and foetal origins. Infectious abortions are caused in almost cases by bacterial infections, followed by viruses, fungi and parasites. New abortive pathogens (as Leptospira, Neospora caninum, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila abortus, and) have been confirmed in equines by comparison already known for their abortive properties in human or in other species. Despite an increasing number of autopsies and continuous improvements in diagnostic tools, in management and surveillance, 20%–40% of the causes of equine abortion remain unknown depending on the country. To increase the likelihood of a definitive diagnosis in cases of abortion and stillbirth in horses, new diagnostic approaches are needed. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Over the past three decades, equine strongylid egg reappearance periods (ERPs) have shortened substantially for macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics. The ERPs of ivermectin and moxidectin were originally reported in the 8–10 and 12–16 week ranges, respectively, but several recent studies have found them to be around 4–5 weeks for both actives. This loss of several weeks of suppressed strongylid egg output could have substantial implications for parasite control. This study made use of a computer simulation model to evaluate the impact of shortened ERPs on the anthelmintic performance of ivermectin and moxidectin against equine cyathostomins. The original ERPs were set to 7.1 and 15.4 weeks for ivermectin and moxidectin, respectively, while the reduced ERP was set to 4.6 weeks for both actives. Simulations were set to compare model outputs between original and reduced ERP scenarios and results expressed as percent increase in strongylid egg output, infective third stage larvae on herbage (L3h), and encysted early third stage larvae (EL3). For each drug, simulations were evaluated for two different treatment scenarios (2 and 4 treatments annually), two different age groups (yearlings and adults), and for four different climates (cold humid continental, temperate oceanic, humid subtropical, and hot/cold semi-arid). Across all simulations, there was a substantial increase of the three evaluated parameters. With the ivermectin simulations, all three parameters increased in the 100–300% range across climates, age groups and treatment intensities. The moxidectin simulations displayed a wider range of results with parameters increasing from a few hundred to several thousand percent. The increases were most pronounced for L3h in the two cooler climates, reaching as high as 6727%. Overall, the loss of anthelmintic performance was at a magnitude of 10 times larger for moxidectin compared to ivermectin. This performance loss was climate dependent, and was also affected by treatment intensity, but not by horse age. This is the first study to evaluate consequences of shortened ERPs in horses and demonstrated a substantial loss in anthelmintic performance resulting from this development. The results illustrate that anthelmintic efficacy is more than the percent reduction of fecal egg counts at 14 days post treatment, and that substantial anthelmintic performance can be lost despite FECRTs remaining at 100%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Equine atypical myopathy is caused by hypoglycin A (HGA) and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPrG), the known protoxins of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). Various tissues from five atypical myopathy cases were analyzed but only HGA was found. Whether deamination of MCPrG has already occurred in the intestine as the first stage of metabolization has not been investigated. Activation of the protoxins to methylenecyclopropylacetyl (MCPA)-CoA and methylenecyclopropylformyl (MCPF)-CoA, respectively, occurred mainly in the skeletal muscles, as evidenced by very high concentrations of MCPA-carnitine and MCPF-carnitine in this tissue. Inhibition of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases of short- and medium-chain as well as branched-chain fatty acids by the toxins led to a strong increase in the corresponding acylcarnitines, again preferentially in skeletal muscles. An accumulation of the long-chain acylcarnitines beyond the level of the control samples could not be detected in the tissues. As a high amount of HGA was always found unmetabolized in the organs, we speculate that targeting the interruption of further metabolization might be a way to stop the progression of intoxication. Inhibition of the mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, i.e., the first enzyme responsible for the activation of sycamore maple protoxins, could be a therapeutic approach. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Microminerals are necessary for all bodily functions. In animal species, selenium (Se), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) all form part of antioxidant enzymes. Micromineral deficiencies, particularly Se, are well recognized in large animal species in Chile. Glutathion peroxidase (GPx) is a widely used biomarker for Se nutritional status and to diagnose Se deficiency in horses. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a Cu and Zn-dependant antioxidant enzyme, although it is not commonly used as a proxy for the nutritional status of these minerals. Ceruloplasmin (CP) is used as a biomarker of Cu nutritional status. This study´s objective was to explore correlation between said minerals and biomarkers in adult horses from southern Chile. Se, Cu, Zn, GPx, SOD, and CP were measured in whole blood of a group of 32 adult horses (5–15 years old). Further, a second group of 14 adult horses (5–15 years old) underwent gluteal muscle biopsies to determine Cu, Zn, GPx, and SOD. Correlations were determined by means of Pearson´s r coefficient. Significant correlations were found for blood GPx and Se (r = 0.79), blood GPx and SOD (r = -0.6), muscular GPx and SOD (r = 0.78), and Cu and CP (r = 0.48). These results confirm previously described strong association between blood GPx and Se in horses, validating the former´s use as a diagnostic proxy of Se deficiency in Chilean horses, and suggest significant interactions between GPx and SOD in blood and muscle tissue. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Don breed of horses, which became famous in Russia already in the middle of the 18th century, was obtained by long-term crossing of nomadic horses with cultured oriental breeds. Due to the reduction in the number of Don queens to 200 broodmares, the research of the genetic characteristics of this breed is of particular relevance. The purpose of the research was to study the matrilineal structure of the Don horse breed based on phylogenetic analysis of 530 nucleotide pairs [n.p.] of the hypervariable section of the D-loop of mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] in 26 mares representing the main female families. Analysis of the mtDNA sequence was performed using the Neighbor-Joining [NJ] method in combination with bootstrap analysis in the MEGA7 software. In the mitochondrial genomes of the tested Don horses, 26 different haplotypes were identified, which are part of 10 mtDNA haplogroups, including A, B, D, G, L, M, N, O, P, and Q, according to the modern classification. Additionally, four new haplogroups were identified, leading the line from Black Sea mares and atypical for most European breeds. The sequenced fragment of the D-loop from 15471 to 16000 n.p. included 115 polymorphic sites, mainly represented by transversions. The mtDNA structure of the Don breed was dominated by haplogroups G (19.2%), B (15.4%), and L (11.5%). All the analyzed uterine families were clearly differentiated at the level of haplogroups and haplotypes with a high bootstrap support rate (58%–100%). This indicates a high genetic diversity of the genealogical matrilineal structure of the Don horse breed. © 2023, Science and Innovation Center Publishing House. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A 13-year-old Appaloosa gelding was referred for evaluation of a left-sided facial nerve paralysis. On clinical examination, the gelding exhibited muzzle deviation to the right, dropped left ear and blepharospasm of the left eye. A Schirmer tear test revealed 66% reduction in tear production in the left eye and a focal corneal ulcer (0.7 cm by 0.7 cm) was present ventrally in the left eye. Endoscopic examination of the upper airways and guttural pouches showed no abnormalities. Computed tomographic examination revealed an accumulation of soft-tissue attenuating material within the tympanic bulla, consistent with otitis media. Medical management with 30 mg/kg trimethoprim sulfadiazine and 2.2 mg/kg phenylbutazone orally twice a day for 6 weeks was unsuccessful. The non-perforated tympanic bulla was fenestrated from the left guttural pouch using diode LASER transendoscopically, under standing sedation, to allow drainage of the inner ear. Mucopurulent fluid drained from the tympanic bulla cavity. Endoscopic examination 6 months post-surgery showed that the fenestrated site had healed over, with no evidence of inflammation at the site. A very mild muzzle deviation to the right was still present 6 months' post surgery but the horse was able to prehend and masticate without difficulty. The procedure was successful, and the clinical signs improved significantly post-surgery. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Acute phase protein (APP) measurement is used to detect inflammation. Intramuscular (IM) injections could cause tissue injury and induce an acute phase response (APR). Objectives: To evaluate the effects of IM procaine penicillin G (PPG) injections on APP concentrations in horses. Study design: Prospective longitudinal design. Methods: PPG was administered intramuscularly to six horses, twice daily, for 5 days. Plasma fibrinogen (FIB), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (HAP), creatine kinase (CK), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were quantified daily for 5 days before the first injection, during the course of administration, and for 4 days after the final dose. Analytes were quantified every other day for the remaining 16 days. Data were compared using a parametric or non-parametric repeated measures ANOVA and a Tukey's or Mann–Whitney rank sum test, respectively. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: CK was increased over baseline (mean ± SD: 200 ± 74 IU/L) on Days 1–6 (p < 0.001 to p = 0.02, mean ± SD: 723–1177 ± 355–544 IU/L) and AST was increased above baseline (mean ± SD: 233 ± 58 IU/L) on Days 2–7 and 10 (p < 0.001 to p = 0.05, mean ± SD: 307–437 ± 79–146 IU/L). Increased FIB was noted over baseline (mean ± SD: 177 ± 30 mg/dl) on Days 6–8 and 10 (p = 0.02 to p = 0.03, mean ± SD: 234–252 ± 33–49 mg/dl). SAA was increased above baseline (mean ± SD: 4.7 ± 2.9) on Day 6 (p = 0.02, mean ± SD: 113 ± 186 μg/ml). There was no change in HAP. Main limitations: Healthy horses were used, small sample size, and a lack of a negative control group.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the current in vivo, observational study was to investigate the effects of different hoof manipulations on landing duration (LandD), location (ICloc) and angle of initial contact (ICangle) in the front feet of horses. A novel, hoof-mounted, inertial measurement unit sensor system (IMU) was used. Ten sound, crossbred horses were fitted with an IMU sensor at the dorsal hoof wall and examined barefoot and after trimming. Additionally, the application of 120 g lateral weights and 5° medial side wedges as well as steel, aluminium, egg bar, and lateral extension shoes were tested. Horses were guided in a straight line on firm ground. The use of steel shoes increased LandD compared to barefoot and enhanced the individual ICloc in trot. Application of rolled toe shoes caused a longer LandD than use of plain shoes. None of the other modifications significantly influenced the timing or spatial variables of hoof landing. Trimming and shoeing have less impact on the landing pattern of horses than assumed in practice. Still, the use of steel shoes changes sliding properties of the hooves on firm ground and increases weight causing a longer LandD and reinforcement of the individual ICloc. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The Buryatian horse is an ancient breed and, as an indigenous breed, they have unique adaptive abilities to use scarce pastures, graze in winter, and survive in harsh conditions with minimal human care. In this study, fecal microbiota of Buryatian horses grazing in the warm and cold seasons were investigated using NGS technology on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We hypothesized that the composition of microbial communities in the feces of horses maintained on pasture would change in the different seasons, depending on the grass availability and different plant diets. We conducted microhistological fecal studies of horse diet composition on steppe pasture. The alpha diversity analysis showed horses had a more abundant and diverse gut microbiota in summer. There were significant effects on the beta diversity of microbial families, which were clustered by the warm and cold season in a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), with 45% of the variation explained by two principal coordinates. This clustering by season was further confirmed by the significant differences observed in the relative abundances of microbial families and genera. The obtained results can serve as an experimental substantiation for further study of the impact of pasture grasses, which have a pharmacological effect, on the diversity of the gut microbiome and horse health. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The feeding planning and formulation of feed ration of the growing horse during the indoor feeding season is always based on good quality forages. It is important to plan the diet's forage-to-concentrate ratio, i.e. to optimize the forage intake from the health and welfare perspective of the horse. During summer, whole-day grazing is generally recommendable to promote the health and welfare of horses, and to support their natural behaviour. To know how the diet can be properly balanced with supplemental feeding, the nutrient content of feeds must be known. Thus, a forage analysis is crucial for the successful use of diets dominated by forage. It is also important that all fibre sources are high in their hygienic quality, influenced mainly by their storing. Also, if horses are fed in groups, their individual needs have to be considered applying individual feeding, especially if the group consists of horses of different sizes and breeds. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of clodronate disodium (CLO) in juvenile sheep and the plasma protein binding (PPB) of CLO in juvenile sheep and horses. ANIMALS 11 juvenile crossbred sheep (252 ± 6 days) for the pharmacokinetic study. Three juvenile crossbred sheep (281 ± 4 days) and 3 juvenile Quarter Horses (599 ± 25 days) for PPB analysis. METHODS CLO concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis from plasma samples obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after CLO administered IM at 0.6 mg/kg. PPB was determined using equine and ovine plasma in a single-use rapid equilibrium dialysis system. RESULTS The mean and range for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax: 5,596; 2,396–8,613 ng/mL), time of maximal concentration (Tmax: 0.5; 0.5–1.0 h), and area under the curve (AUCall: 12,831; 7,590–17,593 h X ng/mL) were similar to those previously reported in horses. PPB in sheep and horses was moderate to high, with unbound fractions of 26.1 ± 5.1% in sheep and 18.7 ± 7.5% in horses, showing less than a 1.4-fold difference. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The pharmacokinetic parameters and PPB of CLO in juvenile sheep were similar to those previously reported in horses. The results suggest that juvenile sheep can be utilized as an animal model for studying the potential risks and/or benefits of bisphosphonate use in juvenile horses. © 2023, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical significance of fecal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Salmonella results when taking the cycle threshold values (Ct) into account. The study included 120 Salmonella qPCR-positive fecal samples obtained from 88 hospitalized horses over a 2-year period. The mean Ct of the qPCR test was evaluated in regard to (1) clinical outcome and (2) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) status (no SIRS, moderate SIRS, or severe SIRS) of the sampled horses. An ROC analysis was performed to establish the optimal cut-off Ct values associated with severe SIRS. The mean ± SD Ct value was significantly lower in samples (1) from horses with a fatal issue (27.87 ± 5.15 cycles) than in surviving horses (31.75 ± 3.60 cycles), and (2) from horses with severe SIRS (27.87 ± 2.78 cycles) than from horses with no (32.51 ± 3.59 cycles) or moderate (31.54 ± 3.02 cycles) SIRS. In the ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off value of Ct associated with a severe SIRS was 30.40 cycles, with an AUC value of 0.84 [95% confidence interval 0.76–0.91] and an OR of 0.64 [0.51–0.79]. Results suggest that including the Ct value in the interpretation of fecal qPCR results could improve the diagnostic value of this test for clinical salmonellosis in horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study was conducted to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the benzimidazole (BZ) resistance in strongyle nematode egg populations in horses using molecular techniques. A total of 200 fecal samples were collected from horses in 26 farms in two provinces (Kayseri and Nevşehir) of the Central Anatolia Region of Türkiye between May and August 2022. The flotation method was used to detect strongyle nematode eggs in the fecal samples of the horses. Afterward, strongyle nematode eggs were collected, and the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) technique was used to detect the BZ resistance. BZ-susceptible and BZ-resistant PCR products were sequenced to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene. The strongyle nematode eggs were determined in 85 (42.5%) out of 200 fecal samples. AS-PCR detected 50.58% (43/85) BZ-resistant (homozygous resistant) and 36.4% (31/85) BZ-susceptible (homozygous susceptible) genes in the strongyle eggs. Both BZ-resistant and BZ-susceptible genes (heterozygous) were determined in 11 samples. BZ-resistant and BZ-susceptible allele frequencies were determined as 57.0% (48.5/85) and 43.0% (36.5/85), respectively. SNPs were detected only in codon 200 of the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene in four sequenced isolates of the two resistant and two susceptible isolates. This study is the first molecular report on BZ resistance in strongyle nematode eggs in horses in Türkiye. The widespread prevalence of BZ-resistant alleles in equine strongyle nematodes shows the requirement for the immediate usage of other anthelmintics instead of the BZ group drugs for the effective management and control of equine strongyle nematodes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Pyelonephritis is a serious condition that is rarely described in horses. In contrast, urinary tract infections are common in humans and small animals, and multi-drug-resistant urinary infections are an emerging threat. In this report, we describe a horse with unilateral pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria belonging to the Enterobacter cloacae complex. [Correction added on 9 August 2023, after first online publication: The preceding sentence was corrected.] An 11-year-old Swedish warmblood gelding was diagnosed with a cystolith and a cystotomy through an open left para-inguinal approach was performed. Seven days after surgery the horse presented with pyrexia, dullness and colic. Diagnostic testing and renal transabdominal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a right-sided pyelonephritis. Culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a pure growth of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing E. cloacae complex bacteria with resistance against beta-lactams, aminoglycoside and trimethoprim–sulphonamide classes. Treatment included prolonged oral antimicrobials according to susceptibility testing results (enrofloxacin), judicious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluid therapy and gastric ulcer prophylaxis. The horse recovered successfully and is currently in good health (follow-up of 5 years). Once the infection resolved, unilateral renal scarring occurred. Multidrug-resistant upper-urinary infections occur in horses and should be considered in a post-surgical patient that develops fever. Early diagnosis, urine bacterial culturing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were crucial in this case to successful management. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: African horse sickness (AHS) has become a newly emerging disease after an outbreak in northeastern Thailand in March 2020. Mass vaccination in horses with live-attenuated AHS virus (AHSV) vaccine is essential for AHS control and prevention. This study aimed to monitor the longitudinal humoral immune response before and after a single vaccination using a live-attenuated vaccine against AHS in stallions, mares, and pregnant mares, including maternal immunity in foals born from pregnant mares during the outbreak in Thailand. Materials and Methods: A total of 13 stallions and 23 non-pregnant and 21 pregnant mares were vaccinated with live-attenuated AHSV vaccines. Serum samples from selected horses were collected on the day of vaccination and 1, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12-months post-vaccination. Furthermore, seven serum samples of foals born from vaccinated pregnant mares were collected on parturition date and 1, 3, and 6-months old. The antibody titer against AHS in all collected serum samples was evaluated using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. All data were analyzed for mean and standard deviation for each group of samples using a spreadsheet program. Antibody titers between times were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance as repeated measurement, and antibody titers between horse groups were analyzed using a general linear model for statistically significant differences when p < 0.05. Results: In stallion and non-pregnant mare groups, there were no statistically significant differences in antibody titers in all 6 time periods after vaccination. The antibody titer in the pregnant mare group showed a non-statistically significant difference between each gestation stage, except at 8 months post-vaccination. Furthermore, increasing antibody titers on days 1 and 3 after receiving colostrum in foals indicate the major role of transcolostral antibody transfer for AHS. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a single AHS vaccination using a live-attenuated vaccine could stimulate high antibody titers sufficient for AHS control and prevention during the outbreak in Thailand. Similarly, the antibody response of vaccinated horses of both genders, including various stages of pregnant mares, was statistically not different. © Kunanusont, et al.

ABSTRACT: Superficial digital flexor tendinitis (SDFT) and proximal suspensory desmitis (PSD) are common causes of lameness in horses. Current treatment options include rest, controlled exercise, administration of anti-inflammatories, intralesional injections, surgery, and electrohydraulic shock wave therapy (ESWT). ESWT is safe, noninvasive, and is used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal abnormalities. Medical records between 2010 and 2021 were reviewed. Horses were separated into two categories: (group 1: ≥ 3 ESWT treatments; group 2: < 3 ESWT treatments). Our objective was to examine the effect of the number of ESWT treatments in the management of SDFT and PSD injuries and to compare short- and long-term outcomes for the two groups. For group 1, lameness scores between the first and third treatments were significantly reduced in both PSD (P < .0001) and SDFT (P = .016) horses. However, neither the PSD (P = .062) nor SDFT's (P = .125) ultrasound findings were significantly different at the end of the third treatment. Horses with PSD showed a significant improvement in forelimb lameness between the first and third treatments compared to hindlimb (P = .033). In the multivariable ordered logistic regression model, only time (months of follow-up) was significantly associated with a positive outcome (P = .001) and there was no difference in short and long-term outcome between groups 1 and 2. Also, chronicity of injury was negatively associated with improvement of lameness (P = .028). © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of lameness in sport horses with a significant economic impact. The prevention of OA is crucial since no effective treatment is available. This study aimed to apply untargeted metabolomic analysis to investigate the differences in synovial fluid (SF) composition between healthy and OA-affected joints in horses. SF collected from healthy (n.8) and OA (n.11) horses was analyzed using H-NMR analysis. Metabolomic analysis allowed 55 different metabolites to be identified and quantified in SF samples. Nineteen metabolites were found to be differently concentrated in OA compared to control horses. Synovial fluids from the OC group were found to be higher in 1,3-dihydroxyacetone but lower in tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, uridine, creatinine, creatine, glycine, choline, asparagine, glutamine, arginine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, valine, 2-hydroxyisovalerate, α-ketoisovaleric acid, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, isoleucine, and methionine compared to the controls. A variety of SF metabolites significantly changed following joint disease, demonstrating the complex mechanism underlying osteoarthritis in horses and highlighting the value of applying the metabolomic approach in clinical research. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Context. Genomic tools allow for increased efficiency in animal production and, consequently, greater production gains. Morphometric measurements of height can be used for breed characterisation/registration, and sex distinction, in addition to being associated with balance, posture, and the range of motion of the limbs, influencing the dynamics and quality of the gait. Aims. This study was conducted to examine candidate genes related to the morphometric measurement of heights in Campolina horses. Methods. The study involved information from 18 876 horses of this breed, containing phenotypic data of the measurements of withers, croup, back, and barrel heights, provided by the Brazilian Association of Campolina Horse Breeders (ABCCCampolina). Of these, 48 horses of the Brazilian Campolina breed were genotyped with the Equine 65 K lllumina® chip. The effects of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms were estimated by the weighted single-step method, using BLUPF90 family programs. Genes in the main chromosomal regions were identified by consultation with the NCBI. Key results. A genomic-wide association study for withers height showed that 46% of the variation in this measurement was explained by 20 genomic windows. For croup height, 19 genomic windows were responsible for explaining 44% of the variation. Sixteen genomic windows were responsible for explaining 37.8% of the variation in back height and 18 genomic regions explained 39.7% of the variation in barrel height. Conclusion. The ADAM17, SOX11, and KLF11 genes are located in the genomic windows that most explain the variations in the traits under study and have a biological action on the locomotor system. Implications. The ADAM17, SOX11, and KLF11 genes are candidates for fine mapping and construction of molecular markers. © 2023 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cardiac arrhythmias have not been previously reported in horses while swimming. Objectives: To describe the type and frequency of encountered arrhythmias during repetitive swimming cycles. Study design: Descriptive observational study. Methods: Sixteen horses swam five pool lengths (75 m), each separated by an active recovery walk. Continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded (n = 80) and analysed during the pre-swim, swim and active-recovery periods. Arrhythmias were categorised as sinus arrhythmia (SA), sinus block, sinus pause (compensatory and non-compensatory), second degree atrioventricular block (2AVB) for physiological arrhythmias, supraventricular premature depolarisation (SVPD) and ventricular premature depolarisation (VPD) for non-physiological arrhythmias. A linear mixed-effects model was used to examine the effects of repetitive swim lengths on arrhythmias and swimming parameters. Data were reported as median [interquartile range]. Results: Fifteen horses (94%) experienced at least one arrhythmia; however, the frequency remained low and 2AVB were only observed during the pre-swim period. The swimming heart rate (HR) was 162 bpm [141;173]. Sinus blocks, sinus pauses, SA, SVPD and VPD were all recorded at least once during swimming. Except for one VPD couplet, all premature depolarisations were isolated. During active-recovery, the HR was 105 bpm [103;106], with SA observed in 13 horses (81%), isolated SVPD in six horses (38%), sinus pause in one horse (6%) but no VPD present. Main limitations: Limited number of horses precluding population prevalence assessment. Conclusion and clinical importance: High-quality underwater ECGs were acquired in swimming horses for the first time. The frequency of arrhythmias remained low and rare pathological arrhythmias were observed during repetitive swimming and active-recovery cycles. Swimming with active-recovery periods is not a high-risk cardio-arrhythmic exercise. © 2022 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Mutations in KIT, a gene that influences melanoblast migration and pigmentation, often result in mammalian white spotting. As of February 2023, over 30 KIT variants associated with white spotting were documented in Equus caballus (horse). Here we report an association of increased white spotting on the skin and coat with a variant in the 5′UTR of KIT (rs1149701677: g.79,618,649A>C). Horses possessing at least one alternate allele demonstrate phenotypic characteristics similar to other KIT mutations: clear borders around unpigmented regions on the body, face, and limbs. Using a quantitative measure of depigmentation, we observed an average white score of 10.70 among individuals with rs1149701677, while the average score of the control, homozygous reference sample was 2.23 (P = 1.892e-11, n = 109, t-test). The rs1149701677 site has a cross-species conservation score of 3.4, one of the highest scores across the KIT 5′UTR, implying regulatory importance for this site. Ensembl also predicted a “moderately impactful” functional effect for the rs1149701677 variant. We propose that this single nucleotide variant likely alters the regulation of KIT, which in turn may disrupt melanoblast migration causing an increase in white spotting on the coat. Alternatively, the rs1149701677 variant may be in linkage with another nearby variant with an as-yet-undiscovered functional impact. We propose to term this new allele “Holiday White” or W35 based on conventional nomenclature. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Work or exercise apparently increases the demand for energy more than for protein. The energy content of diets has traditionally been increased by supplementing rations with grain and other starch-rich concentrates. This leads to large intakes of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) predisposing horses to metabolic and digestive problems. High dietary NSC contents decrease the microbial digestion in the hindgut also in healthy horses and are associated with higher incidence of osteochondrosis and stomach ulcers. To maintain a healthy digestive tract and good welfare of young horses in training, an adequate supply of structural fibre is required when stabled - a minimum level of at least 1.5% of BW as forage feed (DM) is recommended. High calcium intake is beneficial to bone mineral content especially at the beginning of their breaking and training. However, mineral intake alone does not increase the bone density, but mineralization happens only when young horses are exercised regularly. Supplementation needs of fat-soluble vitamins are needed depending mainly on the diet composition and forage quality. Regarding B-complex vitamins, stress conditions at the onset of training may reduce their adequate synthesis under the needs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: Equine sarcoids (ES) are known globally as the most frequent skin tumour affecting horses. These tumours affect the horse's monetary value, they can affect the horse's welfare and can be difficult and expensive to treat. Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is considered to be the aetiological agent of this tumour, as BPV 1, 2 and 13 have been detected in ES. This is the only known natural cross species infection by a papillomavirus. The BPV genome can be divided into two coding regions: The early region E which encodes the transforming proteins E5, E6 and E7 as well as the replication and transcription regulatory proteins E1 and E2 and the late region encoding the structural proteins of the virus L1 and L2. The E5 oncoprotein is believed to downregulate MHC 1 and as a result, escapes an immune reaction with affecting the cells cycle and eventually allows the viral affected cells to proliferate into ES. We have constructed an ELISA test by utilising the C terminal peptide of the E5 oncoprotein and explored the possibility of IgG antibodies existence in horses to the E5 oncoprotein. For this study we have examined 136 horses, some showing ES lesions (80 horses) and some without ES lesions (56 horses). By using our ELISA test, we have shown that antibodies to the E5 oncoprotein are in fact present and that from a certain level seem to be found only in ES positive horses. Therefore, proving that an immune response to this protein can be expected. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Accurate estimation of body weight (BW) and condition (BCS) is important in the equine practice. The main goal of this research was to develop models for the prediction of BW and BCS of horses in the practice using both common morphometric measurements and measurements of Cresty Neck Score (CNS) and Muscle Atrophy Scoring System (MASS) as a measure of muscularity. Our model showed that the BW of horses could be predicted with high reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.97), accuracy (0.99), and precision (0.97) using the morphometric measurements of the height at withers, circumference of the chest, cane circumference, body length, and body circumference as well as the BCS, CNS, and muscle atrophy score of the hindlimbs. The stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the BCS of horses can be predicted with the data of parameters such as age, body length and an index consisting of measurements of the body circumference to height of withers, and the atrophy of the neck. Future research should use larger cohorts of animals to validate the findings of this study. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Nulliparity is associated with intra-uterine growth retardation and foal delayed catch-up growth. Older mares produce larger/taller foals than the precedents. Nursing at conception on foal growth had not been investigated yet. In any case, milk production conditions the foal's growth. This study aimed to determine effects of mare parity, age and nursing on subsequent lactation quantity and quality. Saddlebred mares and their foals (N = 43) run as a single herd over the same year were: young (6-7-year-old) primiparous, young multiparous, old (10-16-year-old) multiparous nursing at insemination time or old multiparous barren the previous year. No young nursing nor old multiparous mares were available. Colostrum was collected. Milk production and foal weight were monitored at 3-, 30-, 60-, 90- and 180-days postfoaling. The foal average daily weight gain (ADG) was calculated for each period between two measurements. Milk fatty acid (FA), sodium, potassium, total protein and lactose contents were determined. The primiparous versus multiparous colostrum was richer in immunoglobulin G, with lower production but greater FA contents in milk. The primiparous foals had a lower ADG for 3 to 30 days postpartum period. Old mares’ colostrum contained more SFA and less polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) whereas their milk was richer in proteins and sodium and poorer in short-chain-SFA with a reduced PUFA/SFA ratio at 90 days. Nursing mares’ colostrum was richer in MUFA and PUFA and late-lactation milk production was reduced. In conclusion, parity, age and nursing at conception affect mare's colostrum and milk production and foal growth and should be considered for broodmares' management. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: A 16-year-old, 550 kg Connemara gelding was anaesthetised for resection of multiple small intestine strangulating lipomas via ventral midline celiotomy. Severe hypoxaemia, detected throughout the anaesthetic period (lowest PaO2 58 mmHg [7.6 kPa]), was unresponsive to the ventilatory strategies implemented. Flared nostrils and increased respiratory rate were present at recovery from anaesthesia. When the horse was returned to the yard, bilateral foamy nasal discharge and increased respiratory effort and rate were noticed, consistent with pulmonary oedema. The horse received oxygen supplementation and furosemide, which led to complete resolution within 24 hours. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In the sport of dressage, one or more judges score the combined performance of a horse and rider with an emphasis on the technical correctness of the movements performed. At the end of the test, a single score is awarded for the ‘general impression’, which considers the overall performance of the horse and rider as a team. This study explored original measures that contributed to the general impression score in a group of 20 horse–rider combinations. Horses and riders were equipped with inertial measurement units (200 Hz) to represent the angular motion of a horse’s back and the motions of a rider’s pelvis and trunk. Each combination performed a standard dressage test that was recorded to video. Sections of the video were identified for straight-line movements. The videos were analyzed by two or three judges. Four components were scored separately: gaits of the horse, rider posture, effectiveness of aids, and harmony with the horse. The main contributor to the score for gaits was stride frequency (R = −0.252, p = 0.015), with a slower frequency being preferred. Higher rider component scores were associated with more symmetrical transverse-plane trunk motion, indicating that this original measure is the most useful predictor of rider performance. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to investigate the effects of storing horse semen either in a dry shipper (≤ −150 °C) or on dry ice (≤ −78 °C) for up to 14 days. A total of 264 frozen semen straws from male horses (n = 8) stored in liquid nitrogen were transferred on day 0 (d0) to a dry shipper or a dry ice styrofoam box. On d1, d3, d7, d10, and d14, straws from the dry shipper and dry ice were returned to the liquid nitrogen container. Semen was evaluated by CASA for total (TMot), progressive motility (PMot) and sperm velocity parameters, by fluorescence microscopy for percentage of membrane-intact sperm (SYBR14/PI), high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP; JC1) and DNA fragmentation. Temperature inside the containers was monitored continuously. Until d7, no changes were observed in TMot, PMot, and membrane-intact spermatozoa. Thereafter, all three parameters decreased in semen stored on dry ice but not in a dry shipper (time p < 0.001, time x shipping device p < 0.001). The HMMP decreased continuously over time in both containers with a more pronounced decrease on dry ice compared to the dry shipper (shipping device p < 0.01, time p < 0.001, time x device p < 0.001). The DNA fragmentation increased on d10–14 on dry ice and d14 in the dry shipper (time p < 0.001, time x device p < 0.01). In conclusion, frozen horse semen can be safely stored for up to 7 days on dry ice. Sperm DNA integrity and HMMP, however, were adversely affected after 14 days in both shipping devices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute phase protein in horses which could be a useful tool for assessing clinical response to treatment of bacterial pneumonia in adult horses. Objectives: To monitor SAA concentration in response to treatment and identify associations among SAA concentration, WBC and neutrophil counts, and fibrinogen in bacterial pneumonia in adult horses. Animals: Eighteen adult horses with bacterial pneumonia. Methods: Prospective clinical study. Horses hospitalized with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled and SAA concentration and vital signs were assessed daily. SAA concentration was measured by a handheld meter. CBC and plasma fibrinogen were assessed on days 0, 1, and 2, then every 3 days until discharge. Data were not normally distributed and therefore were log transformed. Log-transformed data were analyzed and comparisons were performed on LSMeans by the 2-sided Student's t-test at the 5% level of significance. Results: Geometric mean SAA concentration on day 0 was 537 μg/mL (SE 383 μg/mL). Geometric mean SAA concentration decreased significantly over time (P =.0001), peaking at day 2 (geomean 1038 μg/mL, SE 261.7 μg/mL) and decreasing until discharge. Plasma concentration of fibrinogen (P =.06), neutrophil count (P =.48), and WBC count (P =.07) did not change significantly over time. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: SAA concentration decreased significantly over the course of treatment and correlated with clinical improvement of pneumonia whereas fibrinogen, neutrophil, and WBC counts did not. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, health issues related to exercise and parasite control in growing horses are discussed. Concerning problems associated with bone health, the importance of exercise is highlighted, and many of the problems can be avoided by providing a balanced diet and ensuring that the skeletal system is trained properly. Proper nutrition is vital for a healthy skeleton only if the sufficient and right type of exercise is accompanying it. The best opportunity to make the skeleton strong is to provide it with proper stimuli through exercise when a horse is young and growing. Due to their high susceptibility to parasitic disease, anthelmintic treatment in growing horses is advisable without prior diagnostics. For example, any move to a new group, e.g. after weaning, should be performed only after anthelmintic treatment. In foals and young horses, in addition to strategic anthelmintic treatment, management practices aiming to reduce parasite burdens on pastures are especially prudent. Faecal removal twice weekly has been shown to be more effective than anthelmintic treatment. It is advisable to practice faecal removal from any paddocks in use, as long as temperatures are above freezing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: The available science often demonstrates the need for feral horse population control but not the degree of control required to achieve environmental conservation objectives. To better manage the influence of feral horses, we must first understand the relationship between feral horse density and environmental impact. We recorded vegetation and soil disturbance, and the sign of potential causes of this impact in two parts of the Australian Alps, the Bogong high plains (BHP) and the Eastern Victorian Alps (EVA). We calculated density-impact functions to assist managers with determining feral horse density targets for control programmes. Minimal sign of feral horse impact was detected on the BHP, with no impact of feral horses observed along 99% of the length of transects. In contrast, impacts assigned to feral horses were significantly higher in the EVA, where a larger, higher-density population of feral horses existed. However, greater than 83% of the walked transect length was still undisturbed by feral horses in the EVA. We detected a threshold of horse impact at ~ 250 horse faecal piles per ha. Above this threshold, a slight increase in horse density resulted in a disproportionately large increase in impact. In this context, a relatively small population control effort may substantially reduce direct horse impact. But where horse densities exist below this threshold, considerably more expense and control effort (resulting from the difficulties related to control at low density) is likely to make very little difference to an already low level of direct impact. The combined impacts associated with the sign of deer, feral pigs, fire and humans were large compared to that of feral horses. Management of feral horses to reduce their direct impact is unlikely to be beneficial without complementary management to reduce the effects of these other agents of impact. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes through qualitative and quantitative analysis of European Union (EU) policy documents the framing of EU policy on energy-efficient buildings from the 1970s to 2022. We find that it has been framed in different ways over the decades and the framing has expanded to include more and more benefits. Through this expansion, energy efficiency has been linked to other policy areas, such as security, environmental, economic, and social policy. The shifts in framing can be seen as responses to external events. The expansion can also be explained using two metaphors to analyze how the framing differs depending on political positioning. One where policy is seen as a Swiss knife, able to solve multiple political problems, and one where policy is seen as a Trojan horse, where new policy domains are snuck in by policymakers disguising it as energy efficiency policy to increase EU competency in relation to national governments. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Determination of digestibility represents the first step for the evaluation of the net energy content of feed for livestock animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo digestibility and in vitro degradability of five diets characterized by different forage/concentrate ratios (F:C) in horses. The in vitro degradability was determined by the Gas Production Technique (GPT), using as an inoculum source the feces of the same subjects used for the in vivo test. Five diets consisting of poliphyte hay, straw and grains of barley and oats with a different F:C ratio [90/10 (Diet 1); 78/22 (Diet 2); 68/32 (Diet 3); 60/40 (Diet 4); 50/50 (Diet 5) were formulated and administered in succession, starting with Diet 1. In the in vivo results, no significant differences emerged, despite the different F:C content. In in vitro fermentation, four diets out of the five (2, 3, 4, 5) presented a similar trend of the curve of gas production, showing good activity of the fecal micro population during the first hours of incubation. An important correlation between gas and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) were found, suggesting that the processes linked to the micro population deriving from the horse’s caecum follow metabolic pathways whose products can be modeled in the same way as for the rumen. The GPT could represent the correct method for studying the nutritional characteristics of feed for horses, using feces as the source of inoculum, even if further investigations must be performed to improve the technique. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: A disturbing number of ridden horses are lame, although assumed by riders to be pain free. A Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was developed; an RHpE score of ≥8/24 is likely to indicate the presence of musculoskeletal pain. Pain assessment in Icelandic horses is challenging; the RHpE may facilitate lameness recognition. Objectives: To determine the repeatability of application of an adapted RHpE to Icelandic horses by a single observer. To evaluate the relationship between RHpE scores and lameness or abnormalities of canter. Study design: Prospective, cross-sectional study. Methods: Video-recordings of 30 Icelandic horses performing a standardised test (walk, trot, tölt, canter) were acquired. The adapted RHpE, to include tölt, was applied to all recordings twice in random order by a single observer. Agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa. The presence of lameness, abnormalities of canter and lameness grade was determined by an independent expert. The association between maximum lameness grade and RHpE score was tested using Spearman's rank correlation. Results: All horses exhibited both lameness, the majority in >1 limb, and abnormalities of canter. The RHpE score was ≥8/24 in 96% (median 10/24 and 10.5/24, respectively, for the two assessments). There was substantial to near-perfect agreement for the majority of behaviours (63.6%) and moderate or fair agreement for 32%. There was no correlation between maximum lameness grades and RHpE scores. Main limitations: The absence of non-lame horses with correct saddle fit for horse and rider. Conclusions: There was good repeatability of application of the RHpE. Musculoskeletal pain was associated with RHpE scores of ≥8/24 in the majority of horses. Data acquired from non-lame horses, ridden in well-fitting tack by riders of appropriate size, are needed to determine if the threshold of step frequency in trot needs to be adjusted for more accurate application of the RHpE in Icelandic horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This article traces the characteristics, origin, distribution, and function of alternative lateral horse gaits, i.e., intermediate speed lateral-sequence gaits. Such alternative lateral gaits (running walk, rack, broken pace, hard pace, and broken trot) are prized by equestrians today for their comfort and have been found in select horse breeds for hundreds of years and even exhibited in fossil equid trackways. After exploring the evolution and development of alternative lateral gaits via fossil equid trackways, human art, and historical writings, the functional and genetic factors that led to the genesis of these gaits are discussed. Such gaited breeds were particularly favored and spread by the Scythians, Celts, Turks, and Spaniards. Fast and low-swinging hard pacing gaits are common in several horse breeds of mountainous areas of East and North Asia; high-stepping rack and running walk gaits are often displayed in European and North and South American breeds; the broken pace is found in breeds of Central Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia, Western North America, and Brazil in South America; and the broken trot occurs in breeds of North Asia, South Asia, the Southern United States, and Brazil in South America, inhabiting desert or marshy areas. © 2023 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Horses commonly receive hyoscine butylbromide (HB) prior to hospital admission for colic. This could alter the appearance of the small intestine (SI) on ultrasound scan and affect clinical decision making. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of HB on ultrasonographically assessed SI motility and heart rate. Six horses hospitalised for medical colic with no significant abnormalities on baseline abdominal ultrasound examination were included. Ultrasound was performed in three locations (right inguinal, left inguinal and hepatoduodenal window) before and at 1, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg HB. Three blinded reviewers assessed SI motility using a subjective grading scale from 1 to 4, one being normal motility and four being no motility. Moderate interindividual and interobserver variability was observed, but none of the included horses developed dilated turgid loops of SI. Hyoscine butylbromide did not significantly reduce SI motility grade in any location (P = .60 left inguinal, P = .16 right inguinal, P = .09 duodenum). Heart rate (mean ± SD) was 33 ± 3 prior to HB injection and peaked at 71.3 ± 9 one-minute postinjection. Heart rate was significantly increased until 45 minutes (48 ± 9) after HB administration (P = .04). The appearance of dilated turgid SI loops common with strangulating intestinal lesions did not appear to develop following HB administration. Hyoscine butylbromide administered shortly before abdominal ultrasound examination would not be expected to affect clinical decision making in horses without small intestinal disease. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The growth and development are influenced by heredity, gender, nutrition, and exercise. The growth rate of a foal is related to age and delays smoothly when the foals become older. Nutrition plays a major role among the environmental factors that influence growth and development. Foals that grow very fast are at increased risk of developmental orthopedic disease (DOD). Moderate growth rates may be preferred to minimize bone abnormalities in young horses. In addition, regular and plenty of exercise promote healthy growth and bone formation of young horses. The increase in total intestinal length is the greatest during the most rapid growth period of the foal, weeks 1 to 4. A relatively large decrease in small intestinal length and great increase in the large intestine happen between 1 and 6 months of age when consumption of forage is increasing. The capacity of digesting structural carbohydrates through the suckling period is increasing and is fully competent around the time of weaning. The foal can degrade carbohydrates equivalent to that measured in adults from 1 month of age, and the nutrient digestibility values of younger horses are very similar to those observed in mature horses. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: Delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) via intravascular techniques to treat diffuse and/or inaccessible soft tissue injuries has grown in popularity. The purpose of the current prospective, analytical pilot study was to utilize CT to validate this novel technique and provide additional evidence to support its use for injectate delivery to specific soft tissue structures. Of particular interest was the proximal suspensory ligament, which presents a challenging injection target. Six adult horses without lameness underwent CT of the distal hindlimbs. Scans were obtained prior to ultrasound-guided catheterization of the cranial tibial artery, in addition to early and delayed scans acquired following intra-arterial contrast administration. Region of interest analysis of the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons and suspensory ligament was used to assess contrast enhancement within these structures. Linear mixed models were used to determine statistical significance. Significant (P < 0.05) mean contrast enhancement was seen in all postinjection time points in all soft tissue structures of interest. This indicates that ultrasound-guided injection of the cranial tibial artery results in perfusion of injectate throughout the distal hind limb, including the major soft tissue structures of the metatarsus. This provides further support for this technique as a method of MSC delivery to multifocal or inaccessible injury of these structures, including the proximal suspensory ligament. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Good horse performance depends on a genetic predisposition, training, health status, and optimal values of hematological and biochemical blood parameters. This research aimed to monitor 20 hematological and 15 biochemical blood parameters during different types of physical activity in clinically healthy 20 sports and 20 working horses with an average age of 8.33 years. Sport male horses had higher MCV, MCH, number, and percentage of neutrophils, eosinophils, creatinine, and bilirubin, while mares had higher values of RDW, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, MPV, glucose, BUN-to-creatinine ratio. Physical activity in draft horses led to a statistically significant increase in the number of leukocytes and neutrophils and significant hypocalcemia, while in sport horses, there was a significant increase in RBC, HCT, and HGB and significant hypoglycemia after rest. Significantly higher values of neutrophils and creatinine were recorded in male draft horses, while in mares, there were higher values of lymphocytes and amylase. This study proved that sport horses have better aerobic capacity and performance, are better adapted to the type and intensity of physical activity, and are kept in better conditions than draft horses. The different types of physical activity and other physiological factors can significantly change hematological and biochemical parameters in the draft and sports horses. Monitoring of hematological and biochemical blood parameters during different types of exercise is essential to assessing horses' performance, welfare status, and health status. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Calming supplements are common in the equine industry. This study tested the hypothesis that Phytozen EQ, a blend of citrus botanical oils, magnesium, and yeast would reduce startle response as well as reduce behavioral and physiological signs of stress in young (1.5–6 years of age) horses (n = 14) when tied in isolation and when trailered in isolation. During the 59-day trial, horses were assigned to either the control (CON; n = 7) or treatment (PZEN; n = 7) group that received 56 g of Phytozen EQ daily. Horses underwent a 10-minute isolation test on d 30 and a 15 minute individual trailering test on day 52 or 55. For both tests, blood samples were obtained pre, immediately after, and 1-hour post for analysis of plasma cortisol concentrations, which were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. On day 59, horses underwent a startle test, for which time to travel 3 m and total distance traveled were recorded. These data were analyzed using a T-test. During trailering, PZEN horses tended to have lower overall geometric mean (lower, upper 95% confidence interval) cortisol concentrations than CON (81 [67, 98] vs. 61 [48, 78] ng/mL; P =.071). For the startle test, PZEN horses tended to have longer geometric mean times to travel 3 m than CON horses (1.35 [0.39, 4.70] vs. 0.26 [0.07, 0.91 seconds, P = 0.064). Other data points were not different between treatments (P >.1). It is possible that this dietary supplement could have beneficial calming effects on horses undergoing trailering or in novel situations. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Inflammaging or chronic, low-grade inflammation is a phenomenon characterizing age-related pathologies and natural processes in aging tissues. This study aimed to investigate the effect of age on the serum levels of C-reactive protein and protein electrophoretic pattern in horses. Thirty Italian Saddle horses from the same horse training center, were enrolled and divided in three equal groups according to their age: Group A (2-4 years), Group B (7-10 years), Group C (15-20 years). Blood samples were collected from each horse to evaluate hematological parameters and the serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), total proteins, albumin, α1-, α-2, β1-, β2- and γ-globulins. One-way analysis of variance showed an age-related difference in the concentration of CRP, α1- and α2-globulins (P < 0.001) which increased with aging. Albumin and albumin:globulin ratio showed lower values in Groups B and C than Group A (P < 0.001). Age of horses showed a negative correlation with the values of albumin, and a positive correlation with CRP, α1- and α2-globulins concentration. The results of the current study suggest an increased acute phase response in adult and old horses compared to young ones. As α-globulin fractions include many other acute phase proteins (APPs) in addition to CRP, further studies to assess what other APPs could be involved in chronic inflammation or “inflammaging” are recommended in horse in order to improve knowledge on the key inflammatory biomarkers during aging in this species. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid (ACA) is occasionally used prior to episodes of intense training in racehorses suffering from exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Although a previous study indicated that the drug is cleared rapidly in horses, some racetrack practitioners claim that recent adverse analytical findings for ACA in postrace samples were from ACA administrations 5–7 days before the race. The purpose of this study was to re-examine the pharmacokinetics of ACA in horses to address this apparent conundrum. Eight exercise-conditioned thoroughbred horses were administered 5 g of ACA IV, and blood and urine samples were collected at pre-determined time points prior to drug administration and for up to 168 h after dosing. Concentrations of ACA in the serum and urine samples were determined by LC–MS/MS. The pharmacokinetics of ACA in serum were best described by a three-compartment model with a terminal elimination half-life of 24.2 ± 2.9 h. After dosing, ACA was above the lower limit of detection (1 ng/mL for serum and 10 ng/mL for urine) in all serum and urine samples at all time points. In a similar manner, ACA was above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ; 10 ng/mL for serum and 100 ng/mL for urine) in all serum and urine samples collected from all horses from 0.5 to 120 h post dosing. In six of the eight horses, ACA was above the LLOQ 168 h after dosing in serum and urine samples. LC–MS/MS methodology is the industry standard for testing of samples collected from racehorses with the purpose of controlling the use of medications and performance altering substances. The improved sensitivity of the analytical procedure used in the present study allowed the detection of a prolonged terminal elimination phase of ACA in horses that had not previously been described. Currently, most racing jurisdictions have not adopted a permitted concentration or threshold for ACA in postrace samples, and therefore veterinarians need to allow for an extended withdrawal time of a minimum of 11 days after the administration of ACA to racehorses to substantially reduce the risk of adverse analytical findings of ACA in postrace samples. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Four adult horses with histories of moderate abdominal pain and inappetence were diagnosed with delayed gastric emptying and gastric impaction attributed to pyloroduodenal obstruction (three cases) or duodenitis (one case). A stapled side-to-side gastrojejunostomy was performed on all horses. Two horses returned to work and survived ≥3 years. One horse was euthanased 6 months post-surgery due to recurrent abdominal pain, and one was found dead 5 months postsurgery after an unattended foaling. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Trigeminal nerve-mediated head-shaking (TNMH) in horses is a diagnosis made by exclusion. Computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to identify any disease process that could cause the clinical signs of head-shaking. Although abnormalities are frequently identified, it is unknown whether treatment of these conditions improves clinical signs. Objectives: To ascertain the clinical significance of CT findings in horses presented with a complaint of head-shaking. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: CT and patient records were reviewed and all abnormal findings and any treatments subsequently carried out was recorded. A questionnaire was sent to referring veterinarians and owners were contacted by telephone to establish whether treatment of the identified condition improved clinical signs. Results: This study included 103 horses presented for head CT with the complaint of head-shaking with follow-up information obtained for 84 horses (81.6%). The diagnosis of TNMH was based on a combination of positive maxillary nerve block and/or response to treatment for TNMH. Although TNMH was the most common diagnosis with 62 horses (60.2%) affected, in 22 horses (21.4%), a primary disease process was identified and treatment of the condition eliminated signs of head-shaking. Clinically relevant primary diseases included dental fracture, primary sinusitis, temporo-mandibular joint arthritis, nuchal bursitis, musculoskeletal pathologies, basisphenoid fracture, otitis externa and a mass affecting the infra-orbital nerve. Main limitations: Some clinical information was missing and follow-up information was not obtained in all cases. Conclusions: CT was perceived as a useful diagnostic tool by most veterinarians, ruling out significant abnormalities. In over 20% of the cases, a treatable primary condition was identified leading to complete resolution of clinical signs. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The need for energy is always increasing as civilization evolves. Renewable energy sources are crucial for meeting energy demands as conventional fuel resources are slowly running out. Researchers are working to extract the most amount of power possible from renewable resources. Numerous resources are in demand, including solar, wind, biomass, tidal, and geothermal resources. Solar energy outperformed all the aforementioned resources in terms of efficiency, cleanliness, and pollution freeness. Intermittency, however, is the resource’s main shortcoming. Maximum power point tracking algorithm (MPPT) integration is required for the system to achieve continuous optimum power by overcoming the feature of intermittency. However, generating electrical energy from solar energy has presented a significant problem in ensuring the output power’s quality within a reasonable range. Total harmonic distortion (THD), a phenomenon, may have an impact on the power quality. Depending on the properties of the load, variables like power factor, voltage sag/swell, frequency, and unbalancing may occur. The quality of power and its criterion exhibits a non-linear connection. The article’s primary objective is to analyze the PV interface grid-linked system’s qualitative and quantitative performance. With respect to varying solar irradiation conditions, partial shading conditions, and solar power quality within the acceptable dimension, a novel intelligent multiple-objective horse herd optimization (HHO)-based adaptive fractional order PID (HHO-AFOPID) controller is used to achieve this goal. Adaptive fractional order PID (AFOPID), conventional FOPID, and PID controllers were used to evaluate the performance of the suggested controller, which was then validated using a commercially available PV panel in MATLAB/Simulink by varying the productivity of non-conventional resources, the inverter’s level of uncertainty, and the potential at the grid’s end. In order to realize the features of the system, sensitivity examination is also carried out for solar energy’s sensitive parameters. The stability analysis of the proposed control topology is also carried out in terms of the integral absolute error (IAE) and integral time absolute error (ITAE). The examination of the sensitivity of variations in solar radiation in kilowatt per square meter per day is based on the total net present cost (TNPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE), as optimal dimension and energy cost are both aspects of priority. The suggested control methodology is an approach for the qualitative and quantitative performance analysis of a PV interface grid-oriented system. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In the present review, the authors, based on the multiple functions performed by the liver, analyze the multiple biochemical and hematological changes as an expression of altered liver function in the horse. The liver performs important metabolic functions related to the synthesis, degradation, and excretion of various substances. Modification of these functions can be evaluated and diagnosed by determining serum concentrations of several serum analytes, including enzymes and other endogenous substances. Hepatocellular enzymes, such as sorbitol dehydrogenase-SDH and glutamate dehydrogenase-GLDH, are released following hepatocellular necrosis. Hepatobiliary enzymes, such as γ-glutamyl transferase-GGT, increase in response to necrosis, cholestasis, and other alterations in bile conducts. Serum concentrations of mainly endogenous and exogenous substances that the liver should synthesize or eliminate, such as proteins (albumin and globulins), bile acids, urea, glucose, total and direct bilirubin, and coagulation factors, and fibrinogen should be included in the liver function test profile. The interpretation of laboratory tests of liver function will allow the diagnosis of functional loss of the organ. Some of the analytes considered provide information on the prognosis of liver disease. This review will provide an accurate and objective interpretation of the common biochemical and hematological tests in use in the diagnosis of equine hepatic disease patients, aiding still further the veterinary activity on the applied equine clinical cases. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Trypanosoma evansi, the causative agent of “surra” is enzootic in Iran. The current study aimed to detect T. evansi in horses from different regions of Iran using morphological, serological, and molecular methods. In 2021, 400 blood samples were collected from horses in eight regions. Eighty horses showed clinical signs such as cachexia (n = 64), fever (n = 36), foot edema (n = 40), and abdominal edema (n = 32), and 320 horses appeared healthy. All samples from the studied regions were evaluated for the presence of trypanosomes using direct analysis of blood smears, mercuric chloride, and PCR-based tests. In total, 12% (95% CI: ± 3.1%), 21% (95% CI: ± 3.9%), and 21% (84) of animals were positive for Trypanosoma in microscopic, serologic, and molecular analyses, respectively. All animals positive for SSU rDNA PCR were from Qom, Semnan, and Golestan regions. Further molecular analyses on 84 PCR-positive horses revealed that 29 horses scored positive in PCR using primers of trypanozoon species and 5 scored positive in PCR using primers of Trypanosoma evansi type A. All samples (n = 5) were from Qom region. The 205-bp fragments of T. evansi RoTat 1.2VSG (accession numbers: ON017789-93) analyzed and compared to other isolates sequence from GenBank BLAST search. It has close similarities with isolates from Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia, Kenya, and India. Data herein demonstrated that horses from Iran were at high risk of T. evansi infection. Comprehensive control programs, such as those based on the application of repellants and traps, and also, compliance with quarantine standards are recommended for minimizing the risk of the infection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Orthopaedic infections, including synovial sepsis, osteomyelitis and infection of orthopaedic implants are common in equine medicine. Infections can be caused by haematogenous spread of pathogens, trauma or penetrating injuries, extension of local infections and iatrogenic causes such as surgery and synovial injections. Horses with orthopaedic infections are generally markedly lame and often require aggressive and prolonged therapy. Early diagnosis can greatly impact treatment outcomes and can be facilitated by careful physical examinations, haematology, diagnostic imaging and timely synovial fluid sampling. Concerted efforts should always be made to obtain a positive bacterial culture and sensitivity. Treatment is focused on antimicrobial therapy with local therapy, including intravenous regional limb perfusion and intrasynovial injections, being employed whenever possible; lavage and debridement; and analgesia and supportive care. Responsible use of antimicrobials and antimicrobial stewardship are critical when treating orthopaedic infections. Prognosis will depend on the source and severity of the infection, the causative agent and the time to intervention. Foals and horses can respond well to treatment and return to soundness with early, aggressive and targeted treatment. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 21-year-old Quarter Horse mare presented with a chronic, progressively worsening left pelvic limb lameness of 3 weeks duration. The initial examination identified a consistent lameness at a walk. Neurological examination showed sensory and gait abnormalities consistent with left femoral nerve dysfunction. The horse minimally advanced the leg cranially and had a shortened stride length at the walk. During the stance phase, the heels of the left hind foot did not contact the ground and the horse quickly took weight off of the limb. Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound and nuclear scintigraphy) examinations did not reveal a cause. Severe lymphocytosis was identified on complete blood cell count (69,600 cells /uL; reference range: 1,500–4,000 cells/uL), suggestive of lymphoma. Postmortem examination revealed focal swelling of the left femoral nerve. Multiple masses were found in the stomach, large colon, adrenal gland, mesentery, heart, and meninges. The entire left pelvic limb was dissected and did not reveal other causes of the gait deficit. Histologic evaluation of the left femoral nerve revealed disseminated intermediate cell size B cell lymphoma, with an immunophenotype suggestive of plasmacytoid differentiation. These lymphocytes infiltrated the femoral nerve at the location of the focal nerve swelling, in addition to other peripheral nerves. This case highlights a horse with an atypical diagnosis of femoral nerve paresis caused by direct neoplastic lymphocyte infiltration, deriving from disseminated B cell lymphoma with plasmacytoid differentiation (neurolymphomatosis). Though rare, disseminated lymphoma with direct nerve infiltration should be considered in horses with peripheral neuropathies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is a neurological disease caused by Sarcocystis neurona. Immunofluorescence antibody tests (IFATs) have been widely used to identify exposure of horses to S. neurona in Brazil. Here we used IFAT to search for IgG antibodies against Sarcocystis falcatula-like (Dal-CG23) and S. neurona (SN138) in sera from 342 horses sampled in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul state (Midwestern), and São Paulo, São Paulo state (Southeastern), Brazil. The 1:25 cutoff value was chosen to maximize sensitivity of the test. IgG antibodies against S. neurona were detected in 239 horses (69.88%), whereas IgG antibodies against S. falcatula-like were detected in 177 horses (51.75%). Sera from 132 horses (38.59%) reacted against both isolates. Absence of reactivity was evidenced in 58/342 horses (16.95%). The lower cutoff used, and the presence of opossums infected with S. falcatula-like and Sarcocystis spp. in the regions where the horses were sampled, might justify the high seroprevalence observed here. Owing to the similarity among antigens targeted in immunoassays, reports on S. neurona-seropositive horses in Brazil may also derive from the exposure of horses to other Sarcocystis species. The role of other Sarcocystis species in causing neurological diseases in horses in Brazil remains unclear. © 2023, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to identify, among the equine welfare indicators included in two available protocols (Assessment Protocol for Horses and AWIN - Welfare Assessment Protocol for Horses), those suitable to assess the welfare of ranch horses and mules in commercial beef cattle ranch in Brazil and report the welfare status of these animals when kept under such management and working conditions. Twenty-two equine animal-based welfare indicators were evaluated in 84 horses and 51 mules from seven commercial ranches located in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Most of the indicators showed no or little changes from an acceptable standard of animal welfare, defined when the welfare indicators were scored 0 or when a small number of animals were scored 1, for variables scored from 0 to 2. Those indicators which indicated frequent welfare problems (forced approach test, hoof problems, body condition score, integument alterations, lesions at mouth corners, and orbital tightening) were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA). Differences between ranches were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test, and between mules and horses, the Mann-Whitney test was used. The first principal component of the PCA indicated that forced approach test and integument alterations were directly associated with each other and inversely associated with body condition score, lesions at mouth corners, hoof condition, and orbital tightening. Ranch 1 showed a higher score on the forced approach test than Ranch 5, which may be related to variations in their handling routines. Mules showed a greater avoidance response during the forced approach test, while horses had a higher incidence of hoof problems, which may be associated with the differences in behavior and anatomy of these animals. We conclude that, except for facial expression indicators, all other animal-based welfare indicators were useful for assessing the welfare of ranch horses and mules, but that they were not sufficient to carry out a complete welfare assessment of these animals, since it lacks proper environmental-based indicators. Thus, we consider this study as a first step towards the development of a specific protocol to assess the welfare of ranch horses and mules. Additionally, our results clearly show that most of the welfare problems identified in this study can be prevented or mitigated by training cowhands on how correctly raise and handle the ranch horses and mules under their care. © 2023

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate ex vivo angiogenesis of equine arterial rings in response to various growth media. ANIMALS Facial arteries were dissected from 11 horses post-euthanasia. Equine platelet lysate (ePL) was harvested from 6 horses. PROCEDURES Arteries were exposed to endothelial growth media (EGM) + horse serum (HS) for first sprout (FS), vascular regression (VR), and (basement membrane matrix [Matrigel]) lysis (ML) evaluation. Additional rings supplemented with (1) EGM, (2) EGM + EDTA, (3) endothelial basal media (EBM), (4) EBM + HS, or (5) EBM + human VEGF were compared for vascular network area (VNA) and maximum network growth (MNG). Additional rings exposed to EGM + ePL at 10-(10xePL), 5-(5xePL), or 2-fold (2xePL) increases from baseline platelet concentration, EGM + HS, EGM + platelet-poor plasma (PPP), EBM + PPP and EBM were analyzed for branch number, density, VNA, and VEGF-A concentration from days 0–3. RESULTS Arteries demonstrated sprouting in Matrigel supplemented with EBM alone. EGM + HS exposure resulted in no differences in FS (P = .3934), VR (P = .0607), or ML (P = .2364) between horses. VNA in EGM + HS was greater than EBM (P = .0015). MNG was greater in EGM + HS, EBM + HS, and EBM + hVEGF compared with EBM (P = .0001). ePL treatment did not have an overall significant angiogenic effect compared with supplementation with HS, PPP, or EBM alone; however, VEGF-A concentrations were higher for EGM + 10xePL, EGM + 5xePL, and EGM-HS compared with EBM and positively correlated with VNA (P = .0243). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Equine arterial rings serve as an ex vivo model for angiogenesis but have a high degree of variability. HS, PPP, or ePL support vascular growth, and HS and ePL may stimulate the secretion and be sources of VEGF-A. © 2023, American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Campeiro horse is a breed locally adapted to the Santa Catarina plateau region and its main characteristic is the gait, it is known as “Marchador das Araucárias.” It is a breed considered in danger of extinction, being fundamental the search for the preservation of this important genetic resource. Surra, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma evansi, is among the diseases that affect horses. However, there are no data on the prevalence of infection in Campeiro horses. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of T. evansi in Campeiro horses, correlate hematology and serum biochemistry, and identify possible risk factors. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture of 214 Campeiro horses, 50 males and 164 females, aged between 3 months and 27 years, from 16 properties located in the States of Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, and Paraná. An epidemiological questionnaire was carried out with the owners to analyze the associated risk factors. The blood samples were submitted to polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence antibody test, complete blood count, and serum biochemistry. The prevalence was 14% of positive animals by polymerase chain reaction and 59% by immunofluorescence antibody test. There was an increase in hematocrit, and in the number of basophils, a decrease in plasmatic fibrinogen, and in the enzymatic activity of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and urea, and an increase in creatine phosphokinase and creatinine in positive animals, which is possibly unrelated to the infection. The data obtained through the epidemiological questionnaires showed no difference. Therefore, T. evansi is present in the South of Brazil, with a high prevalence in Campeiro horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Bisphosphonates are a group of drugs that can reduce bone resorption by incorporating into the crystal structure of exposed hydroxyapatite where they are taken up by osteoclasts. Bisphosphonates have several other mechanisms of action including reducing pain and inflammation and altering macrophage function. There are two types of bisphosphonates–nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous, the latter of which is used in horses. This article provides a literature-based review of the proposed mechanisms of action and therapeutic uses of bisphosphonates including a brief review of bone response to disease. A review of the literature available in horses including safety data and current rules and regulations is also provided. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Background: Shivers in horses is characterized by abnormal hindlimb movement when walking backward and is proposed to be caused by a Purkinje cell (PC) axonopathy based on histopathology. Objectives: Define region-specific differences in gene expression within the lateral cerebellar hemisphere and compare cerebellar protein expression between Shivers horses and controls. Animals: Case-control study of 5 Shivers and 4 control geldings ≥16.2 hands in height. Methods: Using spatial transcriptomics, gene expression was compared between Shivers and control horses in PC soma and lateral cerebellar hemisphere white matter, consisting primarily of axons. Tandem-mass-tag (TMT-11) proteomic analysis was performed on lateral cerebellar hemisphere homogenates. Results: Differences in gene expression between Shivers and control horses were evident in principal component analysis of axon-containing white matter but not PC soma. In white matter, there were 455/1846 differentially expressed genes (DEG; 350 ↓DEG, 105 ↑DEG) between Shivers and controls, with significant gene set enrichment of the Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) cascade, highlighting neuroinflammation. There were 50/936 differentially expressed proteins (DEP). The 27 ↓DEP highlighted loss of axonal proteins including intermediate filaments (5), myelin (3), cytoskeleton (2), neurite outgrowth (2), and Na/K ATPase (1). The 23 ↑DEP were involved in the extracellular matrix (7), cytoskeleton (7), redox balance (2), neurite outgrowth (1), signal transduction (1), and others. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Our findings support axonal degeneration as a characteristic feature of Shivers. Combined with histopathology, these findings are consistent with the known distinctive response of PC to injury where axonal changes occur without a substantial impact on PC soma. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Nutritional factors are suggested to influence the incidence and severity of glandular gastric disease (GGD) in horses. Objectives: To retrospectively assess whether dietary fermentable carbohydrates increase the severity of GGD and to prospectively evaluate whether the partial substitution of concentrates by dehydrated alfalfa would decrease GGD severity scores. Animals: In total, 82 trotters from 4 training centers exercised ≥5 days/week. Methods: Multicenter retrospective observational study, and prospective 2-arm randomized trial. Glandular mucosae were observed by gastroscopy and scored (0-4 severity scale) at day 0 (D0). Biochemical composition of the diet fed was compared between ulcerated and nonulcerated groups. After D0, horses either received the same diet (control, n = 41) or pelleted dehydrated alfalfa substituting 50% concentrates (alfalfa, n = 41). Glandular scores were recorded in both groups after 21 (D21) and 42 days (D42). The first end point was a successful outcome, defined as a horse with a glandular score of 2 to 4 on D0, decreasing to a score of 0 to 1 on days 21 or 42. Results: Horses scored 0 to 1 at D0 ingested more (P =.01) soluble sugars from concentrates than those scored 2 to 4 before D0 (77.5 g/kg BW; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 71.1-84.0, vs 59.1 g/kg BW; 95% CI: 48.0-70.3), whereas starch intake did not differ between groups (P =.24). Among horses scored 2 to 4 at D0, fewer were scored 2 to 4 in the alfalfa group (1 out of 6) compared with the control group (6 out of 6) at D42 (P =.02). Clinical success was 47.7 times more likely in horses fed alfalfa compared with horses in the control group (95% CI: 1.6-1422.8). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Relationships were found between diet composition and integrity of the glandular mucosa. Feeding pelleted dehydrated alfalfa could help to reduce the incidence and severity of GGD. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Sleep disturbance is observed across species, resulting in neurocognitive dysfunction, poor impulse control and poor regulation of negative emotion. Understanding animal sleep disturbance is thus important to understand how environmental factors influence animal sleep and day-to-day welfare. Self-reporting tools for sleep disturbance commonly used in human research to determine sleep quality cannot be transferred to non-verbal animal species research. Human research has, however, successfully used frequency of awakenings to create an objective measurement of sleep quality. The aim of this study was to use a novel sleep-quality scoring system for a non-human mammalian species. Five separate sleep quality indices calculations were developed, using frequency of awakenings, total sleep time and total time spent in different sleep states. These indices were applied to a pre-existing data set of equine sleep behaviour taken from a study investigating the effects of environmental change (lighting and bedding) on the duration of time in different sleep states. Significant treatment effects for index scores both differed and aligned with the original sleep quantity results, thus sleep quality may be a useful alternative measurement of sleep disturbance that could be used to investigate impactful (emotional, cognitive) effects on the animal. © 2023.

ABSTRACT: Both, oral and intravenous (IV) testing protocols, are recommended and still used to detect insulin dysregulation (ID) in equids. However, IV tests mainly focus on peripheral insulin resistance (IR), while oral tests assess hyperinsulinemia (HI), which are different aspects of ID. The objective of this study was to describe if horses with HI also demonstrate IR and consequently can be detected by a modified 2-step insulin response test (2-step IRT) performed with a veterinary approved porcine zinc insulin (PZI). Twelve Icelandic horses were subjected to an OGT and 2-step IRT in a crossover study. Serum insulin concentrations during the OGT revealed that six horses were hyperinsulinemic (HI) while six were not (NON-HI). To describe the glucose response to IV injected PZI, the decline of plasma glucose concentration within the first 30 min was analyzed. Glucose reduction was similar in horses with and without HI during the 2-step IRT over time. Additionally, none of the horses reached a glucose reduction of ≥ 50% at 30 min. The results of the present study indicated that a comparable insulin mediated glucose uptake may be observed in horses with and without HI during a modified 2-step IRT. While six out of twelve horses were identified as HI by the OGT, all twelve horses were identified as IR by the modified 2-step IRT performed with PZI underlining the importance, but difficulty in choosing the right diagnostic tool in clinical settings to assess ID. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The evaluation of the performance levels in athletic horses is of major importance to prevent sports injuries. Raman spectroscopy is an innovative technique that allows for a rapid evaluation of biomolecules in biological fluids. It also permits qualitative and quantitative sample analyses, which lead to the simultaneous determination of the components of the examined biological fluids. On the basis of this, the Raman spectroscopy technique was applied on serum samples collected from five Italian Saddle horses subjected to a standardized obstacle course preceded by a warm-up to evaluate the applicability of this technique for the assessment of central and peripheral fatigue in athletic horses. Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture in a vacutainer tube with a clot activator before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 30 min and 1 h after the end of the obstacle course. Observing the obtained Raman spectra, the major changes due to the experimental conditions appeared in the (1300–1360) cm−1 and (1385–1520) cm−1 bands. In the (1300–1360) cm−1 band, lipids and tryptophan were identified; in the (1385–1520) cm−1 band, leucine, glycine, isoleucine, lactic acid, tripeptide, adenosine, and beta carotene were identified. A significant effect of exercise was recorded on all the sub-bands. In particular, a change immediately after exercise versus before exercise was found. Moreover, the mean lactic concentration was positively correlated with the Raman area of the sub-band assigned to lactic acid. In this context, the application of Raman spectroscopy on blood serum samples represents a useful technique for secondary-structure protein identification to investigate the metabolic changes that occur in athletic horses during physical exercise. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to describe the pharmacokinetics of intra-articular (IA) administered buprenorphine in horses with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synovitis. Radiocarpal synovitis was induced in six healthy adult horses with the IA injection of LPS (0.5 ng/joint) on two occasions in a randomized cross-over design. Treatments (IA buprenorphine (IAB) at 5 μg/kg plus intravenous saline; and intravenous buprenorphine (IVB) at 5 μg/kg plus IA saline) were administered 4 h following LPS injection. Concentrations of buprenorphine were assessed in plasma and synovial fluid (SF) at 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters after IVB and IAB in plasma and synovial fluid were calculated using a nonlinear mixed effects model. IAB was detectable in SF of all horses at 24 h [median concentration of 6.2 (3.46–22.6) ng/mL]. IAB resulted in a median plasma concentration of 0.59 (0.42–1.68) ng/mL at 0.5 h and was detectable in all subjects for up to 6 h and in two horses for up to 12 h. IVB resulted in SF concentrations detected up to 6 h in all horses [median concentration of 0.12 (0.07–0.82) ng/mL]. Results suggest that IA buprenorphine remains present in the inflamed joint for at least 24 h and systemic absorption occurs. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Lyme disease, caused by some strains of bacterial spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), affects humans but also domestic animals including horses. The primary pathogens in horses in Europe are B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. To our knowledge, there are no data available on the seropositivity of B. burgdorferi s.l. in horses from the Czech Republic. In this country, horses are mainly used for sport, breeding, and recreational riding in areas where vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. are present, which is why they are frequently at risk of infection. The aim of the study was to detect anti-borrelia IgM and IgG antibodies in clinically healthy and sick horses from the Czech Republic and to evaluate the risk factors of infection. In total, sera of 262 horses (247 clinically healthy horses and 15 horses hospitalized due to symptoms of encephalitis/meningoencephalitis) were examined by an indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positivity of B. burgdorferi was 27% (66/247) in clinically healthy horses (21% IgM, 7% IgG and 3% IgM + IgG antibodies) and 20% (3/15) in horses with clinical signs (20% IgM, 7% IgG and 7% IgM + IgG). In the clinically healthy horses, positivity statistically differed (p ≤ 0.05) only in Pony and Warmblood breeds, being the most affected at 32% and 30%, respectively, while other characteristics (sex, age, usage and localities) had no effect on positivity. This is the first survey of antibodies to B. burgdorferi s.l. in Czech horses showing that horses are exposed to ticks infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. This should be taken into account when making differential diagnoses in patients with non-specific symptoms to start with adequate therapy. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a novel class of compounds that have not yet been clinically approved; however, they appear to have a better anabolic/androgenic ratio than steroids and cause slighter side effects. Sports drug testing laboratories are required to maintain continuously updated doping control analytical methods in light of the widespread misuse of SARMs in elite and amateur sports. This paper describes the metabolic conversion of SARM GSK2881078 in thoroughbred horses following oral administration and in vitro with equine liver microsomes. A liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry method was used to postulate the plausible structures of the detected metabolites. A total of five (M1–M5) in vivo metabolites and six (M1–M6) in vitro metabolites were detected under experimental conditions. Phase I metabolites mainly result from hydroxylation. Methoxylated and side-chain dissociated metabolites were also detected. Neither sulfonic acid nor glucuronic acid conjugated metabolites were observed in this study. Data reported here could aid in the detection of nonsteroidal SARM GSK2881078 and reveal its illicit use in competitive sports. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The influences of diet and environmental factors on gut microbial profiles have been widely acknowledged; however, the specific roles of host genetics remain uncertain. To unravel host genetic effects, we raised 47 Jeju crossbred (Jeju × Thoroughbred) foals that exhibited higher genetic diversity. Foals were raised under identical environmental conditions and diets. Microbial composition revealed that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes were the predominant phyla. We identified 31 host–microbiome associations by utilizing 47,668 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 734 taxa with quantitative trait locus (QTL) information related to horse growth. The taxa involved in 31 host–microbiome associations were functionally linked to carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolic processes, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and lactic acid production. Abundances of these taxa were affected by specific SNP genotypes. Most growth-associated SNPs are found between genes. The rs69057439 and rs69127732 SNPs are located within the introns of the VWA8 and MFSD6 genes, respectively. These genes are known to affect energy balance and metabolism. These discoveries emphasize the significant effect of host SNPs on the development of the intestinal microbiome during the initial phases of life and provide insights into the influence of gut microbial composition on horse growth. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Anabolic androgenic steroids are synthetic substances related to the male sex hormones (androgens). These agents promote the growth of skeletal muscle (anabolic effects) and the development of male sexual characteristics (androgenic effects). Anabolic steroids have been illegally used for many years as performance-enhancing drugs in human, equine, and canine sports and as growth promoters in livestock reared to provide meat for human consumption. The analytical challenge to developing effective means of control within these fields has been exacerbated by the reported endogenous nature of some of these steroids. Anabolic steroids have been employed extensively in equine practice over the past 50 years. Their usefulness is largely dependent on subjective opinions, as only minimal studies investigating pharmacodynamics have been carried out in horses. Therefore, their use will vary markedly between practitioners depending on their personal experiences and pressures by trainers to use them. They form part of rational therapy in a variety of conditions. In addition to their use for increasing muscle mass, they are used to varying extents in the raising of yearlings and in the training and racing of horses with the view of improving performance. The use of these agents is prohibited in the horseracing industry by the Association of Racing Commissioners International (ARCI), International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA), and Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI). © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Nanopore sequencing is a third-generation biopolymer sequencing technique that relies on monitoring the changes in an electrical current that occur as nucleic acids are passed through a protein nanopore. Increasing quality of reads generated by nanopore sequencing systems encourages their application in genome-wide polymorphism detection and genotyping. In this study, we employed nanopore sequencing to identify genome-wide polymorphisms in the horse genome. To reduce the size and complexity of genome fragments for sequencing in a simple and cost-efficient manner, we amplified random DNA fragments using a modified DOP-PCR and sequenced the resulting products using the MinION system. After initial filtering, this generated 28,426 polymorphisms, which were validated at a 3% error rate. Upon further filtering for polymorphism and reproducibility, we identified 9495 SNPs that reflected the horse population structure. To conclude, the use of nanopore sequencing, in conjunction with a genome enrichment step, is a promising tool that can be practical in a variety of applications, including genotyping, population genomics, association studies, linkage mapping, and potentially genomic selection. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Accelerated idioventricular rhythms (AIVR) are increasingly diagnosed in horses, particularly in those with underlying systemic disease. Recognition of these abnormal rhythms is important but specific treatment is often not necessary unless the rhythms become haemodynamically relevant, with AIVR often resolving as the systemic disease improves. The goals of treatment, when indicated, include improving cardiac output, decreasing systemic and myocardial inflammation (if present) and controlling the ventricular rate and rhythm. Identification of any persistent myocardial damage or arrhythmia burden will be important for the prognosis and risk assessment of these patients in the longer term. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Equine veterinarians face a range of challenges when attending competition horses. Athletic goals may significantly impact veterinary decision making, and the veterinarian’s work can be complicated by reputational considerations and rival opinions during an assessment of whether a horse is “fit to compete”. Using an online questionnaire, we found that the majority of German, Austrian and Swiss equine veterinarians (N = 172) surveyed agreed that the owners of competition horses are more likely than owners of leisure horses to approach them with clear treatment ideas, and that the former have higher expectations of the medical services provided. The data also show that the veterinarian’s reputation plays a more important role in the competition sphere. Using a case vignette, we established that, on the grounds of equine welfare, the majority of respondents indicated that they would decide against starting a dressage horse with low-grade lameness in a competition. Those respondents who indicated that they would approve a start of the dressage horse indicated that a horse with a low-grade lameness was fit enough “to compete”. We conclude that clearer definitions of phrases, such as “fit to compete”, may be helpful in guiding veterinarians as they discharge their professional responsibilities during competitions and reduce the reputational stress they experience in this working context. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration carries risks of gastrointestinal toxicity. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (“coxibs”) were designed to reduce risks of adverse effects but are still associated with gastrointestinal complications in humans. The effect of coxibs on colonic inflammation and integrity in horses is unknown. The study objective was to compare the effects of the coxib firocoxib and the nonselective NSAID flunixin meglumine on ultrasonographic indicators of colonic inflammation in healthy horses. Twelve healthy adult horses were administered flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg IV q12h) and omeprazole (1 mg/kg PO q24h) for 5 days, allowed a 6-month washout period, then administered firocoxib (0.3 mg/kg PO once, then 0.1 mg/kg PO q24h for 4 days) and omeprazole. Transabdominal ultrasonographic examination and serum chemistry profiles were performed at the beginning and end of each treatment week. Colon wall thickness increased over time when horses received firocoxib (median post treatment 5.8 mm, interquartile range 2.8 mm; P < 001), but not flunixin (median 3 mm, interquartile range 1.2 mm; P = .7) and was significantly greater following firocoxib compared to flunixin (P = .003). Subjectively, colonic edema was noted more frequently following treatment with firocoxib (11/12 horses), compared to flunixin (1/12 horses). There were no clinically significant alterations in hematologic parameters after administration of either drug. The increase in colon wall thickness following treatment with the COX-2 selective NSAID firocoxib may suggest a risk of subclinical colitis in healthy horses. Monitoring colonic health when NSAIDs are used in a clinical setting is warranted. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: To facilitate exploration of the immense range of gastrointestinal parasites in horses and the impact of parasitism on equine health, the present study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and risk factors associated with these infections in horses reared in different management systems in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Samples were collected from 208 horses: 91 from extensive, 64 from semi-extensive, and 53 from intensive rearing systems. The identified helminths included those of the Strongylida order (80.29%), Parascaris equorum (3.36%), Oxyuris equi (4.33%), and Anoplocephala spp. (1.92%). By analyzing the coproculture results to differentiate among Strongylida order parasites, species such as Strongylus vulgaris, S. edentatus, S. equinus, Triodontophorus spp., and Trichostrongylus axei, in addition to members of the Cyathostominae subfamily, which include Gyalocephalus capitatus and Poteriostomum spp., were identified. The only positive sample of protozoa was that of Cryptosporidium spp. (13%). Regarding the rearing system, animals in the extensive system had a higher proportion of infected horses and a higher chance of infection than those in the other systems. For the variable co-grazing with cattle, only cyathostomins showed a significant difference with relatively low infection risk in co-grazing. Overall, the present study demonstrated a high occurrence of equine gastrointestinal parasites, especially those of the Strongylida order, with emphasis on small strongylids. In addition, analyzing factors associated with infection showed that management variables are important for controlling parasitism in horses. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Clostridioides difficile poses an ongoing threat as a cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals. Traditionally considered a human healthcare-related disease, increases in community-associated C. difficile infection (CDI) and growing evidence of inter-species transmission suggest a wider perspective is required for CDI control. In horses, C. difficile is a major cause of diarrhoea and life-threatening colitis. This study aimed to better understand the epidemiology of CDI in Australian horses and provide insights into the relationships between horse, human and environmental strains. A total of 752 faecal samples from 387 Western Australian horses were collected. C. difficile was isolated from 104 (30.9%) horses without gastrointestinal signs and 19 (37.8%) with gastrointestinal signs. Of these, 68 (55.3%) harboured one or more toxigenic strains, including C. difficile PCR ribotypes (RTs) 012 (n = 14), 014/020 (n = 10) and 087 (n = 7), all prominent in human infection. Whole-genome analysis of 45 strains identified a phylogenetic cluster of 10 closely related C. difficile RT 012 strains of equine, human and environmental origin (0–62 SNP differences; average 23), indicating recent shared ancestry. Evidence of possible clonal inter-species transmission or common-source exposure was identified for a subgroup of three horse and one human isolates, highlighting the need for a One Health approach to C. difficile surveillance. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Computed tomography (CT) has become a routine method to examine the equine skull. Its clinical use for the diagnosis of diseases of the incisors and canine teeth has not been reported so far. The goal of this study was to study the prevalence and relationship of single CT features and equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) in equine incisors and canine teeth. In this descriptive retrospective study, helical CT studies of 115 Warmblood horses of the age of 5 years or older examined between 2007 and 2020 for reasons unrelated to the incisors and canine teeth were included. Resorption in the crown or root, hypercementosis, widening of the periodontal space, clubbing of the root, lysis of the lamina dura, an abnormal pulp cavity and fracture of the root were recorded in all incisors and canine teeth. The length of the pulp cavity and the labial and lingual/palatal length of the enamel and root was measured in each incisor and canine tooth. Additionally, the angulation was assessed in each incisor. The variable EOTRH was defined based on the presence of resorptive lesions, hypercementosis and clubbing. In result median age of the included horses was 12 years (range, 5-29 years). With regard to the investigated population of horses, 44.3 % of all horses had normal incisors whereas 55.7 % of the horses had mild EOTRH changes in one incisor at least. Regarding the canine teeth, 54.7 % of the horses had normal canine teeth whereas 43.3 % horses had mild EOTRH in one canine tooth at least. With regard to all investigated teeth, 868 teeth (53.0 %) were classified as normal, whereas 769 incisors and canine teeth (47.0 %) showed at least one abnormal CT criterion. Clubbing of the root and hypercementosis were most common (37.1 % and 22.7 %, respectively) and EOTRH was present in 27.1 % of all teeth. Mild changes were more common than moderate or severe abnormalities. In the lower jaw, hypercementosis and widening of the periodontal space at the anatomical root and apex of the root was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004 and 0.02), whereas clubbing of the root was more common in the upper jaw (p = 0.009). In canine teeth, resorption in the anatomical crown and anatomical root, widening of the periodontal space, clubbing and lysis of the lamina dura were significantly more common whereas hypercementosis was more common in incisors (p < 0.001). Frequency of certain CT changes significantly increased from central to middle and corner incisors. Severity of all single CT criteria as well as prevalence and severity of EOTRH significantly increased with age (r = 0.08-0.56). Linear forward and backward multivariate regression analysis confirmed a significant association between prevalence and severity of EOTRH and age, changes of the pulp cavity, widening of the periodontal space at the anatomical rootand incisor group (central, middle, corner) (p = 0.01 - < 0.001). In conclusion computed tomographic changes of the incisors and canine teeth are common and age-related in Warmblood horses. Therefore, treatment of EOTRH should not be based on diagnostic imaging alone, but always in combination with a thorough clinical examination. © 2023 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf.

ABSTRACT: Infection with bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 results in the most common skin tumor of horses, termed equine sarcoid. The persistent and recurrent nature of this tumor stands in contrast to the regressive nature of BPV-1/− 2 induced cutaneous papillomas in cattle. The circulation of horse-specific BPV-1/− 2 variants within equine populations has been suggested as a possible explanation for the difference in clinical presentation of BPV-1/− 2 infection between horses and cattle. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we identified 98 complete BPV-1/− 2 genomes using a Nanopore sequencing approach. Separate BPV-1/− 2 alignments were used to infer Bayesian phylogenetic trees. Phylogeny-trait association concerning host species was investigated using Bayesian Tip-association Significance software (BaTS) Overall, 179 unique BPV-1 and 128 BPV-2 substitutions were found. The E2 coding region in the viral genome exhibited an exceptionally high rate of non-synonymous mutations (81 %, n = 13/16). Interestingly, extensive deletions in the L1/L2 region (up to 1.5 kb) were found exclusively in horse-derived samples. Nevertheless, the most frequently detected single nucleotide polymorphisms were shared between equine and bovine hosts, which is in agreement with BaTS results indicating no phylogeny-host correlation. We found indications that horse-specific mutations might exist in subpopulations of equine derived BPV-1/− 2, but these did not result in horse-adapted genetic variants. Based on these observations, cross-species transmission from cattle to horses seems to be an ongoing process, rather than an ancient occurrence that has been followed by the circulation of horse-adapted BPV variants in the horse population.. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Tabanids constitute an important group of hematophagous insects that can transmit zoonoses, but with studies on the ecological distribution of species still neglected in the Amazon. We evaluated the role of mangrove forests and estuarine floodplains located inside and outside a conservation unit (UC) on the coast of Marajó Island, Amazon River estuary, on the diversity and distribution of tabanids. Specifically, we studied whether the community of mangrove and estuarine floodplain tabanids located inside and outside the UC differ in abundance, richness, and species composition. We collected tabanids using a Malaise trap at 40 sampling points, resulting in 637 specimens distributed in 13 species and one morphotype, representing approximately 37% of the tabanid fauna ever recorded for the Marajó Island. There was no significant difference in the richness and composition of tabanids between the phytophysiognomies, but the abundance was significantly different, with greater abundance in the mangrove. The areas inside and around the UC had an influence on the tabanids, with the areas inside the UC having the highest number of specimens and species, also influencing the species composition. Two species are new records for the Marajó Island, bringing the number of species recorded to 38. Our results suggest that, along the Amazonian coast, mangroves and estuarine floodplains maintain part of the diversity of tabanids known for the Brazilian Amazon. Our data also indicate that the region’s UC provides potentially important habitats for the maintenance of local tabanid populations. © 2023, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The optimal approach to incorporate radiation therapy (RT) in conjunction with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CART) for relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (bNHL) remains unclear. This study documented the RT local control rate among patients who received bridging radiation therapy (BRT) before CART and compares it with those who received salvage radiation therapy (SRT) after CART. This article further reports on a promising way to use SRT for post-CART disease and identifies predictors for RT in-field recurrence. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 83 patients with r/r bNHL who received CART and RT, either as BRT pre-CART infusion (n = 35) or as SRT post-CART infusion (n = 48), between 2018 and 2021. RT was defined as comprehensive (compRT; ie, treated all sites of active disease) or focal (focRT). Limited disease was defined as disease amenable to compRT, involving <5 active disease sites. Results: At time of RT, patients who received BRT before CART had bulkier disease sites (median diameter, 8.7 vs 5.5 cm; P = .01) and were treated to significantly lower doses (median equivalent 2-Gy dose, 23.3 vs 34.5 Gy; P = .002), compared with SRT post-CART. Among 124 total irradiated sites identified, 8 of 59 (13%) bridged sites and 21 of 65 (32%) salvaged sites experienced in-field recurrence, translating to 1-year local control rates (LC) of 84% and 62%, respectively (P = .009). Patients with limited post-CART disease (n = 37) who received compSRT (n = 26) had better overall survival (51% vs 12%; P = .028), freedom from subsequent progression (31% vs 0%; P < .001), and freedom from subsequent event (19% vs 0%; P = .011) compared with patients with limited disease who received focSRT (n = 11). Conclusions: BRT followed by CART appears to be associated with improved LC compared with SRT in r/r bNHL. Nonetheless, SRT offers a promising salvage intervention for limited (<5 sites) relapsed post-CART disease if given comprehensively. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horse owners' motivators and barriers for consent to exploratory laparotomy are poorly understood. Objectives: To (1) determine the proportion of Australian and New Zealand horse owners who would consent to exploratory laparotomy and (2) identify motivators and barriers for consent. Study design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: A questionnaire was developed and distributed online. Descriptive statistics were calculated by tabulating respondents by their answers to whether they would consent to exploratory laparotomy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify variables associated with consenting to exploratory laparotomy. Results: Two thousand two hundred horse owners participated with a 68.3% survey completion rate. Most were female (95.6%), and 18.7% stated they would consent to exploratory laparotomy, 55.2% would consider exploratory laparotomy and 26.1% would not consent to exploratory laparotomy being performed on their horse. Geographical location, intended use of the horse and perceptions regarding the cost and prognosis of exploratory laparotomy, as well as the previous experience of respondents significantly impacted the decision. Self-reported level of financial comfort, gender of respondents, number of horses owned and pre-existing relationship with nearest equine referral clinic did not impact the decision. Top motivators for exploratory laparotomy were high probability of survival, trust in hospital, emotional value of horse and the alternative being euthanasia. Top barriers for exploratory laparotomy were financial cost, uncertain outcome, welfare concern and age of the horse. Main limitations: Self-selection bias and acquiescence in responses. Conclusions: Most respondents indicated that they would consider or consent to exploratory laparotomy. Several factors for owners to decide for exploratory laparotomy could be identified. Improved owner education regarding the positively reported survival rates for exploratory laparotomy would be beneficial. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Traditional visual lameness assessment is subjective. Ethograms have been developed for evaluating pain and objective sensors to detect lameness. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) have been used to evaluate stress and pain. The aim of our study was to compare subjective and behavioral lameness scores, a sensor system measuring movement asymmetry, HR, and HRV. We hypothesized that these measures would show related trends. In 30 horses, an inertial sensor system was used to measure movement asymmetries during trot in-hand. A horse was categorized as sound if each asymmetry was less than 10 mm. We recorded riding to observe lameness and evaluate behavior. Heart rate and RR intervals were measured. Root mean squares of successive RR intervals (RMSSD) were calculated. Five horses were categorized as sound and 25 horses as lame by the inertial sensor system. No significant differences were detected between sound and lame horses in the ethogram, subjective lameness score, HR, and RMSSD. Overall asymmetry, ethogram, and lameness score had no significant correlation with each other, whereas overall asymmetry and ethogram correlated significantly with HR and RMSSD during certain phases of the ridden exercise. The main limitation of our study was the small number of sound horses detected by the inertial sensor system. The association between gait asymmetry and HRV suggests that the more gait asymmetry a horse shows during trot in-hand, the more pain or discomfort it probably experiences when ridden with a higher intensity. The threshold for lameness used by the inertial sensor system may require further evaluation. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The interpretation of the blood count is essential to help the equine clinician in the diagnosis, prognosis, patient management, and control of equine diseases. Hematologic alterations often reflect the condition of the individual or an overall response to a pathological situation. A thorough clinical examination of the patient is essential to correctly interpret the hematological results. The most common abnormalities in the erythrogram are mainly anemia and polycythemia. The frequent causes of anemia in horses are acute and chronic blood loss, hemolytic anemia, and anemia caused by chronic disease. Evaluation of leukogram, including a total white cell count, a differential cell count, absolute numbers of specific leukocytes can help identify abnormalities that may suggest specific diseases such as a viral or bacterial infection, inflammatory disorders or even a neoplastic process. The platelet count is most often used to monitor or diagnose conditions that cause too much bleeding related with thrombocytopenia; it can be due to multiple mechanisms such as reduction of thrombopoiesis (myeloptisis, myelofibrosis, myeloproliferative disease, and idiopathic medullary aplasias or due to the effect of mielosuppresive drugs), increased peripheral destruction of platelets (immune mediated thrombocytopenia), consumption (dissemined intravascular coagulation) sequestration of the spleen and loss of platelets by idiopathic origin © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Pelvic abscesses occur in horses of all ages and breeds. Although conservative management may be successful, surgical drainage may be necessary for larger abscesses or in case of secondary intestinal obstruction. The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of pelvic abscesses that were successfully drained using indwelling chest tubes, repeated lavages and targeted antibiotic treatment. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The transmural ultrasound allows for the definition of the normal appearance of the hoof tissues and internal structures. Determining such measurements and proportions could contribute to evaluations of the normal spatial distal phalanx–hoof relationship. The objective was to describe the hoof’s dermis and epidermis measurements using the transmural technique, in comparison with DR and anatomical sections. Sixty-two healthy hooves without digital radiographic abnormalities, made up of 30 anatomical pieces (phase 1) and 32 alive horse hooves (phase 2), and 16 sagittal sections of the first ones were used. The proximal and distal planes were compared, defining the following measurements: coronary band-extensor process, distal phalanx apex–hoof wall, sole dermis, middle stratum, parietal dermis, lamellar layer, the sublamellar dermis, and ratios between them. Most of the measurements were consistent among methods. Some showed measurement differences and a minority was impossible to determine. The transmural technique allowed for the observation and replication of measurements of the hoof structures, described with other diagnostic aids. It also allowed for the implementation of new measurements that would help to determine the spatial location of the distal phalanx. Additionally, it contributes to the visualization of normal findings, which will be useful to compare variations in the different phases of laminitis. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The association between rider–saddle interaction and horse kinematics has been little studied. It was hypothesized that differences in a thigh block design would influence (a) rider–saddle interface pressures, (b) rider kinematics, and (c) equine limb/spinal kinematics. Eighteen elite sport horses/riders were trotted using correctly fitted dressage saddles with thigh blocks S (vertical face) and F (deformable face). Contact area, mean, and peak pressure between rider and saddle were determined using an on-saddle pressure mat. Spherical markers allowed for the measurement of horse/rider kinematics using two-dimensional video analysis. The kinematics of the equine thoracolumbosacral spine were obtained using skin-mounted inertial measuring units. Results were compared between thigh blocks (paired t-test p ≤ 0.05). With F, the contact area, mean, and peak pressure between rider and saddle were significantly higher (p = 0.0001), and the rider trunk anterior tilt was reduced, indicating altered rider–saddle interaction. The horse thoracic axial rotation and flexion/extension were reduced (p = 0.01–0.03), caudal thoracic and lumbar lateral bend was increased (p = 0.02–0.04), and carpal flexion increased (p = 0.01–0.05) with F compared to S. During straight-line locomotion when in sitting trot, thigh block F was associated with altered rider–saddle interaction and rider and equine kinematics, leading to a more consistent rider–saddle interface, a more upright rider trunk during stance, an increased horse thoracic stability and lumbar lateral bend, and forelimb flexion, supporting the importance of optimising rider–saddle–horse interaction. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate the impact of a 30% end-inspiratory pause (EIP) on alveolar tidal volume (VTalv), airway (VDaw) and physiological (VDphys) dead spaces in mechanically ventilated horses using volumetric capnography, and to evaluate the effect of EIP on carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination per breath (VCO2br–1), PaCO2, and the ratio of PaO2-to-fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2:FIO2). Study design: Prospective research study. Animals: A group of eight healthy research horses undergoing laparotomy. Methods: Anesthetized horses were mechanically ventilated as follows: 6 breaths minute–1, tidal volume (VT) 13 mL kg–1, inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio 1:2, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cmH2O and EIP 0%. VCO2br–1 and expired tidal volume (VTE) of 10 consecutive breaths were recorded 30 minutes after induction, after adding 30% EIP and upon EIP removal to construct volumetric capnograms. A stabilization period of 15 minutes was allowed between phases. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effect linear model. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The EIP decreased VDaw from 6.6 (6.1–6.7) to 5.5 (5.3–6.1) mL kg–1 (p < 0.001) and increased VTalv from 7.7 ± 0.7 to 8.6 ± 0.6 mL kg–1 (p = 0.002) without changing the VTE. The VDphys to VTE ratio decreased from 51.0% to 45.5% (p < 0.001) with EIP. The EIP also increased PaO2:FIO2 from 393.3 ± 160.7 to 450.5 ± 182.5 mmHg (52.5 ± 21.4 to 60.0 ± 24.3 kPa; p < 0.001) and VCO2br–1 from 0.49 (0.45–0.50) to 0.59 (0.45–0.61) mL kg–1 (p = 0.008) without reducing PaCO2. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The EIP improved oxygenation and reduced VDaw and VDphys, without reductions in PaCO2. Future studies should evaluate the impact of different EIP in healthy and pathological equine populations under anesthesia. © 2023 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: Biological control with nematophagous fungi can be used to reduce populations of intestinal parasites, since these are their natural antagonists, minimizing the use of chemical anthelmintics. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the combined effect of two nematophagous fungi Duddingtonia flagrans and Pochonia chlamydosporia in the biological control of gastrointestinal helminthoses in horses kept on pasture. Thirty six mares were divided into three groups, one control and two trated, for twelve months. As for the group of animals treated with fungi, inwhich animals in which the animals received a dose of 1 g of formulation containing 105 chlamydospores of D. flagrans and 105 chlamydospores of P. chlamydosporia per gram of the commercial product for each 10 kg of body weight, per day. The group Abamectin, with the animals being treated every 3 months with the anthelmintic 1% abamectin, at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg, administered orally. The proceeding of all treatments was evaluated based on the count of eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) with samples of faeces collected every 28 days and preparation of fecal cultures to identify the different genera of infective larvae, count of infective larvae retrieved from the pasture and microbiological analysis of the faeces. The data were submitted for analysis of variance and means were compared by Tukey's test (5%). The overall average of EPG in the control group was 635 (±61.7); as for the fungi group, 385 (±60.4) and in the abamectin group 313 (±67.3), showing a statistically significant difference in the group treated with fungi and abamectin in comparison to the control group, with the control group having the highest averages, while the two other treated groups were overall similar. In the count of infective larvae retrieved from the pasture, the general averages presented in the control group was 2267 (±789.4), the group treated with fungi 1100 (±384.8) and the group abamectin 3115 (±1038.4), writing down that the three groups differed significantly from each other, given that the group being treated with fungi presented the lowest overall average. The fecal cultures showed a predominance of small strongyles in the three groups. It is concluded that the use of Duddingtonia flagrans and Pochonia chlamydosporia fungi is efficient in the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in horses kept on pasture, promoting a reduction in pasture infestation by infective larvae and so the degree of helminthoses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Synopsis A gene's response to an environment is tightly bound to the underlying genetic variation present in an individual s genome and varies greatly depending on the tissue it is being expressed in. Gene co-expression networks provide a mechanism to understand and interpret the collective transcriptional responses of genes. Here, we use the Camoco co-expression network framework to characterize the transcriptional landscape of adipose and gluteal muscle tissue in 83 domestic horses (Equus caballus) representing 5 different breeds. In each tissue, gene expression profiles, capturing transcriptional response due to variation across individuals, were used to build two separate, tissue-focused, genotypically-diverse gene co-expression networks. The aim of our study was to identify significantly co-expressed clusters of genes in each tissue, then compare the clusters across networks to quantify the extent that clusters were found in both networks as well as to identify clusters found in a single network. The known and unknown functions for each network were quantified using complementary, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. First, supervised ontological enrichment was utilized to quantify biological functions represented by each network. Curated ontologies (gene ontology [GO] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes [KEGG]) were used to measure the known biological functions present in each tissue. Overall, a large percentage of terms (40.3% of GO and 41% of KEGG) were coexpressed in at least one tissue. Many terms were co-expressed in both tissues; however, a small proportion of terms exhibited single tissue co-expression suggesting functional differentiation based on curated, functional annotation. To complement this, an unsupervised approach not relying on ontologies was employed. Strongly co-expressed sets of genes defined by Markov clustering identified sets of unannotated genes showing similar patterns of co-expression within a tissue. We compared gene sets across tissues and identified clusters of genes the either segregate in co-expression by tissue or exhibit high levels of co-expression in both tissues. Clusters were also integrated with GO and KEGG ontologies to identify gene sets containing previously curated annotations versus unannotated gene sets indicating potentially novel biological function. Coupling together these transcriptional datasets, we mapped the transcriptional landscape of muscle and adipose setting up a generalizable framework for interpreting gene function for additional tissues in the horse and other species. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

ABSTRACT: Cues such as the human pointing gesture, gaze or proximity to an object are widely used in behavioural studies to evaluate animals’ abilities to follow human-given cues. Many domestic mammals, such as horses, can follow human cues; however, factors influencing their responses are still unclear. We assessed the performance of 57 horses at a two-way choice task testing their ability to follow cues of either a familiar (N = 28) or an unfamiliar informant (N = 29). We investigated the effects of the length of the relationship between the horse and a familiar person (main caregiver), their social environment (living alone, in dyads, or in groups) and their physical environment (living in stalls/paddocks, alternating between paddocks and pastures, or living full time in pastures). We also controlled for the effects of horses’ age and sex. Our results showed that horses’ success rate at the task was not affected by the familiarity of the informant and did not improve with the relationship length with the familiar informant but did increase with the age of the horses. Horses living in groups had better success than the ones kept either in dyads or alone. Finally, horses housed in small paddocks had lower success than those living on pasture. These results indicate that with age, horses get better at following human-given indications regardless of who the human informant is and that an appropriate living and social environment could contribute to the development of socio-cognitive skills towards humans. Therefore, such aspects should be considered in studies evaluating animal behaviour. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The role of hoof morphology is increasingly recognized as a factor associated with lameness incidence in performance horses. The primary objective was to evaluate effect of training initiation on hoof unevenness in Quarter Horses (n = 42; 29 2-year-olds, 13 3-year-olds) over 6-months (m) in training (m0, m2, m4, and m6). Horses were objectively assessed for lameness (inertial sensor system) and photographs and radiographs of feet were taken. Hoof measurements were taken (palmar/plantar angles, frog base width/length, toe length/angle, heel length/angle, heel/foot width, wall height/angle), and analyzed with regards to laterality. Front and hindfoot pairs were determined even if toe angles were within 1.5°. Statistical analyses were performed (Fisher's exact test, mixed-model linear regression, P < .05). There were no differences in distal phalanx palmar/plantar angle between lame/nonlame forelimbs (P = .54) or hindlimbs (P = .20). Unevenness between front feet was seen in toe angle m6 (P < .001), heel length m6 (P = .01) and heel angle over time (P = .006). Unevenness between hind feet was seen at m6 in toe angle (P < .001), heel length (P = .009) and heel angle (P = .02). Lameness incidence did not differ between even and uneven footed horses in forelimbs (P = .64) or hindlimbs (P = .09). In uneven feet, there was no difference in lameness between high versus low foot in forelimbs (P = .34) or hindlimbs (P = .29). Limitations include lack of control group not entering training, lack of consistency in timing data collection to previous trimming, and small sample size. In summary, differences in foot measurements and laterality were noted over time following training initiation in juvenile Western performance horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pathological arrhythmia affecting performance horses and is termed paroxysmal (pAF) when self-terminating to sinus rhythm. Little is known about pAF as its sporadic nature makes it difficult to diagnose. Therefore, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring devices, such as implantable loop recorders (ILR), are necessary to detect the time of onset and episode duration. This case report presents the detection of pAF in a 9-year-old Warmblood horse after successful transvenous electrical cardioversion (TVEC). An ILR continuously monitored the heart rhythm over 28 months and detected 12 episodes of pAF of which two episodes were associated with reduced performance, while others occurred asymptomatically at rest. The estimated episode duration ranged from 6 min to 46.5 h. The antiarrhythmic drug sotalol (2 mg/kg bwt BID PO) was given prior to TVEC and then for 4 weeks. As episodes continued to occur, sotalol was prescribed for another 4 weeks, 6 months after TVEC. Continuous monitoring after TVEC allows for detection of AF recurrence and identification of AF burden, approximate time of onset and possible identification of trigger events. Early diagnosis and antiarrhythmic treatment may prevent a progression to persistent AF. © 2022 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To investigate if hepatitis A virus cell receptor 1/kidney injury molecule 1 (HAVCR1/KIM1) in urine is detectable concurrently with increases in serum creatinine concentrations in horses receiving a recommended dose of phenylbutazone (PBZ) for 7 days. Design: Preliminary study. Methods: Ten clinically healthy horses with normal physical examination and laboratory work were randomly assigned to PBZ or placebo groups (5 each). The PBZ group received PBZ at 4.4 mg/kg mixed with corn syrup orally every 12 hours. The placebo group received corn syrup orally every 12 hours. Both groups were treated for 7 days. Kidney ultrasonography was performed, and venous blood and urine samples were collected prior to commencement and at the end of treatment. Samples from 1 additional healthy horse, 3 horses with acute kidney failure, and 1 horse with chronic kidney failure were also evaluated. Results: None of the 10 horses had detectable HAVCR1/KIM1 in urine at baseline. Serum creatinine concentrations in placebo group did not increase, and HAVCR1/KIM1 was undetectable in urine. At the end of treatment, 3 of 5 horses receiving PBZ developed increases in serum creatinine of >26.5 μmol/L (>0.3 mg/dL), and HAVCR1/KIM1 was detectable in urine, despite normal findings on kidney ultrasonography in all horses. Conclusions: HAVCR1/KIM1 is detectable in urine and is associated with increases in serum creatinine concentrations of >26.5 μmol/L in horses following treatment with PBZ for 7 consecutive days. Thus, HAVCR1/KIM1 might aid in the early detection of acute kidney injury in horses. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: Gastric impactions (GI) have been identified as primary lesions (lone GI; LGI) or associated with other intestinal lesions (concurrent GI; CGI). Anecdotally, CGI resolve more rapidly with a better prognosis than LGI. Objectives: To determine clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic findings, and short- and long-term survival in horses with GI. We hypothesized that LGI carries a worse prognosis than CGI. Animals.: Seventy-one horses from 2 referral hospitals (2007-2022). Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Gastric impactions were defined as feed extending to the margo plicatus after ≥24 hours of fasting. Clinical, diagnostic and outcome findings were compared between LGI and CGI. Long-term survival was determined by a questionnaire. Results: Twenty-seven horses had LGI, 44 had CGI. Large intestinal lesions (32/44) were more common than small intestinal lesions (12/44). Concurrent gastric impactions resolved more slowly than LGI (LGI median 2 days, range 0-8; CGI median 4 days, range 1-10; P =.003). Short- (LGI 63%, 17/27; CGI 59%, 26/44; P =.75) and long-term survival (LGI 3.5 ± 1.9 years; CGI 2.3 ± 2.3 years; P =.42) were not significantly different. However, Lone gastric impactions were more likely to experience gastric rupture (LGI 29.6%, 8/27; CGI 11.4%, 5/44; P =.05). Lone gastric impactions were 8.7 times more likely to require dietary changes (LGI 72.7%, 8/11; CGI 25%, 4/16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-49.22; P =.01). Gastric impactions recurred in 21.7% (LGI, 6/20; CGI, 4/26; P =.23) of affected horses. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Lone gastric impactions and CGI present similarly with a comparable prognosis, but LGI are more likely to rupture. Long-term dietary changes are often necessary for horses with LGI. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to analyze effect of physical exercise in hemogasometric and electrolytic profiles of young Mangalarga Marchador horses beginning training for gait competitions. Six Mangalarga Marchador gaited horses with 6 months of training were evaluated. The ages ranged from three and a half to five years and included four stallions and two mares, with mean (±S.D.) body weight of 435±30Kg. Venous blood samples were collected from the horses, rectal temperature and HR were measured before and immediately after the gait test, and blood samples were used for hemogasometric and laboratory analyses. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used in the statistical analysis, assigning statistical significance for values of (p ≤.05). Physical effort significantly affected HR (p ≤.027), temperature (T) (p ≤.028), oxygen pressure (pO2) (p ≤.027), oxygen saturation (sO2) (p ≤.046), calcium (Ca2+) (p ≤.046), and glucose levels (GLI) (p ≤.028). The heart rate, temperature, and pO2, sO2, Ca2+, and glucose levels were affected by exercise. There was no considerable dehydration in these horses, making it clear that, at this level of effort, they did not enter a state of, indicating that the animals, even young horses, were well conditioned to the submaximal effort required in gaiting tests. The horses showed good adaptation to exercise and did not enter a state of fatigue with the effort made, indicating that the animals in this study received adequate training and could perform the type of exercise proposed, characterized by a submaximal effort. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: The field of veterinary medicine lacks information on equine thermal hoof printing, and few data on the same subject are available in dogs. In human medicine, thermography is used to detect heat emitted by the foot when it comes in contact with a flat surface to detect the abnormalities of the foot balance. The hypothesis states that the thermal pattern of the hoof print in Warmblood horses is detectable and it does not vary among the four limbs in leisure and cross-country Warmblood horses in terms of mean temperature of the hoof print surface. A pilot study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of thermography in temperature detection of the hoof print and to investigate the occurrence of possible differences in the mean value of six selected areas and whether there are any differences in the mean temperature of the hoof print between leisure and cross-country Warmblood horses. Methods: The study included sixty non-lame Warmblood horses with all limbs taken into consideration (n = 240). The selection criteria for the horses were: no alterations in posture and no muscle group asymmetry during visual examination, no lateral or medial deviation of the carpus or hock, no reaction to the flexion tests, negative reactions to the hoof tester, no lameness during walking, trotting or lunging, no anti-inflammatory medication in the last three weeks prior to examination and rectal temperature between 37 °C and 38 °C. The hoof print of each hoof was measured with the horse in the standing position, all four limbs on the ground, using a FLIR E50 thermal camera. Six areas of temperature from the hoof print were taken into consideration, and for each of them, the mean value was identified using FLIR Tools software for photo interpretation. The One-Way ANOVA test was used to test the differences between the mean temperatures obtained for each selected area from all limbs and to compare the hoof print temperature values between the leisure horses and cross-country horses. Data were statistically processed using SAS Studio. Results: Thermography can detect the temperature emitted by the hoof but the thermal patterns of the hoof print show no difference for all four studied limbs. No significant statistical differences were noticed between the mean temperatures identified for each studied area. Also, there were no statistical differences between the mean temperature of the selected areas from the forelimbs and hindlimbs from the horses used for leisure and those used for cross-country. Based on this aspect, the mean temperature of one selected area can be determined in any of the four limbs, without visible variations. Conclusions: Thermography can detect the hoof print on a flat surface and the mean temperature for each studied area can be proposed as a reference temperature value. There were no differences in the mean temperature of the hoofprint between leisure and cross-country Warmblood Horses. Further investigations are required to clarify whether there are any differences in the thermal pattern of hoof prints from other breeds or from horses with musculoskeletal conditions. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: During husbandry, domestic animals are exposed to many factors that can influence their circadian physiology organization leading to an increase in animals’ discomfort. Thermal homeostasis is at the basis of animal wellness, the aim of the present study was to investigate the daily fluctuation of serum concentrations of 3,5,3’-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in association with the daily fluctuation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and clock gene Per2 in healthy horses housed in individual box, to improve the knowledge on this matter. Seven clinically healthy female Italian Saddle horses (8–10 years old, 510 ± 32 kg), were housed in individual boxes under natural photoperiod and environmental temperature and humidity. Blood samples were collected at 4-hour intervals over a 48-hour period, for the assessment of T3, T4, UCP1, and clock gene Per2. The application of two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on raw data showed a statistically significant effect of time of day on all studied parameters. A robust daily rhythm of T3, T4, and Per2 was observed. T3 showed a diurnal rhythm, with the acrophase at about 5 hours after sunrise, T4 acrophase was observed in the middle of the scotophase, Per2 acrophase was observed close to sunrise. In conclusion, we can claim that in horses kept under natural environmental conditions and not subjected to thermal stress, there is a daily rhythm of thyroid hormones associated with a daily rhythm of Per2 expression in the peripheral blood, and UCP1 remained constant during the two days. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Glanders is the oldest and very contagious disease among horses caused by Burkholderia mallei. The disease occurs as a chronic form in horses. Hence, because of the prolonged shedding, numerous horses can potentially get infected by one horse with glanders. Glanders is endemic in Iran and this causes occasional occurrence in horse population of the country. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of B.mallei infection in horses in two central provinces of Iran. A total of 517 serum samples were collected from stable horses in Tehran and Alborz provinces. Among the studied horses, seven presented fever, anorexia, dyspnea, subcutaneous abscesses, nasal and cutaneous discharges, emaciation, and lymphadenopathy. Nasal and ocular discharges and subcutaneous abscesses were sampled for bacterial culture and PCR. The sera were examined by means of complement fixation test (CFT) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Seropositive cases were further examined by Mallein test. The results derived from the present study indicated that only 1.35% of the studied horses were positive in CFT, iELISA and Mallein test, of which only in 42.85% B.mallei was successfully cultured on blood agar and glycerinated nutrient media and confirmed by PCR. Periodic serological tests along with quarantine can benefit reduction of the occurrence of the disease in horses in Iran. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Theileria equi is a tick-borne intracellular apicomplexan protozoan parasite that causes equine theileriosis (ET). ET is an economically important disease with a worldwide distribution that significantly impacts international horse movement. Horses are an essential part of the economy in Xinjiang which is home to ∼10% of all the horses in China. However, there is very limited information on the prevalence and genetic complexity of T. equi in this region. Blood samples from 302 horses were collected from May to September 2021 in Ili, Xinjiang, and subjected to PCR examination for the presence of T. equi. In addition, a Bayesian latent class model was employed to estimate the true prevalence of T. equi, and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the 18S rRNA gene of T. equi isolates. Seventy-two horses (23.8%) were PCR positive. After accounting for the imperfect PCR test using a Bayesian latent class model, the estimated true prevalence differed considerably between age groups, being 10.8% (95%CrI: 5.8% - 17.9%) in ≤ 3-year-old horses and 35.7% (95%CrI: 28.1% - 44.5%) in horses that were > 3 year-old. All T. equi isolates had their 18S rRNA gene (430bp) sequenced and analyzed in order to identify whether there were multiple genotypes of T. equi in the Xinjiang horse population. All of the 18S rRNA genes clustered into one phylogenetic group, clade E, which is thus probably the dominant genotype of T. equi in Xinjiang, China. To summarize, we monitored the prevalence of T. equi in horses of Xinjiang, China, with a focus on the association between age and the occurrence of T. equi by Bayesian modelling, accompanied by the genotyping of T. equi isolates. Obtaining the information on genotypes and age structure is significant in monitoring the spread of T. equi and studying the factors responsible for the distribution. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: We present here the use of targeted, long-read sequencing of the myostatin (MSTN) gene as a model to detect potential gene editing events in Thoroughbred horses. MSTN is a negative regulator of muscle development, making the gene a prime candidate target for gene doping. By sequencing the complete gene in one PCR product, we can catalogue all mutations without the need to produce short-fragment libraries. A panel of reference material fragments with defined mutations was constructed and successfully sequenced by both Oxford Nanopore and Illumina-based methods, showing that gene doping editing events can be detected using this technology. To ascertain the normal variation within the population, we sequenced the MSTN gene in 119 UK Thoroughbred horses. Variants from the reference genome were assigned to haplotypes and eight distinct patterns, designated Hap1 (reference genome) to Hap8, were determined with haplotypes Hap2 and Hap3 (which includes the ‘speed gene’ variant) being far the most prevalent. Hap3 was most abundant in flat-racing horses, whereas Hap2 was most abundant in jump-racing. Within this data set, results for 105 racehorses from out-of-competition sampling were compared between matrices of extracted DNA and direct PCR of whole blood from lithium heparin gel tubes, and strong agreement was found between the two methods. The direct-blood PCR was achieved without compromising the sample prior to plasma separation for analytical chemistry, and could thus be used as part of a routine screening workflow for gene editing detection. © 2023 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.

ABSTRACT: Przewalski horses are considered the last living population of wild horses, however, they are secondarily feral offspring of herds domesticated ~ 5000 years ago by the Botai culture. After Przewalski horses were almost extinct at the beginning of the twentieth century, their population is about 2500 individuals worldwide, with one of the largest breeding centers in Askania-Nova Biosphere Reserve (Ukraine). The research aimed to establish the maternal variation of Przewalski horses population maintained in Askania-Nova Reserve based on mitochondrial DNA hypervariable 1 and hypervariable 2 regions profiling, as well as, analysis of Y chromosome single nucleotide polymorphism unique for Przewalski horses, and coat color markers: MC1R and TBX3. The mtDNA hypervariable regions analysis in 23 Przewalski horses allowed assigning them to three distinctly different haplotypes, showing the greatest similarity to the Equus caballus reference, the Equus przewalskii reference, and to extinct species—Haringtonhippus. The Y chromosome analysis using fluorescently labelled assays differentiated horses in terms of polymorphism (g731821T>C) characteristic of Equus przewalskii. All male individuals presented genotype C characteristics for Przewalski horses. The polymorphisms within the coat color genes indicated only native, wild genotypes. The Y chromosome and coat color analysis denied admixtures of the tested horses with other Equidae. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Ticks are obligatory hematophagous ectoparasites that transmit pathogens among various vertebrates, including humans. The microbial and viral communities of ticks, including pathogenic microorganisms, are known to be highly diverse. However, the factors driving this diversity are not well understood. The tropical horse tick, Dermacentor nitens, is distributed throughout the Americas and it is recognized as a natural vector of Babesia caballi and Theileria equi, the causal agents of equine piroplasmosis. In this study, we characterized the bacterial and viral communities associated with partially fed Dermacentor nitens females collected using a passive survey on horses from field sites representing three distinct geographical areas in the country of Colombia (Bolivar, Antioquia, and Cordoba). RNA-seq and sequencing of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were performed using the Illumina-Miseq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 356 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, in which the presumed endosymbiont, Francisellaceae/Francisella spp., was predominantly found. Nine contigs corresponding to six different viruses were identified in three viral families: Chuviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Flaviviridae. Differences in the relative abundance of the microbial composition among the geographical regions were found to be independent of the presence of Francisella-like endosymbiont (FLE). The most prevalent bacteria found in each region were Corynebacterium in Bolivar, Staphylococcus in Antioquia, and Pseudomonas in Cordoba. Rickettsia-like endosymbionts, mainly recognized as the etiological agent of rickettsioses in Colombia, were detected in the Cordoba samples. Metatranscriptomics revealed 13 contigs containing FLE genes, suggesting a trend of regional differences. These findings suggest regional distinctions among the ticks and their bacterial compositions. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Steroid-hormone concentrations from non-invasively obtained biomarkers, like hair, can provide a representation of circulating hormones diffused over relatively long time periods (e.g., weeks or months). The hormone cortisol is often associated with physiological or even psychological stress, while testosterone is strongly associated with male development and reproductive success. Increasingly, studies are using hormone levels derived from hair to make inferences among both domestic animals and wildlife. For horses, all previous hair hormone analysis has been done on companion or working animals. We evaluated the levels of hair cortisol (n = 153) and testosterone (n = 48) from 136 feral horses living on Sable Island, Canada that have been part of a long-term individual-based study since 2008. This population has been undisturbed and unmanaged for over 50 years, and exhibits the natural social organization for horses, harem defense polygyny. Hair samples were collected in mid to late summer and the segment analyzed corresponds with hair grown during, and following, the peak of the reproductive season. Social position was determined based on the male’s role as either a dominant breeding Stallion (Stallion), a non-breeding subordinate male (tag), adult Bachelor (5 years old or older), or Immature male (2–4 years of age). While there was no difference in hair-cortisol concentration among any class of adult males (i.e., Stallion, tag, or Bachelor), Immature males had significantly lower hair cortisol concentrations than the other groups (p = 0.001). Hair testosterone levels among the four social positions were significantly higher among Stallions (p = 0.04). Hair testosterone concentration was also significantly related to the probability of a male being either a Bachelor or Stallion and was the only variable remaining in AICc model selection (p = 0.016, AICc = 32.3, Null AICc = 38.8). While not a significant relationship, Stallions had a negative correlation between hair cortisol concentrations and testosterone (R2 = −0.20, p = 0.383), and Bachelors, conversely, had a positive association (R2 = 0.43, p = 0.246). Our observations of hormone concentrations in relation to physiological, social, or reproductive parameters in this population suggest trends that are similar to what has been established using blood or other matrices. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Synbiotics are often provided to horses receiving antibiotics to protect against microbiome disturbances, despite a lack of evidence for efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a synbiotic product in horses receiving antibiotics. Sixteen actively racing Standardbred horses were randomly allocated (four-way crossover) to one of four groups: antibiotics (10 days; AB), synbiotics (28 days; PROBIOPlusTM; PBP), PBP + AB, or Control. The fecal microbiome was investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing, and fecal dry matter (DM; %), pH, and scores (FS; 0–9) were measured. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA. Results found microbiota differences in community membership between PBP + AB and all other treatments during and after antibiotic treatment. During antibiotic treatment, AB and PBP + AB were significantly different from Control. After antibiotic treatment, PBP + AB was significantly different from all other treatments. The few differences found in relative abundance of phyla or predominant genera were mostly in fiber degrading bacteria. The Fibrobacter population was significantly higher in AB and PBP + AB horses than Control. Unclassified Ruminococcaceae was significantly higher in Control than AB and PBP. After antibiotic treatment, PBP + AB horses were significantly higher than PBP horses. In conclusion, these data provide support for the ability of PROBIOPlus™ to maintain healthy gastrointestinal microbiome during antibiotic treatment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to compare the extent of inflammation response in the middle carpal joints of healthy horses following intra-articular injection of 2% lidocaine, 0.5% bupivacaine, or 0.9% saline solution. The right middle carpal joint of 20 horses was injected with 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (GB, n = 10) or 5 mL of 2% lidocaine (GL, n = 10). The left middle carpal joint of horses was used as a control (5 mL 0.9% saline). Serum and synovial fluid (SF) were aseptically collected before and at predetermined times after each injection. Serum and synovial fluid protein, albumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, α1-antitripsin, and α1-acid glycoprotein concentrations were measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and compared among treatments. The results were submitted to analysis of variance using the SAS statistical program, and means were compared by the Student–Newman–Keuls test (P <.05). Both lidocaine and bupivacaine induced serum and SF changes indicative of inflammation, but the magnitude of those changes was more pronounced for lidocaine. Administration of 0.9% saline also induced an inflammatory reaction, but the magnitude of these changes was less pronounced than those caused by GB and GL. The results suggested that bupivacaine is safer than lidocaine for intra-articular injection in horses. Saline solution should not be used as an adjunct to intra-articular injections in horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Vitamin D deficiency is common in humans and is increasingly linked to the pathogenesis of a multitude of diseases including obesity and metabolic syndrome. The biology of vitamin D in horses is poorly described; the relative contribution of the diet and skin synthesis to circulating concentrations is unclear and associations with the endocrine disease have not been explored. Objectives: To determine the relationship between management, season and endocrine disease and vitamin D status in horses. Study design: Cross-sectional cohort study. Methods: Plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25(OH)D2) and D3 (25(OH)D3) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 34 healthy unsupplemented grazing ponies and 22 stabled Thoroughbreds receiving supplementary vitamin D3 in feed. A nested group of 18 grazing ponies were sampled on long and short days (>12 and <12 h of light/day) to determine the effect of sunlight exposure. In addition, the relationships between age, sex, adiposity, serum insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone and vitamin D status were assessed in a mixed group of 107 horses using a linear regression model. Results: All animals had a measurable level of 25(OH)D2 (median 10.7 nmol/L) whilst 25(OH)D3 was only detected in Thoroughbreds receiving D3 supplementation. Thoroughbreds had lower concentrations of 25(OH)D2 than ponies (7.4 vs. 12.6 nmol/L, p < 0.01). In grazing ponies, 25(OH)D2 concentrations were significantly higher on long days compared to short days (14.4 vs. 8.7 nmol/L, p < 0.01), whilst 25(OH)D3 was undetectable. Measures of increased adiposity, but not basal insulin, were associated with higher 25(OH)D2 concentrations, conversely to humans. Increasing ACTH was associated with lower 25(OH)D2 (p < 0.01). Main limitations: Vitamin D2 concentrations were not measured in grass or forage. Conclusions: In horses 25(OH)D2 is the predominant vitamin D metabolite, and there is an apparent lack of endogenous vitamin D3 production. The relationship between vitamin D and endocrine disorders in horses does not reflect that of other species and warrants further investigation. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Back pain in horses, regardless of the underlying cause, is a common condition that can result in poor performance. The field veterinarian has limited noninvasive treatment options for reduction in back muscle soreness. This study was designed to evaluate effectiveness of a commercially available herbal, nonheating liniment (Sore No More Performance Ultra, Arenus), in reducing pain and inflammation in horses with mild back pain. Objectives: Focus on a standardised area of the lumbar back region to evaluate effects of an herbal liniment over 44 days using pressure algometry to determine pain response and thermographic measurement of surface temperature to evaluate inflammation. Study design: A randomised complete block design was used. Eighteen mature stock horses were evaluated for back pain and randomly assigned to treatment group (herbal liniment or control solution). Methods: All horses maintained similar light work 5 days per week in a university equestrian programme for 44 days. Evaluation of the back was standardised by identifying the lumbar region, and pain and inflammation assessed weekly with force gauge pressure readings and thermal images. Results: All horses displayed a decrease in pain scores over the first 3 weeks of the study, but the control group saw a rise in pain scores at Day 23. Pain scores on the left side of the back were significantly lower in the liniment group than the control group at Day 30. Main limitations: Number of horses available for the study was limited. Daily exercise of the horses used represented typical use of mature lesson horses, however, was not standardised for the entirety of the 44-day trial. Conclusions: Standardised evaluation procedures using pressure algometry and thermography found that Sore No More Performance Ultra herbal liniment had some effect on thermography (inflammation) and pain response of the back, with improvements shown at 23–30 days. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Equine ingesta-associated choledocholithiasis is a rare cause of morbidity and mortality. We describe here the clinical, gross, histologic, and microbiologic features of this condition in 2 horses and compare the features to 2 previous cases. Case 1 was a 4-y-old Thoroughbred mare with colic. Case 2 was an 18-y-old American Paint Horse mare with colic, chronic weight loss, and inappropriate mentation. Both had elevated biochemical markers of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis and were euthanized given a poor prognosis. Case 1 had a well-formed 5-cm choledocholith surrounding a piece of hay, and had chronic neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis, bridging fibrosis, and extrahepatic obstruction. Case 2 had an ill-formed choledocholith with occasional hay fragments, wood stick, and twigs, and had regionally extensive hepatocellular necrosis with mild neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis and bridging fibrosis. Enterococcus casseliflavus and Escherichia coli were isolated in both cases; Clostridium spp. were also isolated from case 2. All 4 reported cases had increased activity of cholestatic enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, portal inflammation, and bridging fibrosis. Colic, pyrexia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and elevated hepatocellular enzyme activity were documented in 3 cases. Foreign material in all 4 cases was plant origin (choledochophytolithiasis), including hay (n = 2), sticks/twigs (n = 2), and grass awns (n = 1). Ingesta-associated choledocholithiasis may be considered as a cause of colic, pyrexia, and elevated cholestatic biomarkers in horses. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chlamydiae are reported to cause abortion in several species, however the association between Chlamydia sp. and equine abortions is poorly understood. A zoonotic transfer event of C. psittaci from aborted equine tissues in Australia has emphasized the need to better understand the prevalence of this pathogen in equine populations. The prevalence of chlamydia in equine abortions in North America has not been investigated thoroughly. We examined 99 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded placental samples submitted between 2009 and 2020 from equine abortions in Western Canada using chlamydia-specific 16S rRNA conventional PCR testing; 26 of 99 submissions tested positive for chlamydial DNA. Most of these submissions (n = 17) had no final diagnosis noted on their original pathology reports. DNA sequencing identified 22 of the 26 cases as C. abortus; 21 of the 22 C. abortus–positive samples were positive on chlamydial immunohistochemistry. These findings contrast with studies in Europe that found a low prevalence of chlamydiae using similar methodology. The high prevalence of the potentially zoonotic C. abortus identified in our study suggests that more substantial biosecurity protocols may be warranted for equine foaling, abortion, and stillbirth in Western Canada to prevent zoonotic transfer of the pathogen. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The g.66493737C/T polymorphism of the myostatin gene (MSTN) majorly influences muscle fiber composition and best race distance of Thoroughbreds. Thus, a better understanding of this process may lead to superior genetic exploitation for maximizing Thoroughbred athletic potential. Our objective is to investigate whether myostatin genotypes are associated with muscular development and cardiac variables of Thoroughbreds. Echocardiography and muscular ultrasonography were performed on three groups having C/C, C/T, and T/T genotypes, respectively. Each group consisted of 22 animals. Homogeneity of variance between the groups was checked by Levene's test. Multivariate analysis of variance was applied to determine differences in measured variables vs. MSTN genotypes. Fascicle length of anconeus and thickness of triceps brachii muscles showed significant differences between C/C and T/T genotypes (pFascicle-length-of-anconeus = 0.004, pthickness-of-triceps-brachii < 0.001). According to the primary outcome, there are associations between myostatin genotypes and cardiac variables. Aortic diameter at the sinus of Valsalva (end-diastole and end-systole) and aortic diameter at the valve (end-systole) indicated significant differences between C/C and T/T genotypes (paortic-diameter-at-the-sinus-of-Valsalva-end-diastole = 0.015, paortic-diameter-at-the-sinus-of-Valsalva-end-systole = 0.011, paortic-diameter-at-the-valve-end-systole = 0.014). Pearson correlation effect sizes were rFascicle-length-of-anconeus = 0.460, rthickness-of-triceps-brachii = 0.590, raortic-diameter-at-the-sinus-of-Valsalva-end-diastole = 0.423, raortic-diameter-at-the-sinus-of-Valsalva-end-systole = 0.450, and raortic-diameter-at-the-valve-end-systole = 0.462. C/C genotypes gave 22.1, 12.2, 6.3, 6.0, and 6.7% higher values compared to T/T genotypes, respectively. Differences regarding aortic diameter between genotype groups support the hypothesis that C/C animals have consequently increased cardiac output and aerobic capacity. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: In recent years, the mare's milk has been introduced as a rich source of nutrients with hypoallergic characteristics which is widely used for Iranian infants. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the heavy metal concentration of mare's milk and its consumption risk assessment. Methods: About 88 mare's milk was collected from Yazd, the centre of Iran, during the summer of 2020. The raw mare's milk was digested and analysed for mineral and heavy metal content (As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb and Zn) by ICP-OES. To estimate the health hazard for consumers the Estimated Daily Intake (EDI), Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Hazard Index (HI) of heavy metals were determined. Results: The Ca ranged from 260.52 to 201.43 mg/L, which was the highest mineral in mare's milk followed by P and Mg. By increasing the age, P and Ca content was increased. The obtained ranges of Cu, Co, Fe, Mn and Zn were 72.12–75.11, 1.12–9.3, 180.69–230.21, 31.24–47.13 and 1060–1200 μg/L, respectively. The Cd and Arsenic content of mares' 8–11 years of age had higher concentrations. The highest Pb content was reported in mares 4–7 years old (10 μg/L). Although, Pb, Cd and As content of the mare's milk was evaluated lower than the permissible limit. Also, the HQ value was As > Cd > Pb > Zn > Ni > Cu for infants, toddlers and adults. The HI of mare's milk was 0.16, 0.15 and 0.022 for infants, toddlers and adults, respectively. Conclusions: Mare's milk could be an effective nutrition source for infants and children suffering from milk protein allergies. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Case reports demonstrating a return to sinus rhythm from sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) are limited. VT is uncommon in horses but can be life threatening and has been reported in horses with primary gastrointestinal disease. Treatment is recommended if there is poor perfusion, if heart rate exceeds 100 beats/min, if multiform/polymorphic complexes or torsades des pointes is present. Lidocaine or magnesium sulfate is the first-line medication. In this case, a 19-year-old Warmblood gelding with a history of exploratory laparotomy presented with an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm and heart rate of 80 beats/min. ECG demonstrated VT with a heart rate of 75 beats/min. As the horse was already receiving a lidocaine bolus, the VT was treated with multiple boluses of intravenous magnesium sulfate over a period of several hours. This converted the VT to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with heart rate of 44 beats/min and the horse remained in NSR until discharge 8 days later. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Assessment protocols to describe the various aspects of conformation, gait and jumping traits on a linear scale were introduced at young horse tests for Swedish Warmblood horses in 2013. The traits scored on a linear scale are assumed to be less subjective and more easily compared across populations than the traditional evaluated traits that are scored relative to the breeding goal. However, the resulting number of traits is considerable, and several of the traits are correlated. The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationship between the different evaluated and linearly scored traits in Swedish Warmbloods using factor analysis. In total, 20,935 horses born 1996–2017 had information on evaluated traits, and 5450 of these also had linearly scored trait records assessed since 2014 when the protocol was updated. A factor analysis with varimax rotation was performed separately for evaluated and linearly scored traits using the Psych package in R. Height at withers was included in both analyses. A total of four factors for evaluated traits and 14 factors for linearly scored traits were kept for further analysis. Missing values for individual traits in horses with linearly scored trait records were imputed based on correlated traits before factor scores were calculated using factor loadings. Genetic parameters for, and correlations between, the resulting underlying factors were estimated using multiple-trait animal models in the BLUPF90 package. Heritability estimates were on a similar level as for the traits currently used in the genetic evaluation, ranging from 0.05 for the factor for linearly scored traits named L.behaviour (dominated by traits related to behaviour) to 0.59 for the factor for evaluated traits named E.size (dominated by height at withers and conformation). For both types of traits, separate factors were formed for jumping and gait traits, as well as for body size. High genetic correlations were estimated between such corresponding factors for evaluated traits and factors for linearly scored traits. In conclusion, factor analysis could be used to reduce the number of traits to be included in multiple-trait genetic evaluation or in genomic analysis for warmblood horses. It can also contribute to a better understanding of the interrelationships among the assessed traits and be useful to decide on subgroups of traits to be used in several multiple-trait evaluations on groups of original traits. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The treatment of saturated horse beds before they arrive at their final destination is necessary to avoid the risk of animal and environmental contamination. For this purpose, the composting process has great functionality due its to low cost, effectiveness, and operational ease. However, because of the nature of the materials used, this process can be long, and it is necessary to improve it to optimize composting cycles. This work aimed to isolate and identify fungi present in the compost piles of saturated equine bedding made with shavings and rice straw, identifying those with the greatest potential for cellulase production. Using specific cellulolytic media containing shavings or rice straw, seven strains were isolated. The total cellulase enzymatic activity of the isolates from the beds made with shavings was lower than that obtained from rice straw beds. Four strains showed high enzymatic potential for use in the shavings substrate (MA -6 2 f1, MA -6 2 f2, MA -7 9, and MA -7 10) and three for the rice straw substrate (PA -7 5, PA -7 7, and PA -7 10). The isolate PA -7 5 reached 0.376 IU mL−1, the best index among all the isolates. These isolates were identified as belonging to the Aspergillus fumigatus species. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Stabled horses often experience negative emotions due to the inappropriate living conditions imposed by humans. However, identifying what emotions horses experience and what can trigger positive and negative emotions in stabled horses can be challenging. In this article we present a brief history of the study of emotions and models that explain emotions from a scientific point of view and the physiological bases and functions of emotions. We then review and discuss physiological and behavioral indicators and cognitive bias tests developed to assess emotions in horses. Hormone concentrations, body temperature, the position of the ears, facial expressions and behaviors, such as approach and avoidance behaviors, can provide valuable information about emotional states in horses. The cognitive bias paradigm is a recent and robust tool to assess emotions in horses. Knowing how to evaluate the intensity and frequency of an individual's emotions can guide horse owners and caretakers to identify practices and activities that should be stimulated, avoided or even banned from the individual's life, in favor of a life worth living. The development and validation of novel indicators of emotions considering positive and negative contexts can help in these actions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Current legislation in the United Kingdom stipulates that horses should not be slaughtered within sight of one another. However, abattoir personnel anecdotally report that, for semi-feral horses unused to restraint, co-slaughtering alongside a conspecific could reduce distress through social buffering and improve safety, but there is a lack of evidence to support this. CCTV footage from an English abattoir was assessed retrospectively with welfare indicators from when horses entered the kill pen until they were killed. Of 256 horses analysed, 12% (32/256) were co-slaughtered (alongside a conspecific) and 88% (224/256) individually. Co-slaughtered horses moved more in the pen, but individually slaughtered horses showed more agitated behaviour, required more encouragement to enter the kill pen, and experienced more slips or falls. Unrestrained horses (40%; 102/256) showed increased agitation, movement, and agonistic behaviour towards the operator and resisted entry to the kill pen compared to restrained horses (60%; 154/256). Positive interactions between conspecifics were seen in 94% (30/32) of co-slaughtered horses, and only 6% (1/16) showed a startled response to the first horse being shot, with a median time of 15 s between shots. This study highlights the impact that both conspecific and human interactions can have on equine welfare at slaughter. Semi-feral or unrestrained horses appear to experience increased distress compared to horses more familiar with human handling, and the presence of a conspecific at slaughter mitigated this. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is limited evidence regarding the treatment and outcomes of larval cyathostominosis. Objectives: To describe the presentation, treatment and outcomes of horses with larval cyathostominosis in two equine hospitals. Study design: Retrospective, multicentred cohort study. Methods: Clinical records were reviewed (2009–2020). Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of larval cyathostominosis (determined by faecal assessment and/or post-mortem examination). Data were assessed for normality. Descriptive analysis was performed for frequency results and central tendencies. Statistical analysis between survivors and nonsurvivors was determined by Chi-square/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and Student's t-test/Mann–Whitney for continuous variables. Results: Of 38 cases, 21 (55%) were nonsurvivors (3/38 dead on arrival). Nonsurvivors died by 2.9 days ± 2.4. Tachycardia (mean 61 beats/min ± 14), leucocytosis (mean 17.1 × 109/L ± 9.1), neutrophilia (mean 14.1 × 109/L ± 8.5), hypoalbuminaemia (mean 21.6 g/L ± 6.0), hyperfibrinogenaemia (mean 7.4 g/L ± 2.6) and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA) (median 315.0 mg/L, interquartile range [IQR] 117.0–1460.0) were consistent findings. Faecal shedding of Salmonella spp. occurred in four cases. The mean last recorded albumin was 18.6 g/L ± 4.5 and total protein (TP) 52.3 g/L ± 13.6. Crystalloids were administered in 25/35, synthetic colloids in 5/35 and plasma in 17/35 cases. Anthelmintic treatment was administered in 25/35 cases, of which 22 also received corticosteroids. Recumbency prior to admission (p = 0.037) and administration of isotonic fluid therapy (p = 0.027) were associated with nonsurvival. From peripheral blood analysis, lower TP (p = 0.006) and higher SAA (p = 0.050) concentrations at admission as well as lower last recorded TP (p = 0.002) and lower last recorded albumin concentrations (p = 0.028) were associated with nonsurvival. Main limitations: Results may not be applicable to other populations. Conclusions: Referred cases of larval cyathostominosis have a low survival rate. Several variables are associated with reduced survival: history of recumbency, isotonic fluid therapy, elevated SAA at admission, low TP at admission, low last recorded TP and low last recorded albumin. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Rebound gastric hyperacidity (RGH) secondary to hypergastrinemia has been suggested to contribute to the rapid recurrence of equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) in horses after discontinuation of omeprazole. Hypothesis/Objectives: To evaluate changes in serum gastrin and chromogranin A (CgA) concentrations in response to medium-term (57-day) omeprazole treatment and after omeprazole discontinuation. Animals: Fourteen mature Thoroughbred racehorses in simulated race training. Methods: Horses received 2.28 g of oral omeprazole PO q24h for 57 days within a 61-day period, excluding a withholding period applied mid-protocol during which treatment was stopped as part of a concurrent study. Serum samples were collected on day 0 before omeprazole treatment, on day 1 of each week of the treatment period, and for an additional 5 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Serum gastrin and CgA concentrations were analyzed using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ELISA, respectively. Results: Median serum gastrin concentrations increased 2.5-fold from baseline to day 7 (P <.001) but did not increase further during the omeprazole treatment period. Median serum gastrin concentrations returned to baseline within 2 to 4 days after administration of the last dose of omeprazole. No effect of treatment or discontinuation was seen in serum CgA concentrations. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Serum gastrin concentrations increased in response to omeprazole treatment but returned to baseline within 2 to 4 days after the last dose of omeprazole. No effect of treatment or discontinuation was seen in serum CgA concentrations. Our results do not support the use of tapering protocols in horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Indigenous Iranian horse breeds were evolutionarily affected by natural and artificial selection in distinct phylogeographic clades, which shaped their genomes in several unique ways. The aims of this study were to evaluate the genetic diversity and genomewide selection signatures in four indigenous Iranian horse breeds. We evaluated 169 horses from Caspian (n = 21), Turkmen (n = 29), Kurdish (n = 67), and Persian Arabian (n = 52) populations, using genomewide genotyping data. The contemporary effective population sizes were 59, 98, 102, and 113 for Turkmen, Caspian, Persian Arabian, and Kurdish breeds, respectively. By analysis of the population genetic structure, we classified the north breeds (Caspian and Turkmen) and west/southwest breeds (Persian Arabian and Kurdish) into two phylogeographic clades reflecting their geographic origin. Using the de-correlated composite of multiple selection signal statistics based on pairwise comparisons, we detected a different number of significant SNPs under putative selection from 13 to 28 for the six pairwise comparisons (FDR < 0.05). The identified SNPs under putative selection coincided with genes previously associated with known QTLs for morphological, adaptation, and fitness traits. Our results showed HMGA2 and LLPH as strong candidate genes for height variation between Caspian horses with a small size and the other studied breeds with a medium size. Using the results of studies on human height retrieved from the GWAS catalog, we suggested 38 new putative candidate genes under selection. These results provide a genomewide map of selection signatures in the studied breeds, which represent valuable information for formulating genetic conservation and improved breeding strategies for the breeds. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Central North Carolina (NC) is highly contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in part due to local fluorochemical production. Little is known about the exposure profiles and long-term health impacts for humans and animals that live in nearby communities. In this study, serum PFAS concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry and diagnostic clinical chemistry endpoints were assessed for 31 dogs and 32 horses that reside in Gray’s Creek NC at households with documented PFAS contamination in their drinking water. PFAS were detected in every sample, with 12 of the 20 PFAS detected in ≥50% of samples from each species. The average total PFAS concentrations in horses were lower compared to dogs who had higher concentrations of PFOS (dogs 2.9 ng/mL; horses 1.8 ng/mL), PFHxS (dogs 1.43 ng/mL, horses < LOD), and PFOA (dogs 0.37 ng/mL; horses 0.10 ng/mL). Regression analysis highlighted alkaline phosphatase, glucose, and globulin proteins in dogs and gamma glutamyl transferase in horses as potential biomarkers associated with PFAS exposure. Overall, the results of this study support the utility of companion animal and livestock species as sentinels of PFAS exposure differences inside and outside of the home. As in humans, renal and hepatic health in domestic animals may be sensitive to long-term PFAS exposures. © 2023 American Chemical Society

ABSTRACT: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of helminths in Thoroughbred horses in Rio de Janeiro; make correlations with risk factors for these infections; and compare the efficiency of three floatation solutions applied in the quantitative Mini-FLOTAC technique. Fecal samples from 520 horses were collected from six training centers between 2019 and 2021. These were subjected to the Mini-FLOTAC technique using three solutions: NaCl (density = 1.200 g/mL), ZnSO4 (1.350 g/mL) and ZnSO4 (1.200 g/mL); and also to qualitative techniques. Information on the horses’ sex and age of horses was retrieved from the studbook; data on management from a questionnaire. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 71.9%, with significant differences between training centers (P ≤ .05). On farm C, 87.7% of the samples presented strongylids and 38.7% had Parascaris spp., with the highest egg counts per gram of feces (EPG), of 358.33 and 40.41 respectively. Horses less than 3 years of age were about eight times more likely to be parasitized by strongylids and eleven times more likely to have EPG ≥500. The NaCl solution used in Mini-FLOTAC enabled recovery of the greatest number of samples with high EPG and reached the highest sensitivity values in the diagnosis when compared to the other solutions. Moreover, in the diagnoses, the levels of agreement between the results from the solutions used in Mini-FLOTAC were substantial. However, in estimating the EPG, full agreement between the results from the solutions used in Mini-FLOTAC was not obtained. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The use of 2-dimensional representations (e.g. photographs or digital images) of real-life physical objects has been an important tool in studies of animal cognition. Horses are reported to recognise objects and individuals (conspecifics and humans) from printed photographs, but it is unclear whether image recognition is also true for digital images, e.g. computer projections. We expected that horses trained to discriminate between two real-life objects would show the same learnt response to digital images of these objects indicating that the images were perceived as objects, or representations of such. Riding-school horses (N = 27) learnt to touch one of two objects (target object counterbalanced between horses) to instantly receive a food reward. After discrimination learning (three consecutive sessions of 8/10 correct trials), horses were immediately tested with on-screen images of the objects over 10 image trials interspersed with five real object trials. At first image presentation, all but two horses spontaneously responded to the images with the learnt behaviour by contacting one of the two images, but the number of horses touching the correct image was not different from chance (14/27 horses, p > 0.05). Only one horse touched the correct image above chance level across 10 image trials (9/10 correct responses, p = 0.021). Our findings thus question whether horses recognise real-life objects from digital images. We discuss how methodological factors and individual differences (i.e. age, welfare state) might have influenced animals’ response to the images, and the importance of validating the suitability of stimuli of this kind for cognitive studies in horses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Caudal cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis (CAPJ OA) leads to career-altering clinical signs in the horse. Oblique radiographs and standing cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) facilitate the assessment of this area, however, the variability of interpretation of these images is currently unknown. This retrospective, secondary analysis, methods comparison study investigated interobserver agreement between clinicians and modality in grades of CAPJ OA on lateral and oblique radiographs and CBCT. We hypothesized that agreement between clinicians’ grades of CAPJ OA would be lowest for oblique radiographs and highest for CBCT, and agreement between grades of CAPJ OA would be low for all pairs of modalities. Horses underwent lateral and oblique radiography and CBCT of the CAPJs of C5-C6 and C6-C7. Radiographs and CBCT images were graded retrospectively by four blinded clinicians using 3-point scales. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate interobserver agreement between grades of CAPJ OA, and agreement between grades of CAPJ OA between different modalities was explored using kappa-weighted analysis. Agreement between clinicians’ grades of CAPJ OA was moderate for lateral radiographs (0.49), and fair for oblique radiographs (0.23) and CBCT (0.36). For all modalities, agreement was slight to fair between clinicians for CAPJs with grade 1 (normal, 0.21–0.32) or 2 (mild, 0.13–0.36) CAPJ OA, and moderate to substantial for grade 3 (moderate to severe, 0.45–0.77) CAPJ OA. Agreement between grades of CAPJ OA was fair for all pairs of modalities. This study provides important information regarding the inconsistency of interpretation of mild CAPJ OA on radiographs and CBCT amongst clinicians. © 2023 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

ABSTRACT: Thoracoscopy pericardiotomy consists of endoscopic access to the thoracic cavity to perform the opening of the pericardial sac, described in the equine species only through the intercostal access, and there are no studies addressing the singleport transdiaphragmatic access, so the objective was to develop the pericardiotomy technique by transdiaphragmatic thoracoscopy using a single port. The technique was performed using six cadavers of adult horses, positioned in dorsal decubitus, making it possible to initiate access with an incision in the region proximal to the xiphoid process, for the introduction of an 11 mm endotip trocar, which through the diaphragm reached the thoracic cavity. After accessing the thorax, a rigid endoscope with a working portal was entered, proceeding with the introduction of endoscopic scissors, used to open the pericardium. Pericardiotomy was initiated through the phrenic-pericardial ligament. After the procedure, the corpses were sent for necropsy for evaluation of inadvertent injuries and examination of the diaphragm and pericardium. The access allowed the visualization of the structures of the caudal portion of the thorax, in addition to the visualization and manipulation of the pericardium. The mean surgical time was 24.16 ± 7.03, allowing extensive pericardiotomy. It was concluded that transdiaphragmatic thoracoscopy is an adequate procedure for the visualization and access of the pericardium, as well as the structures present in the caudal region of both hemithoraxes. Therefore, the proposed technique, pericardiotomy by thoracoscopy using a singleport transdiaphragmatic approach, was promising, proving to be a viable alternative for pericardial procedures in the equine species. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Little is known about potential differences in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (Lrln) and left cricoarytenoideus dorsalis (LCAD) muscle between domestic and feral horse populations. If a difference exists, feral horses may provide a useful control population for research related to recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) and increase our understanding of potential population pressures influencing the incidence RLN. Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the Lrln and LCAD of domestic and feral horses using histological and immunohistochemical techniques (IHC). Methods: Sixteen horses, domestic (n = 8) and feral (n = 8), without clinical or ancillary examinations that were processed at an abattoir had the Lrln and LCAD muscle harvested immediately following death. Carcass weights were recorded. Subjective and morphometric histologic assessment were performed on Lrln sections. The LCAD was assessed for myosin heavy chain (fibre type proportion, diameter and grouping using IHC. Results: Fibre-type grouping consistent with RLN was seen in both groups. Regenerating fibre clusters were more common in domestic compared to feral horses (p = 0.04). No other histologic differences occurred between groups. Muscle fibre typing demonstrated a lower mean percentage of type IIX fibres in the feral group compared to the domestic group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in type I or IIA proportions or mean diameter of any fibre type between the groups. Conclusions: The domestic population showed evidence of nerve regeneration suggesting RLN in this group, yet this was not supported by the higher proportion of type IIX muscle fibres compared to the feral population. Further evaluation to clarify the significance and wider occurrence of the differences is indicated. © 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections are increasing in human and veterinary medicine. Although horses were initially thought to be resistant to NTM infection, reports of horses suffering from gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive diseases associated with NTM have increased in the last few decades. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the mycobacteria species found in horses, describe clinical manifestations, diagnostic and treatment approaches, and public health concerns of NTM infection in horses. Clinical manifestations of NTM in horses include pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, soft tissue, bone infections, and disseminated disease. NTM are also linked to granulomatous enteritis, placentitis, and abortions. Currently, diagnostic methods for NTM are limited and include acid-fast microscopy, bacterial cultures, species-specific PCR assays, and gene sequencing. In humans, NTM treatment guidelines are available, but their application appears inadequate and inconsistent. In horses, treatment guidelines for NTM infections are not available. NTM are a serious public health threat as 70% of people with untreated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have a chronic pulmonary disease caused by NTM. Thus, it is essential that we gain a better understanding of NTM infections in horses and their zoonotic potential. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Both type 1 (PSSM1) and type 2 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM2) are characterised by aggregates of abnormal polysaccharide in skeletal muscle. Whereas the genetic basis for PSSM1 is known (R309H GYS1), the cause of PSSM2 in Quarter Horses (PSSM2-QH) is unknown and glycogen concentrations not defined. Objectives: To characterise the histopathological and biochemical features of PSSM2-QH and determine if an associated monogenic variant exists in genes known to cause glycogenosis. Study design: Retrospective case control. Methods: Sixty-four PSSM2-QH, 30 PSSM1-QH and 185 control-QH were identified from a biopsy repository and clinical data, histopathology scores (0–3), glycogen concentrations and selected glycolytic enzyme activities compared. Coding sequences of 12 genes associated with muscle glycogenoses were identified from whole genome sequences and compared between seven PSSM2-QH and five control-QH. Results: Exertional rhabdomyolysis in PSSM2-QH occurred predominantly in barrel racing and working cow/roping performance types and improved with regular exercise and a low starch/fat-supplemented diet. Histopathological scores, including the amount of amylase-resistant polysaccharide (PSSM2-QH 1.4 ± 0.6, PSSM1-QH 2.1 ± 0.3, control-QH 0 ± 0, p < 0.001), and glycogen concentrations (PSSM2-QH 129 ± 62, PSSM1-QH 175 ± 9, control-QH 80 ± 27 mmol/kg, p < 0.0001) were intermediate in PSSM2-QH with significant differences among groups. In PSSM2-QH, abnormal polysaccharide had a less filamentous ultrastructure than PSSM1-QH and phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase activities were normal. Seventeen of 30 PSSM2-QH with available pedigrees descended from one of three stallions within four generations. Of the 29 predicted high or moderate impact genetic variants identified in candidate genes, none were present in only PSSM2-QH and absent in control-QH. Main limitations: Analyses of PSSM2-QH and PSSM1-QH were performed on shipped samples, controls on frozen samples. Conclusions: PSSM2-QH is a novel glycogen storage disorder that is not the result of a mutation in genes currently known to cause muscle glycogenoses in other species. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Transportation may lead to oxidative stress (OS) and gastric ulceration in horses, and optimal feed management before, or during, transportation is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of transportation after three different feeding strategies on OS and to explore possible associations between OS and equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS). Twenty-six mares were transported by truck for 12 hours without food or water. Horses were randomly divided into 3 groups; (1) fed 1 hour before departure (BD), (2) fed 6 hours BD, (3) fed 12 hours BD. Clinical examinations and blood collections were performed at approximately 4 hours BD (T0), at unloading (T1), 8 hours (T2) and 60 hours (T3) after unloading. Gastroscopy was conducted prior to departure, and at T1 and T3. Although OS parameters remained in the normal range, transportation was associated with increased reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMS) at unloading (P=0.004), with differences between horses fed 1 hour and 12 hours BD (P < .05). The level of total antioxidant (PTAS) was affected by both transportation and feeding strategy (P = 0.019), with horses fed 1 hour BD demonstrating greater PTAS at T = 0, and a different response in comparison with the other groups and the literature. Nine horses demonstrated clinically significant ulceration of the squamous mucosa at T1 but, although weak correlations were evident between OS parameters and ulcer scores, univariate logistic regression showed no associations. This study suggests that feed management prior to a long journey (12 hours) may affect oxidative balance. Further studies are needed to understand the nexus between feed management before and during transport, transport-related OS and EGUS. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The apicomplexan hemoprotozoan Theileria equi is a tick-borne pathogen that causes disease in equids, and together with Babesia caballi, causes equine piroplasmosis (EP). Many ticks are associated with EP around the world, and in South America three species may be related: Dermacentor nitens, Amblyomma sculptum, and Rhipicephalus microplus, as they are commonly found in horses. Among the species cited above, only R. microplus is found in Rio Grande do Sul state, Southern Brazil. In addition, this state has the only area legally free of R. microplus in Brazil. This study aimed to compare the seroprevalence for T. equi on farms located in a tick-free area (23 farms, 215 horses) and a tick-infested (25 farms, 141 horses) adjacent areas, as well as to identify potential risk factors for exposure to T. equi. Blood was collected from 356 horses from both areas, and later an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect anti-T. equi antibodies. Besides the blood collection, questionnaires and interviews were conducted in an attempt to identify potential risk factors. The R. microplus-free zone had 6% seropositive horses against 70% in the tick-infested zone. Previous observation of ticks on horses of the herd increased four times the odds of a horse to be seropositive for T. equi, and by three times if ticks were observed on cattle which share paddocks with horses on the farm. The results showed a large difference in T. equi seroprevalence between tick-infested and free areas, and also emphasized the relevance of R. microplus in the epidemiology of T. equi. The study also reveals the potential of the establishment of a T. equi-free zone for horse breeding in Southern Brazil. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Botryomycosis is an uncommon chronic bacterial pyogranulomatous infection of cutaneous and, rarely of visceral origin, that can rarely invade the osseous tissues. An 8-year-old Friesian gelding was presented with severe bilateral hindlimb ataxia and paresis of 2-weeks' duration. Radiographic examination revealed a large osteolytic lesion at the T10-T11 intervertebral disc space. Post-mortem examination revealed discospondylitis with abscess formation and histological presence of pyogranulomatous inflammation with coccoform bacteria rimmed by Splendore-Hoeppli material. Staphylococcus aureus was identified by bacteriological examination. This case report describes the clinical presentation, imaging features and post-mortem findings of a Friesian gelding presenting with severe bilateral hindlimb ataxia and paresis caused by compression and degeneration of the spinal cord due to a botryomycosis-like thoracic discospondylitis. Botryomycosis-like infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal expansile bone lesions demonstrating diffuse osteolysis, sclerosis and interrupted bone margins. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been found to be widespread among different animal species worldwide. In Bulgaria, high HEV seropositivity was found among pigs (60.3%), wild boars (40.8%), and East Balkan swine (82.5%). The aim of the present study was to establish the seroprevalence of HEV among dogs, cats, horses, cattle, sheep, and goats in Bulgaria. In total, 720 serum samples from six animal species were randomly collected: dogs—90 samples; cats—90; horses—180; cattle—180; sheep—90; and goats—90. The serum samples were collected from seven districts of the country: Burgas, Kardzhali, Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Sliven, Smolyan, and Stara Zagora. The animal serum samples were tested for HEV antibodies using the commercial Wantai HEV-Ab ELISA kit (Beijing, China). The overall HEV seroprevalence among different animal species from Bulgaria was as follows: dogs—21.1%; cats—17.7%; horses—8.3%; cattle—7.7%; sheep—32.2%; and goats—24.4%. We found the lowest overall HEV seropositivity in Plovdiv district (6.2%; 4/64; p = 0.203) and Smolyan district (8.8%; 4/45; p = 0.129), vs. the highest in Pazardzhik district (21.6%; 29/134; p = 0.024) and Burgas district (28.8%; 26/90; p = 0.062). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first serological evidence of HEV infection in dogs, cats, horses, cattle, sheep, and goats from Bulgaria. We found high HEV seropositivity in small ruminants (sheep and goats), moderate seropositivity in pets (dogs and cats), and a low level of seropositivity in large animals (horses and cattle). Previous Bulgarian studies and the results of this research show that HEV infection is widespread among animals in our country. In this regard, the Bulgarian health authorities must carry out increased surveillance and control of HEV infection among animals in Bulgaria. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: To describe the use of an equine compression suit to manage a deep axillary wound in a Thoroughbred filly with bilateral pneumothorax. Case Summary: A 2-year-old Thoroughbred filly was referred for management of a deep wound to the left axilla. Packing and bandaging of the area were initially attempted, but this became repeatedly dislodged, and bandaging was discontinued. The filly subsequently developed widespread subcutaneous emphysema, and the wound was slow to granulate. Acute onset respiratory distress occurred 11 days after admission, secondary to bilateral worsening pneumothorax, and required placement of a chest drain. A commercially available equine compression suit was then successfully used to hold a primary dressing in place. This resulted in a marked improvement in the subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax. Wound granulation subsequently progressed well, and the filly was discharged from the clinic on day 36. Unique Information Provided: This case report highlights the potential applicability of a compression suit as an alternative to a stent to effectively prevent entry of air and successfully manage axillary wounds in the horse. It was also noted how delayed the progression of a pneumothorax can be after inadequate bandaging of a deep wound in the axillary region. The compression suit provided an alternative means of securing a dressing onto an awkwardly placed wound and may be useful in locations other than the axilla. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2023.

ABSTRACT: Fibrinogen and serum amyloid A (SAA) are commonly measured equine acute phase proteins. Limited data exist on SAA and fibrinogen responses to combination vaccination protocols in horses. A prospective cohort study evaluating SAA, fibrinogen, and rectal temperature following a standard combination vaccination. Blood for measurement of SAA and serum fibrinogen and rectal temperatures were obtained before (0 hour) and after vaccination (24, 48, 72, 96, 168 hours). After vaccination, SAA and fibrinogen increased in all horses. Imports had elevated SAA from 24–168 hours, whereas native horses returned to baseline by 168 hours. Compared to native horses, SAA was significantly higher in imports (coefficient 24–168 hours 358, 95%CI: 46–671 mg/L; P =.03). Fibrinogen increased significantly from 24 to 168 hours postvaccination, but groups did not differ (coefficient −16; 95%CI: −69 to 37 mg/dL; P =.5). Absolute rectal temperatures were significantly higher in imports throughout, including 0 hour (median 37.8; IQR 37.7–38.0 vs. 37.3; 37.1–37.3; P =.002). At 24 hours postvaccination when temperatures significantly increased above baseline in both groups, there was a small but significant difference in the percent change relative to baseline (coefficient 1.9; 95%CI 0.8%–2.9%; P =.002). A standard combination vaccination protocol elicited an acute phase response in all horses. Compared to native previously vaccinated horses, imports had a stronger SAA response. The observed response is worthy of consideration when examining recently vaccinated imported horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (i.v.) morphine in the horse have been described; however, administration of therapeutic doses has also been associated with neuroexcitation and adverse gastrointestinal effects. In this study, we hypothesized that oral administration would lead to comparable concentrations of morphine and its presumed active metabolite, morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G) without the adverse effects associated with i.v. administration. Eight horses were administered a single i.v. dose of 0.2 mg/kg morphine and oral doses of 0.2, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg of morphine in a four-way balanced crossover design, with a 2-week washout period between doses. Concentrations of morphine and metabolites were determined, and pharmacokinetic parameters determined. Physiologic and behavioral outcomes including the number of steps taken, changes in heart rate, and gastrointestinal borborygmi were assessed. Oral administration of morphine resulted in higher concentrations of morphine metabolites, including M6G (Cmax: 11.6–37.8 ng/mL (0.6 mg/kg); 15.8–42.6 ng/mL (0.8 mg/kg)), compared with i.v. Bioavailability was 36.5%, 27.6% and 28.0% for 0.2, 0.6 and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively. Behavioral and physiologic changes were noted in all groups but were less prominent with oral compared with i.v. administration. Results of the current study are encouraging for further study, specifically anti-nociceptive effects of morphine following oral administration. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This case series reviews the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for surgical site infections (SSI) on the upper body of six horses at an academic referral institution between 2016 and 2020. The SSIs consisted of three ventral midline celiotomy incisions post-abdominal exploratory, one paralumbar flank incision for removal of an ovarian abscess, an incision for resection of a septic jugular vein, and a large defect resulting from the resection of chronically abscessed skin and subcutaneous tissue on the shoulder and pectoral region. All SSIs contained zoonotic, polymicrobial, multi-drug resistant pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or extended spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella or Enterobacteriaceae) that were managed without systemic, regional, or topical antimicrobials. All horses were discharged from the hospital, and long-term follow-up revealed satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes according to owner questionnaires. Duration of NPWT ranged from 4 to 15 days in five horses, but one horse required NPWT for 70 days due to the large nature of the defect. The NPWT system was easy to use, well-tolerated by patients, and produced acceptable functional and cosmetic outcomes for the clients. By containing wound exudate and reducing daily wound care, it improved hospital biosecurity and reduced exposure to hospital personnel. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone produced during activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) in response to psychological or physiological demands. High amounts of circulating cortisol can be found in individuals experiencing energetically demanding physiological events, such as pregnancy, lactation, injury, or starvation, but, also, in individuals who may have less obvious HPA activation from social situations. The feral horse population on Sable Island (Nova Scotia, Canada) provides an opportunity to look at hair cortisol concentration (HCC) as a proxy for circulating cortisol concentration to better understand physiological correlates. The horse’s complex social structure also allows us to look at how the population and group structure may influence HPA activation. Hair samples (n = 282) were analyzed from 113 females and 135 males. Females with dependent offspring (foals) had higher HCC than those females without dependent offspring (p = 0.005). Horses in poor body condition were also more likely to have higher HCC (females: p < 0.001, males: p = 0.028); females had greater variation in the body condition index (BCI), which also correlated with foal production. In general, the top-ranked models describing female cortisol levels included age, BCI, presence of a foal, as well as social measures such as harem size and the number of bachelors in the vicinity. The top model describing male cortisol levels included age, BCI, and year of collection only, and the number of bachelors in the home range appeared in subsequent, though still high-ranked, models. Among the variables not of direct interest, we found some significant results relating to hair color and hair texture. Differences in HCC patterns between feral and domestically kept horses (e.g., age and sex) are likely linked to periods of resource limitations, particularly for individuals experiencing energetically demanding processes such as reproduction, illness/parasitism, or related to experiencing the full range of social and reproductive behaviors. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Sumbawa wild horse mik is pure milk produced by a mare which is bred in sumbawa and is a healthy drink that has antibacterial activity and longer shelf life duration without using preservatives. This study aims to analyze the shelf life and antibacterial activity of Sumbawa wild horse milk (SWHM) against Escherecia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, with test parameters including water content, fat content, protein content, pH, and testing was carried out on the 15th day and 30th day after milking and storage at room temperature. The results showed that SWHM did not decay or changes in levels that were far different during the storage period of 15-30 days at room temperature, with the results of fat content of 86.182% and 1.6650%, protein content of 2.1624% and 2.2961%, 86.1821% water content and pH 5.21 and 4.00. Antibacterial activity plays more role in inhibiting Escherichia coli bacteria compared to Staphylococcus aureus with a concentration of 50%, 75%, and 100% with a maximum inhibition of 12.77 mm. © 2023, Jambi University.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report arthroscopic osteochondral fragment removal from the equine cervical spine articular process joints (APJs) including long-term follow-up. Study Design: Case series. Animals: Three Warmblood horses with forelimb lameness and/or reduced range of motion of the cervical spine with osteochondral fragments between the cervical vertebrae C5/C6 or C6/C7. Method: Arthroscopy of the APJs of C5/C6 and C6/C7 was performed under general anesthesia. Following endoscopic evaluation of the joints, osteochondral fragments were removed using a rongeur. Results: All horses recovered from anesthesia with no anesthetic or minor postanesthetic complications. One horse needed a second procedure for fragment removal. Fourteen to 31 months post-surgery the horses were sound for their intended use and neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Conclusion: Arthroscopic removal of osteochondral fragments can be performed safely in the equine cervical APJs of C5/C6 and C6/C7 resulting in a favorable long-term outcome. Clinical Significance: Arthroscopic removal is a valid option for horses showing clinical signs that can be attributed to osteochondral fragments in the APJs of the neck. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Essential oils as natural plant extracts have received significant attention in recent time. The extracts of thyme play vital roles in the metabolic and regulatory functions of the body. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of thyme essential oil on the metabolic functions in endurance horses and to determine the dose for the optimal levels of major biochemical parameters. Thyme essential oils were administered orally to the horses at doses of 150 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg body weight by mixing the oil with their diet. Serum biochemical parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, urea, uric acid, total proteins, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase were evaluated according to standard methods. The results showed that the addition of thyme to the horses' diets seems to have a beneficial effect with decrease in key biochemical parameter like total cholesterol (0.68 ± 0.02 g/L), uric acid (0.006 ± 0. 0005 g/L), and alanine aminotransferase (7.90 ± 5.28 g/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (213.00 ± 47.46 g/L) at 150 mg/kg, and decrease in triglycerides (0.27 ± 0.28 g/L), creatinine (0.013 ± 0.004 mg/L), and urea (0.28 ± 0.09 mg/L) at 600 mg/kg. Thyme-based diet could help improve the fitness, performance, and overall wellbeing of race horses through optimization of their serum biochemical profile. © 2023 Dahmani et al.

ABSTRACT: The indiscriminate use of drugs to control gastrointestinal helminths in horses can lead to serious consequences for the animals, which represents a growing problem for health, animal welfare and productivity. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of ivermectin in naturally infected horses in the western region of the state of São Paulo. From May 2021 to April 2022, 123 naturally infected adult horses in 12 equine breeding farms (7 to 14 animals per farm) were evaluated with the fecal egg count reduction test. The horses had not been treated with anthelmintic drugs for at least 60 days before the start of the study. The animals were treated with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg; Eqvalan®, Merial) administered orally according to recommended dosage by the manufacturer. Individual fecal samples were collected directly from the rectal ampulla and used to determine the eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and perform coproculture for identification of larvae on the day of anthelmintic treatment (D0) and 14 days later (D14). The fecal egg count reduction (FECR) on each property was calculated using the program Shiny-egg Counts R version 3.6.1, and the presence of anthelmintic resistance was confirmed when the FECR percentage was less than 95%, and when the lower confidence limit [LCI] was less than 90%. The pre-treatment average EPG count in the 12 properties was 991. In five properties the FECR was lower than 90%; in three properties between 90% and 95%; and in four properties equal to or greater than 95% after treatment with ivermectin. The occurrence of cyathostomins with resistance to ivermectin was recorded in the majority of the farms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Equine periodontal disease (EPD) is a painful oral inflammatory syndrome characterized by multifactorial pathogenesis. Although it is well known that bacterial proliferation and consequent gingivitis are caused by the decomposition process of food residues, in hypsodont species, the pathogenetic role and the different bacterial species involved in the progression of EPD must be fully clarified. This study aimed to investigate the association of bacteria, including the complex red bacteria (RCB), with EPD, and to evaluate possible EPD risk factors. Bacterial species, including Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis (belonging to the RCB), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veilonella parvula, and Prevotella intermedia, were investigated in 125 oral swabs from healthy and EPD-affected horses using real-time multiplex PCR. Subsequently, possible risk factors (i.e., age, gender, and breed of the animals and type of feed used) were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Tannerella spp. and Treponema spp. were detected in a significantly higher proportion of horses affected by EPD than in healthy animals, although pathogens belonging to RCB were detected in low number of horses. At the same time, none of the investigated pathogens was significantly associated with a particular stage of disease severity. Horses aged older than 20 years were at higher risk of EPD. The high rate of coinfection, statistically associated with EPD, supports the hypothesis that EPD is a complex syndrome characterized by the possible simultaneous involvement of several pathogens and an increased risk depending on the animal’s age. Constant oral hygiene is the best prevention to prevent and treat the disease, especially in old animals. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: There are limited data on Lyme borreliosis (LB), a tick-borne disease caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, in horses. Seropositivity is not necessarily associated with clinical disease. Data on seropositivity against Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in German horses are sparse. Therefore, serum samples from horses (n = 123) suspected of having Lyme borreliosis and clinically healthy horses (n = 113) from the same stables were tested for specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. The samples were screened for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi (ELISA and an IgG line immunoblot assay). Furthermore, the samples were examined for antibodies against B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum with a validated rapid in-house test (SNAP® 4Dx Plus® ELISA). The clinical signs of suspect horses included lameness (n = 36), poor performance (n = 19), and apathy (n = 12). Twenty-three percent (n = 26) of suspect horses and 17% (n = 18) of clinically healthy horses were seropositive for having a Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection (p = 0.371), showing that the detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine LB. Anaplasma phagocytophilum seropositivity and seropositivity against both pathogens was 20%/6% in suspect horses and 16%/2% in the clinically healthy population, showing only minor differences (p = 0.108). Unspecific testing for antibodies against B. burgdorferi without clinical suspicion of Lyme borreliosis is not recommended since the clinical relevance of seropositivity against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato remains to be elucidated. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Przewalski’s horses live in stable nonterritorial families (harem) of one or more harem stallions, several mares, and their offspring. The harem stallion typically behaves aggressively towards any male intruder approaching the harem. Play behaviour is frequently observed among the group members in horses. For stallions, the most common, well-known cases of play behaviour are found between members of bachelor groups (groups of young stallions) and between the harem stallion and his offspring. The play between the harem stallion and members of the bachelor groups is, on the other hand, seemingly much rarer as a description of such events in the literature is anecdotal. In this note, we present our observation conducted in the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area (Mongolia) and describe the play behaviour between a Przewalski’s horse harem stallion and members of a bachelor group. The observation was done as a part of broader research during which selected Przewalski’s horses’ groups were located by binoculars in daily monitoring routines and filmed from a close distance (from 150 to 800 m). Behavioural Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) was used to extract data from the video recordings. The observation described in this note lasted for ∼ 180 min, during which the horses engaged in three separate bouts of play and repeated inter-group association. During the whole study (241.5 h of video recordings), this was the only observation including inter-group interactions. We observed two other events during which two harems approached each other (but never merged). Our observation is the first video recording of such an event and raises the question of how prevalent this behaviour is in the Przewalski’s horses’ restored natural populations. We conclude that this behaviour is unusual or has not been sufficiently studied in wild or feral harems. Further technological advances may help reveal more information on this topic. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cardiac adaptation to conditioning in horses was evaluated after empirical training based on trainers’ experience. Twelve purebred Arabian horses, aged (mean ± SD) 28.42 ± 3.75 months, which did not perform any type of exercise prior to the research, were submitted to treadmill conditioning for six weeks. The conditioning program was based on the velocity run by the horse at which the blood lactate concentration, determined in an incremental exercise test (IET), reached 2 mmol/L (V2). The velocity at which the blood lactate concentration reached 4 mmol/L (V4) was also determined. The echocardiograms were performed at rest with pulsed-wave and tissue Doppler imaging in B- and M-modes. All procedures were carried out before and after the conditioning period. The results showed increases in V2 (from 5.2 ± 0.3 to 6.7 ± 0.4 m/s) and V4 (from 5.8 ± 0.4 to 7.6 ± 0.5 m/s) (p < 0.0001). There were also increases in the left ventricle internal diameter at diastole (LVIDd), left ventricle mass (LV mass), and stroke volume (SV), while no changes were observed in the LV free wall thickness and mean and relative wall thicknesses. The conditioning protocol, which was completed by all horses, proved to be safe and efficient, as it improved the aerobic capacity of the animals. Finally, the cardiac remodeling that occurred was mainly associated with the effect of physical training. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: IgE-binding monocytes are a rare peripheral immune cell type involved in the allergic response through binding of IgE on their surface. IgE-binding monocytes are present in both healthy and allergic individuals. We performed RNA sequencing to ask how the function of IgE-binding monocytes differs in the context of allergy. Using a large animal model of allergy, equine Culicoides hypersensitivity, we compared the transcriptome of IgE-binding monocytes in allergic and non-allergic horses at two seasonal timepoints: (i) when allergic animals were clinical healthy, in the winter “Remission Phase”, and (ii) during chronic disease, in the summer “Clinical Phase”. Most transcriptional differences between allergic and non-allergic horses occurred only during the “Remission Phase”, suggesting principal differences in monocyte function even in the absence of allergen exposure. F13A1, a subunit of fibrinoligase, was significantly upregulated at both timepoints in allergic horses. This suggested a role for increased fibrin deposition in the coagulation cascade to promote allergic inflammation. IgE-binding monocytes also downregulated CCR10 expression in allergic horses during the “Clinical Phase”, suggesting a defect in maintenance of skin homeostasis, which further promotes allergic inflammation. Together, this transcriptional analysis provides valuable clues into the mechanisms used by IgE-binding monocytes in allergic individuals. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The effects of gait and diameter have been studied independently, but rarely together in equine circular exercise studies. This study aimed to determine the impact of diameter (10-m or 15-m) at various gaits (walk, trot, and canter) on stride frequency or forelimb stance duration. Nine mature horses were outfitted with Tekscan™ Hoof Sensors on their forelimbs during circular and straight-line exercise at various gaits on a clay and sand arena surface. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.4 with fixed effects of exercise type, recording, leg, and breed (PROC GLIMMIX, p < 0.05 significance). At walk (p < 0.0001) and trot (p < 0.001), stride frequency was lower during circular exercise. Stride frequency was similar between forelimbs at all gaits. At walk (p < 0.001) and canter (p = 0.01), stance duration was greatest during 10-m circle exercise. At walk (p = 0.0007), trot (p < 0.001), and canter (p < 0.0001), the inside forelimb had longer stance duration than the outside forelimb. Differences between forelimb stance durations may support asymmetrical travel while horses exercise on a circle at the walk, trot, and canter. These results demonstrate diameter and gait are important factors when evaluating forelimb kinematics during circular exercise. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This case report describes a practical method for resolving a hard to localize abscess in a horse resulting from a traumatic injury near the stifle joint. When the horse presented for a chronic draining tract, a foreign body was suspected, with no external indication of location. Although ultrasonography was attempted to localize the abscess, the practitioner could not confidently identify the source of the draining tract. Radiography revealed a gas-filled cavity approximately 28 cm proximal to the tract opening. In order to establish continuity between the tract opening and the presumed suppurative cavity, the practitioner developed a malleable radiopaque probe from readily available materials. Ultrasonography combined with the radiopaque probe allowed for confident localization and formulation of a surgical plan. The use of inexpensive available materials minimized cost and avoided delays in diagnosis and treatment. This improvised fistulographic method is suitable for practitioners at any skill level or practice setting. © 2022 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Ensuring the authenticity of horse-, donkey- and pig-related meat products is of great religious and economic significance. In this study, with the mitochondrial genes of ATPase 6 or ND2 as targets, the species-specific real-time enzymatic recombinase amplification (real-time ERA) and ERA combined with lateral flow strip (LFS ERA) assays for horse, donkey and pig ingredients were developed. The optimization results showed that both ERA assays had the same optimal temperature for the detection of horse, donkey and pig ingredients, i.e., 39 °C for real-time ERA and 37 °C for LFS ERA, respectively. The assays could be performed simultaneously and the results could obtained within 25 min. Both developed assays showed good specificity and no cross-reactions with other common meat species were observed. The limit of detection of the developed ERA assays for horse, donkey and pig ingredients was 10 pg genomic DNA/per reaction and 0.1% target meat (w/w). Their applicability were verified with 45 donkey meat products (both raw and marinated minced meat), and the results showed that the detection rate of horse or pig ingredient was as high as 53.33%, including a complete substitution or partial substitution of donkey meat. The results were consistent with those of the standard real-time PCR in China, but the whole detection time was significantly reduced from 2 h to 35 min. It is concluded that the developed real-time ERA and LFS ERA assays are feasible for the rapid authentication of horse, donkey and pig meats and identification of the adulteration of donkey meat-related products. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Context: Deworming all horses with commercial anthelmintics on a rotational basis every 90 days is still popular worldwide. Aims: To investigate anthelmintic resistance and therapeutic requirements of adult horses on the basis of faecal examinations after a rotation between commercial anthelmintics commonly used in Brazil. Methods: We followed up faecal egg counts and coprocultures of 29 horses for 7 months, after pre-established anthelmintic treatments, every 3 months (August and November 2019 and February 2020). The following commercial anthelmintics were used respectively: moxidectin (1), ivermectin + praziquantel (2) and trichlorfon + mebendazole (3). Faecal egg count (FEC), FEC reduction tests (FECRT) and coproculture were performed before (Day 0) and after 14 days for each of the three treatments. Wilcoxon test (95% confidence level, P < 0.05) was used to test the efficacy of the treatment on the FECRT and the occurrence of resistance to the treatments used. Results: The FEC results and percentage of individual FECRT indicated parasite resistance, and 82 of 87 (94%) deworming treatments were unnecessary. The efficacy rate was 78%, 34% and 53% for Treatments 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In the coprocultures before deworming, 98.5% were small strongyles, 1.1% Strongylus equinus and 0.4% Gyalocephalus capitatus. After deworming, 98.7% of parasites were small strongyles and 1.3% Dictyocaulus arnfieldi. FEC values at Day 0 and 14 days after anthelminthics were different (lower) only for the moxidectin treatment (U = 271.5; P-value <0.01). For both ivermectin + praziquantel (U = 373; P-value >0.05) and mebendazole + trichlorfon (U = 391; P-value >0.05) treatments, there was no difference in FEC between Day 0 and Day 14 at 95% confidence level. Conclusions: The anthelmintics used in the deworming protocol of this study had reduced efficacy against the parasites identified in the coprocultures and the pre-established treatments were probably unnecessary in 93% of the horses with a low level of infection. Implications: This study has highlighted not only the issue of the indiscriminate use of anthelmintics regarding parasitic resistance, but also the exposure of horses to unnecessary treatments. Such widespread use is a costly waste of resources and further reinforces the discontinuation of schedule rather than strategic deworming protocols. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Since 2018, autochthonous West Nile virus (WNV) infections have been regularly reported in eastern–central Germany. While clinically apparent infections in humans and horses are not frequent, seroprevalence studies in horses may allow the tracing of WNV and related flaviviruses transmission, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Usutu virus (USUV), and consequently help to estimate the risk of human infections. Hence, the aim of our study was to follow the seropositive ratio against these three viruses in horses in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, and Brandenburg and to describe their geographic distribution for the year 2021. In early 2022, i.e., before the virus transmission season, sera from 1232 unvaccinated horses were tested using a competitive pan-flavivirus ELISA (cELISA). In order to estimate the true seropositive ratio of infection with WNV, TBEV, and USUV for 2021, positive and equivocal results were confirmed by a virus neutralization test (VNT). In addition, possible risk factors for seropositivity using questionnaires were analyzed using logistic regression based on questionnaires similar to our previous study from 2020. In total, 125 horse sera reacted positive in the cELISA. Based on the VNT, 40 sera showed neutralizing antibodies against WNV, 69 against TBEV, and 5 against USUV. Three sera showed antibodies against more than one virus, and eight were negative based on the VNT. The overall seropositive ratio was 3.3% (95% CI: 2.38–4.40) for WNV, 5.6% (95% CI: 4.44–7.04) for TBEV, and 0.4% (95% CI: 0.14–0.98) for USUV infections. While age and number of horses on the holding were factors predicting TBEV seropositivity, no risk factors were discovered for WNV seropositivity. We conclude that horses are useful sentinels to determine the flavivirus circulation in eastern–central Germany, as long as they are not vaccinated against WNV. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasonography is commonly used to evaluate equine lameness-related structures, but traditional hoof approaches cannot adequately visualize internal structures such as the lamellar layer. To address this limitation, we used 62 healthy hooves without digital radiographic abnormalities, made up of thirty anatomical pieces (phase 1) and thirty-two hooves from living horses (phase 2). In both phases, half of the digits were submerged in water (group 1) and the other half in water and ice (group 2) for 24 h. Ultrasonographic views and temperature and humidity measurements were taken every two hours, and sagittal sections were obtained in phase 1. Good quality images were obtained in both phases. The transmural technique allowed the evaluation of several structures of the DEJ (tubular and lamellar strata of the hoof wall, sublamellar dermis, and solar and coronary papillae) and of the distal phalanx (extensor process, parietal surface, and apex). Our findings suggest that the transmural technique following hoof submersion can be useful for internal evaluation of hoof conditions, such as laminitis. However, further validation of the technique in natural or experimental cases is required. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Placentitis is the leading cause of infectious abortion in the horse. Additionally, it can result in weak and/or growth restricted offspring. While the etiology of ascending placentitis is well described in mares, less is known regarding the pathogenesis of other types, such as nocardioform placentitis. This study aims to identify the microbial communities in different body sites of the pregnant mare in early gestation to establish a core microbiome that may be perturbed in pathologic pregnancies such as placentitis. We hypothesize that the equine placenta harbors a distinct resident microbiome in early pregnancy when characterized by metagenetics and that there will be a disparity in bacterial communities from the oral, vaginal, and fecal microbiome. Samples were collected from the oral cavity, vagina, anus, and the allantoic portion of the allantochorion (“placenta”) from five pregnant mares between 96 and 120 days of gestation. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified for Illumina MiSeq sequencing to examine core bacterial communities present in the different body sites. Microbial community composition of the pregnant ponies by body site was significantly different (Bray–Curtis dissimilarity). The placenta was significantly different from the feces, oral cavity, and vagina. Alpha diversity measuring the Shannon diversity matrix was significant, with the body sites being a compounding variable, meaning there was a difference in richness and evenness in the different microbial communities. Feces had the greatest alpha diversity, while the oral cavity and placenta similarly had the least. In conclusion, metagenetics did reveal distinct community differences in the oral, fecal, vaginal, and placenta cavities of the horse. The equine placenta does show similarities in its microbial communities to the oral cavity. Further research needs to be completed to investigate how bacteria may be translocated to the placenta from these other body sites and how they contribute to the development of placentitis. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed the epidemiological relationship of Clostridium (C.) perfringens isolated from feces and soil of horse farm using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and then compared it with standard strains registered in the National Center for Biotechnology Information. MLST results using MEGA 6.0 showed that total 13 clusters were formed in the phylogenetic tree of the housekeeping genes sequence of the standard strains, and the Korea Isolate Ju (KSJ) strains were classified into 8 types (cluster 4, cluster 5, cluster 6, cluster 7, cluster 8, cluster 11, cluster 12, and cluster 13). The KSJ strains were categorized into 4 groups. Each group had a high bootstrap value (>90%). These results for C. perfringens are considered to be helpful for performing epidemiological investigations and establishing prevention methods for diseases in the future. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships within the Arabian show horse populations are of particular interest to breeders worldwide. Using the complete mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequence (916 pb), this study aimed (i) to understand the genetic relationship between three populations, the Desert-Bred (DB), a subset of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain (BAH), the Straight Egyptian (EG) and the Polish bloodline (PL), and (ii) to assess the accuracy of the traditional strain classification system based on maternal lines, as stated by the Bedouin culture. To that end, we collected 211 hair samples from stud farms renowned for breeding Arabian show horses from Nejd KSA, Bahrain, Egypt, Qatar, Morocco, UAE, and Poland. The phylogenetic and network analyses of the whole mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequence highlighted a great genetic diversity among the Arabian horse populations, in which about 75% of variance was assigned to populations and 25% to strains. The discriminant analysis of principal components illustrated a relative distinction between those populations. A clear subdivision between traditional strains was found in PL, in contrast to the situation of DB and EG populations. However, several Polish horse individuals could not be traced back to the Bedouin tribes by historical documentation and were shown to differ genetically from other studied Bedouin strains, hence motivating extended investigations. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Oral and parenteral drug delivery in horses can be difficult. Equine-specific transdermal drug formulations offer improved ease of treatment; development of such formulations requires a deeper understanding of the structural and chemical tissue barrier of horse skin. Hypothesis/Objectives: To compare the structural composition and barrier properties of equine skin. Animals: Six warmblood horses (two males, four females) with no skin diseases. Materials and Methods: Routine histological and microscopic analyses were carried out with image analysis for skin from six different anatomical locations. In vitro drug permeation was analysed using a standard Franz diffusion cell protocol coupled with reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography detailing flux, lag times and tissue partitioning ratios of two model drug compounds. Results: Epidermal and dermal thicknesses varied between sites. The dermal and epidermal thicknesses of the croup were 1764 ± 115 μm and 36 ± 3.6 μm, respectively, and were significantly different (p < 0.05) from the inner thigh thicknesses which were 824 ± 35 μm and 49 ± 3.6 μm. Follicular density and size also varied. The highest flux for the model hydrophilic molecule (caffeine) was for the flank (3.22 ± 0.36 μg/cm2/h), while that for the lipophilic molecule (ibuprofen) was for the inner thigh (0.12 ± 0.02 μg/cm2/h). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Anatomical location differences in equine skin structure and small molecule permeability were demonstrated. These results can aid in the development of transdermal therapies for horses. © 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Dermatology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of ESVD and ACVD.

ABSTRACT: According to the “unified or united airway disease” theory, diseases in the upper and lower airways frequently co-occur because they represent a single morphological and functional unit. Palatal disorders (PDs) and severe equine asthma (SEA) are frequent diseases that, respectively, affect upper and lower equine airways; however, clinical studies focusing on the co-occurrence of PDs and SEA are limited. The present study investigated the prevalence of PDs in horses affected by SEA, and whether prevalence decreased after SEA treatment. Forty-six privately owned horses affected by SEA in exacerbation were included. For each horse, the severity of the asthma clinical signs was assessed using a previously described scoring system, and the co-occurrence of palatal disorders was investigated using overground endoscopy, before and after treatment for SEA. Before treatment (in exacerbation), 67.4% of SEA-affected horses showed evidence of PDs, including 39.1% showing evidence of palatal instability (PI) and 28.3% of dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). Airway inflammation (neutrophil percentage in the tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) was worse in horses with co-occurring PDs. After treatment (in remission), no horses showed evidence of PI, while DDSP was diagnosed in 8.7% of horses. These findings suggest that palatal disorders respond to asthma treatment, supporting the hypothesis that both diseases could be manifestation of a common underlying disorder. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The polar cap can become teardrop shaped through the poleward expansion of the dusk and dawn sectors of the auroral oval, to form what is called horse collar aurora (HCA). The formation of HCA has been linked to dual-lobe reconnection (DLR) where magnetic flux is closed at the dayside magnetopause. A prolonged period of northward IMF is required for the formation of HCA. HCA have previously been identified in UV images captured by the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) instrument on-board the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft F16, F17 and F18. Events that have concurrent 630.0 nm all-sky camera (ASC) data from the Redline Geospace Observatory (REGO) Resolute Bay site are now studied in more detail, making use of the higher cadence of the ASC images compared to DMSP/SSUSI. 11 HCA events are studied and classified based on the IMF conditions at the end of the event. Five of the events were found to end via a southward turning of the IMF, two end with positive By dominated IMF and four with negative By dominance. Under positive (negative) By the arcs move duskward (dawnward) in the northern hemisphere with the opposite true in the southern hemisphere. Under a southward turning the arcs move equatorward. One event is of particular interest as it occurred while there was a transpolar arc (TPA) also present. Understanding the evolution of HCA will allow DLR to be studied in more detail. © 2023.

ABSTRACT: The proportion of different muscle fibers is essential for the horse breed's aptitude for athletic activities. Adaptation of locomotor muscle is correlated with altered physiologic conditions. To investigate the adaptive changes of muscle fiber phenotype and transcriptome in horse skeletal muscle during dietary restriction (DR). The muscle fiber type distribution and deep RNA-seq analysis of detecting differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs), miRNA (DEMIRs), lncRNAs (DELs), circRNAs (DECs), and their function analysis were investigated in gluteus medius muscle of Mongolian horses during DR. A total of 1433 DEGs, 5 DEMIRs, 329 DELs, and 53 DECs were identified. Differing from non-uniform muscle fiber type changing, functional enrichment analysis showed that most downregulated DEGs were associated in muscle contraction, fuel energy metabolism, and protein balance. Linkages between non-coding RNA and mRNA landscape were detected from their functional changes. Our study provides new insights into the expressional changes of mRNA and non-coding RNA in horse skeletal muscles during DR, which might improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle adaption during DR for racing horses. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The proportion of the genome containing runs of homozygosity (ROH) affects production traits in livestock populations. In European and Australasian Thoroughbreds inbreeding, quantified using ROH (FROH), is associated with the probability of ever racing. Here, we measured FROH using 333 K SNP genotypes from 768 Thoroughbred horses born in North America to evaluate the effect of inbreeding on racing traits in that region. Among North American horses, FROH was not associated (p = 0.518) with the probability of ever racing but was significantly associated with the number of race starts (p = 0.002). Among raced horses, those with a 10% higher FROH than the mean inbreeding coefficient were predicted to have 3.5 fewer race starts compared to horses with a mean inbreeding coefficient. Considering the trend of increasing inbreeding and a decline in the average number of race starts per runner in North America, mitigating inbreeding in the population could positively influence racing durability. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The addition of calcium to resuscitation fluids is a common practice in horses, but studies evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation are limited. In healthy horses, decreases in heart rate and changes in serum electrolyte concentrations have been reported. Hypothesis: Calcium gluconate administration at a rate of 0.4 mg/kg/min to eliminated endurance horses with metabolic problems will affect heart rate, gastrointestinal sounds, and serum electrolyte concentrations. Animals: Endurance horses eliminated from the Tevis Cup 100-mile (160 km) endurance ride for metabolic problems and requiring IV fluid therapy were eligible. Methods: Sixteen horses were randomly assigned to receive 0.4 mg/kg/min of calcium (23% calcium gluconate solution) over 1 hour diluted in 10 L of a non-calcium containing isotonic crystalloid (CAL group) or 10 L of a non-calcium containing isotonic crystalloid (CON group). Staff members administering the fluids were blinded to treatment group. Blood samples were collected and physical examinations performed before and after treatment. Heart rates were recorded every 15 min during fluid administration. Data were compared using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Results: Calcium was associated with lower heart rates 45 min after starting the infusion (P =.002). Gastrointestinal sounds were less likely to improve in the calcium group compared with the control group (P =.005). An increase in plasma phosphorus concentration (P =.03) was associated with calcium administration. Conclusions: Intravenous calcium supplementation to endurance horses eliminated from competition after development of metabolic problems may decrease heart rate but impairs improvement in gastrointestinal sounds. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration is commonly measured to diagnose pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect ACTH concentrations, including breed. The objective of this study was to prospectively compare plasma ACTH concentrations among different breeds of mature horses and ponies. Three breed groups comprised Thoroughbred horses (n = 127), Shetland ponies (n = 131) and ponies of non-Shetland breeds (n = 141). Enrolled animals did not show any signs of illness, lameness or clinical signs consistent with PPID. Blood samples were collected 6 months apart, around the autumn equinox and spring equinox, and plasma concentrations of ACTH were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay. Pairwise breed comparisons within each season were performed on log transformed data using the Tukey test. Estimated mean differences in ACTH concentrations were expressed as fold difference with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Reference intervals for each breed group per season were calculated using non-parametric methods. In autumn, higher ACTH concentrations were found among non-Shetland pony breeds compared with Thoroughbreds (1.55 fold higher; 95 % CI, 1.35–1.77; P < 0.001), and in Shetland ponies compared with Thoroughbreds (2.67 fold higher; 95 % CI, 2.33–3.08; P < 0.001) and non-Shetland pony breeds (1.73 fold higher; 95 % CI, 1.51–1.98; P < 0.001). In spring, no differences were identified among breed groups (all P > 0.05). Reference intervals were similar among breed groups in spring, but upper limits for ACTH concentrations were markedly different between Thoroughbred horses and pony breeds in autumn. These findings emphasise that breed should be accounted for when determining and interpreting reference intervals for ACTH concentrations among healthy horses and ponies in autumn. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This review article focuses on the interaction of radionuclides (americium-241, uranium-232, radium-226, neptunium-237, cesium-137, iodine-125, strontium-90, thorium-234, and potassium-40) with different microplastics (polyamide (PN6), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and single-use surgical face (SSF) masks. It has been shown that microplastics (MPs) and SSF masks can act as carriers of radionuclides thus helping the toxic pollutants to migrate and concentrate into the environment and possibly enter the food chain. High values of adsorption affinity were reported for various polymers, with the adsorption partition coefficient reaching up 2670 (L/kg) in the case of U-232 adsorption on polyamide (PN6). Generally, the type and the particle size of MPs, the solution pH, and the nature of the aquatic system (de-ionized water, groundwater, and seawater) are found to be significant factors in radionuclides’ adsorption onto MPs. The mechanism of adsorption depends on various parameters and the formation of outer- or inner-sphere complexes between the radionuclide and specific sites/functional groups on MPs surface. Desorption of the radionuclides is also an important aspect since for instance, a high desorption rate was noticed in low pH (pH<4) and using complexing agents such as EDTA. Future work should focus on the investigation of the interaction of MPs and radionuclides using real wastewater, column studies, and multi-component systems. Biofilms’ growth on the MPs surface and studying the interaction of biofilm-coated microplastics with radionuclides would also be of particular interest. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Cameraria ohridella is one of the most invasive pests of horse chestnut. Cyantraniliprole is one of the most perspectively active insecticides, which can transport within the plant in several ways, and its efficacy against this pest has not yet been tested. All three modes of application were effective against the target pest, but there was a difference in the time of action between them. However, no demonstrable difference in the speed of action was detected between the doses used. A more intense rate of acropetal translocation was confirmed compared to basipetal translocation. A trend-like effect between the applied concentration of cyantraniliprole and the photon emission intensity per unit area of plant tissue was observed in the translaminar and acropetal treatment settings. In both cases, a clear increase in photon emission was observed, indicating metabolic upregulation. Therefore, we can conclude that biophoton emission measurements can be utilized to conduct efficient pesticide translocation investigations. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The combination of sulfadoxine (SDO) with trimethoprim (TMP) is widely used in veterinarian medicine. The aim of the present study was to compare excretion profiles and detection time windows of SDO and TMP in plasma and urine by means of a validated quantitative method. Eight horses received a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 2.7 mg TMP and 13.4 mg SDO per kg bodyweight. Plasma and urine samples were collected up to 15 and 70 days post-administration, respectively. While urine samples underwent an enzymatic hydrolysis, plasma samples were proteolysed before further analysis. After solid-phase extraction, samples were analysed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry in positive ionisation mode. The applied multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method allowed the detection of SDO and TMP with a lower limit of detection of 0.03 ng/mL in plasma and 0.2 (SDO) and 0.4 ng/mL (TMP) in urine, respectively. In the present study, detection times for SDO were 15 days in plasma and 49 days in urine, respectively. TMP was detected for up to 7 days in plasma and up to 50 days in urine, respectively. The detection via the TMP metabolite 3-desmethyl-trimethoprim was possible for 70 days in urine. Detection times of the other confirmed metabolites N4-acetylated sulfadoxine, hydroxytrimethoprim, trimethoprim-1-oxide and trimethoprim-3-oxide were significantly lower. In order to postulate reasonable screening limits (SLs) to control specific withdrawal times, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed for SDO. The proposed SL of 10 ng/mL SDO in blood and 300 ng/mL urine corresponds to a detection time of 4 days. © 2023 The Authors. Drug Testing and Analysis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In the genomes of diploid organisms, runs of homozygosity (ROH), consecutive segments of homozygosity, are extended. ROH can be applied to evaluate the inbreeding situation of individuals without pedigree data and to detect selective signatures via ROH islands. We sequenced and analyzed data derived from the whole-genome sequencing of 97 horses, investigated the distribution of genome-wide ROH patterns, and calculated ROH-based inbreeding coefficients for 16 representative horse varieties from around the world. Our findings indicated that both ancient and recent inbreeding occurrences had varying degrees of impact on various horse breeds. However, recent inbreeding events were uncommon, particularly among indigenous horse breeds. Consequently, the ROH-based genomic inbreeding coefficient could aid in monitoring the level of inbreeding. Using the Thoroughbred population as a case study, we discovered 24 ROH islands containing 72 candidate genes associated with artificial selection traits. We found that the candidate genes in Thoroughbreds were involved in neurotransmission (CHRNA6, PRKN, and GRM1), muscle development (ADAMTS15 and QKI), positive regulation of heart rate and heart contraction (HEY2 and TRDN), regulation of insulin secretion (CACNA1S, KCNMB2, and KCNMB3), and spermatogenesis (JAM3, PACRG, and SPATA6L). Our findings provide insight into horse breed characteristics and future breeding strategies. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Infectious diseases remain a constant threat to human and animal populations, with the potential for far-reaching and diverse impacts on health, welfare, trade, livelihoods and the economy. Over recent years, many infectious diseases have increased in incidence and geographical range and this is the result of a multitude of factors, of which population expansion, globalisation and climate change are notable. With increased international connectivity, emergence and re-emergence of exotic diseases have arisen on multiple occasions in the UK. Aim of the article: This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, control and prevention of the key equine vectorborne diseases. It also outlines the surveillance initiatives in place for detection of these diseases, and the current risk status they pose to the UK equine population. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The external ear extends from the pinna to the tympanic membrane, where it is supported and shaped by an arrangement of cartilages including the conchal, annular, scutiform, and external acoustic meatus. Environmental exposure can often lead to diseases of the external ear canal in animals. In horses, otitis primarily occurs due to infestation by ectoparasites, promoting local inflammation and infection. Chronic conditions can result in ear deformation, including auricular canal stenosis. While operative techniques for treating auricular stenosis are known, they are limited to companion animals, with few reports on horses. This study aimed to describe the modified lateral resection technique of the ear canal, which is commonly performed in small animals, for treating auricular canal stenosis in six horses. As a methodology, the intertragic notch was used as a reference for the incision due to species disparity. The ear canal cartilage was dissected, followed by resection of the lateral wall and the cartilaginous flap adhered to the skin. Excess skin was removed, and the ear canal was sutured to the skin with nylon thread. Our results indicated a significant improvement in the treatment of otitis in the treated horses, demonstrating a favorable evolution in the healing process and resolution of bacterial infections in all cases. In conclusion, the use of the modified lateral resection technique of the ear canal was successful in all six treated horses, providing access to clinical treatment of the canal without any occurrences of recurrence or postoperative complications. © 2023 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido.

ABSTRACT: Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by an obligate intra-cellular pathogen called Coxiella burnetii affecting a broad range of animal hosts including horses. Most of the isolates found carry plasmids which genetic studies of C. burnetii strains suggest a critical role in C. burnetii survival. The correlation between an isolated plasmid type and the chronic or acute nature of the disease has always been controversial. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of C. burnetii QpH1 and QpDG plasmids in horses and assess the potential role of these species as reservoirs of infection and transmission. Nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed on 320 blood serum samples drawn from horses in West Azerbaijan province, Iran, in 2020. In total, 26 (8.13%) Q fever-positive samples based on containing the IS1111 gene were tested by nested-PCR approach to amplify QpH1 and QpDG plasmid segments. The QpH1 and QpRS plasmid-specific sequences were identified in 19 (73.07%) and none in the serum samples, respectively. According to the present study, the age of the animal can be considered as an important risk factor for the prevalence of C. burnetii; but, the season, sex, and breed of the horse had no effect on the prevalence of disease. The results indicate that nested-PCR method could be suitable for routine diagnosis, to gather new information about the shedding of C. burnetii, and to improve the knowledge of contamination routes. © 2023 Urmia University.

ABSTRACT: The aim of our study was to analyze circadian rhythm of the hematological profile of horses housed in a loose box and paddock during the different seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). Blood samples were performed every 4 h for 48 consecutive hours. Red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), white blood cells (WBCs), platelets (PLTs), and leukocyte subpopulations (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) were analyzed, and, at the same time, environmental conditions were recorded. A statistically significant effect of housing conditions (p < 0.0001) was observed on all hematological values except for WBC during winter and for neutrophils (p < 0.0001) during spring and autumn. A statistically significant effect of season (p < 0.0001) was found for RBC, HCT, and PLT and for all leukocyte cells (p < 0.0001) except for basophils. The single Cosinor method revealed a daily rhythm of hematological parameters during spring in both groups, and a daily rhythm for lymphocytes and neutrophils was observed during spring and summer in horses kept in a loose box and during winter in horses housed in a paddock. Our results revealed that the response of the immune system is regulated by circadian physiology. Knowledge of the periodic temporal structure of mammals should be considered when evaluating animals’ adaptation to temporizations imposed by the environment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The study of the leafmining moth of the chestnut miner (Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dymić, 1986) was carried out through the planting of the common horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in the Main Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The effect of various degrees of insolation of horse chestnut plants on leaf morphology and the composition of secondary metabolites, as well as the relationship of these parameters with the number and density of C. ohridella populations during the growing season, was studied. The solar influence, it was noted, had a significant impact. Thus, the largest number of the pests was recorded on the leaves of the sunlit side of the tree crown, and the smallest on the leaves of the shady part of the crown. The low content of polyphenols in the pool of secondary metabolites in the tissues of the A. hippocastanum leaves did not deter C. ohridella and poorly protected the plants from this miner, while the significant content of carbohydrates in the leaves reduced the resistance of chestnut plants to damage by the Ohrid leaf miner. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Ticks have saliva rich in immunoregulatory molecules that interfere with the host’s physiology in order to feed. This study aimed to evaluate the concentration of acute phase proteins and circulating oxidative stress in response to infestation by Amblyomma sculptum and Dermacentor nitens in two breed horses, Mangalarga Marchador and Breton Postier, to define resistance or susceptibility to ticks. Among the oxidative stress markers, we observed lower malondialdehyde and nitric oxide in horses with tick infestation, consequently not altering the antioxidant enzymes. Breton Postier with tick infestation showed a reduction in the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), which may be due to lower feeding of the host due to the stress caused by the infestation or even to sequestration of components induced by the tick during blood feeding. The alpha-1-antitrypsin, an acute phase protein, showed an increase in Mangalarga Marchador with tick infestation; curiously it is related to a protective action against tissue damage, pathogens and parasites. We could assume that Mangalarga Marchador showed a better response to ticks when compared to Breton Postier. However, it is still early to define the resistance or susceptibility to ticks, as we did not observe significant changes in most of the analyzed variables. Further studies are needed to understand the compounds and mechanisms of action of the tick saliva in the acute phase proteins and the possible relationships of oxidative stress in the host and the tick during blood feeding. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Context. Overseer® is the primary software tool used to estimate farm-level nutrient cycle and management for regulatory purposes in New Zealand. The model compares feed demand among different livestock by using ‘revised stock units’ (RSUs, the annual energy requirement of a mature ewe to raise a single lamb to weaning; 6000 MJ metabolisable energy). The RSUs for several common equine stock classes are not yet available, while those currently available within the model are based on the linear scaling of feed demand to liveweight, which does not consider allometric scaling of metabolism to liveweight or the differences in digestive physiology and nutrient metabolism between ruminants and monogastric hindgut fermenters (horses). Aim. To compare the current RSU values used in Overseer® for different equine stock classes, with the equineRSU values calculated using equine-specific models. Methods. Weighted average estimates of the bodyweight for the different equine livestock classes were calculated from the published literature. These weighted average estimates of bodyweight were used to estimate the energy requirements on the basis of data published by National Research Council. The resulting dry-matter intake and N intake from the equineRSU values and the current RSU values in use within Overseer® were modelled using published data on diet composition, crude protein content and the digestibility of the different feeds offered. Results. The current RSUs in Overseer were 2.5–6.8 units higher than the equineRSU values obtained from the equine-specific models. This overestimation in feed demand resulted in N-intake estimates at an animal level being 52–108% higher than values derived using the equine-specific estimates. Conclusion. The use of RSUs based on linear scaling of feed demand from ruminants on the basis of liveweight overestimates feed demand and N intake in horses. If horses are to be included within nutrient management models, feed demand must be based on published equine data for energy requirements to avoid over-inflation of N excretion. The equineRSUs calculated in this study reduce the risk of over-inflation of N intake and excretion, and subsequently the N leaching estimations. Implication. Failure to accurately model feed demand of horses within nutrient management software would unfairly compromise stocking density and horse management on large commercial breeding farms. The implication for these errors on economic impact and restricted livestock number is greatest for the Thoroughbred breeding industry due to the scale of the operations. © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

ABSTRACT: Radiographs underestimate the extent of bone injury in horses with third carpal bone (C3) fractures (Fx). We aimed to describe bone pathologies identified using computed tomography (CT) and compare the diagnostic value of digital radiography (DR) and CT in horses with C3 Fx. CT images of 15 racehorses with C3 Fx and 10 controls were reviewed (Part 1) then DR and CT images of 26 racehorses (24 Thoroughbred, 2 Standardbred) with C3 Fx (Part 2) were evaluated. Agreement on fracture geometry and concomitant bone lesions was tested between DR and CT using the kappa statistic (Part 2). For agreement analysis, 38 limbs were used (27 Fx carpi from 26 horses and 11 contralateral carpi). Intermodality agreement was good for recognition of displacement, fair for comminution, articular surface bone loss and osseous fragmentation, and poor–slight for recognition of whether the Fx was complete, additional fissures and lucencies. CT provides more detailed information than DR regarding bone pathology and fracture configuration in horses with C3 fracture. Correlation of CT findings with clinical information and outcome needs to be explored; however, the more accurate diagnosis possible with CT is likely valuable when deciding on the most appropriate management and for surgical planning. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Healthy adult horses can balance accumulation and dissipation of body heat to maintain their body temperature between 37.5 and 38.5 °C, when they are in their thermoneutral zone (5 to 25 °C). However, under some circumstances, such as following strenuous exercise under hot, or hot and humid conditions, the accumulation of body heat exceeds dissipation and horses can suffer from heat stress. Prolonged or severe heat stress can lead to anhidrosis, heat stroke, or brain damage in the horse. To ameliorate the negative effects of high heat load in the body, early detection of heat stress and immediate human intervention is required to reduce the horse’s elevated body temperature in a timely manner. Body temperature measurement and deviations from the normal range are used to detect heat stress. Rectal temperature is the most commonly used method to monitor body temperature in horses, but other body temperature monitoring technologies, percutaneous thermal sensing microchips or infrared thermometry, are currently being studied for routine monitoring of the body temperature of horses as a more practical alternative. When heat stress is detected, horses can be cooled down by cool water application, air movement over the horse (e.g., fans), or a combination of these. The early detection of heat stress and the use of the most effective cooling methods is important to improve the welfare of heat stressed horses. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In common with other grain legumes, the growth habit in horse gram is one of the domestication-driven adaptive traits. Horse gram exhibits determinate and indeterminate types of growth habits. Determinate genotypes have non-overlapping vegetative and reproductive phases combined with a compact growth habit which enables farmers to produce horse gram in intercropping and multiple cropping systems, a common practice for sustainable agriculture production. Also, synchronous flowering, and pod development and maturity of determinate genotypes enable mechanical harvesting. Empirical studies have indicated a greater grain yield potential of indeterminate compared to determinate genotypes. However, we hypothesize that indeterminate and determinate genotypes do not differ for their grain yield potential if they are in isogenic genetic backgrounds. To test this hypothesis, we compared eight pairs of near isogenic (NI) indeterminate and determinate genotypes for their grain yield potential during two rainy seasons in one location and one rainy season in another location. The eight pairs of NI determinate and indeterminate genotypes differed significantly in each of the three test environments. Indeterminate genotypes produced a greater pod (harvestable) and grain (marketable) yields than their determinate counterparts only in a few genetic backgrounds. These results thus support our hypothesis that determinate genotypes are comparable to indeterminate ones, if not better than the latter.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: Accurate reporting of postoperative complications is paramount to understanding procedural outcomes, comparing procedures and assuring quality improvement. Standardising definitions of complications in equine surgeries will improve the evidence of their outcomes. To this end, we proposed a classification for postoperative complications and applied it to a cohort of 190 horses undergoing emergency laparotomy. Methods: A classification system for postoperative complications in equine surgery was developed. Medical records of horses that underwent equine emergency laparotomy and recovered from anaesthesia were analysed. Reported complications pre-discharge were classified as per the new classification system, and the cost and days of hospitalisation were correlated with the equine postoperative complication score (EPOCS). Results: Of the 190 horses that underwent emergency laparotomy, 14 (7.4%) did not survive to discharge (class 6 complications), and 47 (24.7%) did not develop complications. The remaining horses were classified as follows: 43 (22.6%) had class 1 complications, 30 (15.8%) had class 2, 42 (22%) had class 3, 11 (5.8%) had class 4; and three (1.5%) had class 5. The proposed classification system and EPOCS correlated with the cost and length of hospitalisation. Limitations: This was a single-centre study and the definition of scores was arbitrary. Conclusions: Reporting and grading all complications will help surgeons better understand the patients’ postoperative course, thereby reducing subjective interpretation. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine headshaking syndrome (EHS) is associated with severe headshaking in the absence of an identified external stimulus, which affects welfare of the horse as well as handling and especially rideability. Since EHS mainly occurs under the rider, the aim of this study was to investigate different effects in standardised riding tests. Therefore, riding tests (n = 227) were carried out on 16 horses affected by idiopathic EHS and 12 corresponding control horses in order to compare heart rate, saliva samples, thermographic images as well as rein tension and ethological indicators between the two groups. Statistical analysis was performed using generalised linear mixed models for (1) the heart rate, (2) the rein tension in Newton as well as (3) behaviour based on binary data structure. In particular, the study tested for the presence of headshaking (PoHS) (0 = negative, 1 = positive) and gait (−1: backwards, 0: halt, 1: walk, 2: trot, 3: canter) as well as other fixed effects depending on the model. The saliva samples as well as the thermographic images were evaluated using a mixed model. The heart rate dataset revealed that PoHS has no significant impact on the heart rate (P = 0.58); whereas, it is significantly influenced by gait (P ≤ 0.0001). The rein tension dataset indicated that this is not influenced by PoHS, but a meaningful influence was caused by the equipment used (saddle: P ≤ 0.0001) and environmental influences (wind: P ≤ 0.0001). The results of the behavioural parameters indicate that there is no difference between headshakers and control horses in terms of behaviours that indicate a negative emotional state. No difference was found between headshakers and control horses in the evaluation of saliva samples and thermographic images. Wearing a nose cover significantly reduced headshaking symptoms (head flicking: P ≤ 0.05). In summary, no connection of PoHS with the heart rate, increased cortisol levels and thermographic images as well as rein tension could be proven. Thus, it can be concluded that riding has a negligible effect on EHS. Using a nose cover leads to a reduction in frequency of headshaking movements. This study is a first step to investigate the influence of riding on horses affected by EHS and, in general, contributes to a better understanding of EHS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Before the genomics era, heritability estimates were performed using pedigree data. Data collection for pedigree analysis is time consuming and holds the risk of incorrect or incomplete data. With the availability of SNP-based arrays, heritability can now be estimated based on genotyping data. We used SNP array and 1.6 million imputed genotype data with different minor allele frequency restrictions to estimate heritabilities for osteochondrosis dissecans in the fetlock, hock and stifle joints of 446 Hanoverian warmblood horses. SNP-based heritabilities were estimated using a genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) method and accounting for patterns of regional linkage disequilibrium in the equine genome. In addition, we employed GREML for family data to account for different degrees of relatedness in the study population. Our results indicate that we were able to capture a larger proportion of additive genetic variance compared to pedigree-based estimates in the same population of Hanoverian horses. Heritability estimates on the linear scale for fetlock-, hock- and stifle-osteochondrosis dissecans were 0.41–0.43, 0.62–0.63, and 0.23–0.25, respectively, with standard errors of 0.11–0.14. Accounting for linkage disequilibrium patterns had an upward effect on the imputed data and a downward impact on the SNP array genotype data. GREML for family data resulted in higher heritability estimates for fetlock-osteochondrosis dissecans and slightly higher estimates for hock-osteochondrosis dissecans, but had no effect on stifle-osteochondrosis dissecans. The largest and most consistent heritability estimates were obtained when we employed GREML for family data with genomic relationship matrices weighted through patterns of regional linkage disequilibrium. Estimation of SNP-based heritability should be recommended for traits that can only be phenotyped in smaller samples or are cost-effective. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: To date, there is no official method for measuring horse welfare after transport. This study aimed to develop a scale to classify horses into four categories: good shape; light affected; affected; down (GLAD) based on their welfare impairment measured at unloading. To this end, 15 animal-based measures (ABMs), previously recorded from 1019 horses, were scored. Weight and severity scores provided by welfare experts, alongside the number of welfare principles highlighted by the ABM, were assigned to each ABM. The welfare impairment (S) of each horse was then calculated as the weighted sum of the severity scores of the 15 ABMs. Three thresholds were also set to define the four GLAD categories; the ABM “down” (i.e., horses unable to stand and walk on arrival, also considered by the law as the indicator of the worst welfare) was used as the higher threshold, Sdown, (category D); the intermediate threshold, S2, was defined by the ABM “injuries”, assumed to represent highly impaired welfare (category A); the threshold, S1, was defined assuming that significant welfare impairment starts from 20% of S2 (L category). Horses with an S value below S1 were considered physically and mentally fit (G category). Out of 1019, 43% of horses fell into category G, 48% into L, 9% into A, and 0.3% into D. Our scale could be useful for veterinarians to decide whether a horse can be slaughtered immediately (G), needs rest (L), needs attention (A), or euthanasia (D), but further validation is needed. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the prevalence and severity of radiographic abnormalities of the interspinous spaces (ISSs) in the thoracolumbar vertebral column of unbroken yearlings and to compare these findings with a group of older trained Thoroughbred horses without perceived back pain. ANIMALS Yearlings (n = 47) and trained horses (55); 102 total. PROCEDURES Each horse underwent a digital radiographic study of the thoracolumbar vertebral column (T7–L3) and each space graded for narrowing of the ISSs, increased opacity, radiolucency, and modeling of the cranial and caudal margins of 2 contiguous dorsal spinous processes (DSPs). This generated both an individual anatomical space score for each space and a total score for each horse for subsequent comparison. Statistical analysis of the results was then undertaken. RESULTS Narrowing and impingement were detected in a third of the examined ISSs, while DSP increased opacity, radiolucencies, and modeling were found in over half of the yearlings. The median total score per horse was 33 (0 to 96) in the yearlings and 30 (0 to 101) in trained horses, indicating no significant difference in radiographic abnormalities (P = .91). Likewise, the median total score per anatomical space was 112 (25 to 259) and 127.5 (24 to 284) in the yearlings and trained horses (P = .83). No differences were found between the groups for number of radiographic abnormalities, scores, and total score. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study reported the incidence of DSP radiographic abnormalities in Thoroughbred horses. The absence of difference in occurrence between yearlings and older horses supported a developmental rather than acquired etiology. © 2023 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: In 2021, in response to an acknowledged need for universal, consistent ethics to guide decision making in the horse sport sector, Campbell published a theoretical ethical framework for the use of horses in competitive sport. The research reported here tested the applied usefulness of that theoretical ethical framework through stakeholder engagement in a three-round modified Delphi study and refined it to develop a practical decision-making tool which can be applied consistently across multiple equestrian disciplines. Stakeholders from a broad range of equestrian competitive disciplines participated in the research. Participants were required to apply the ethical framework to a pre-determined ethical dilemma, individually (Rounds 1 and 2) and within a group (Round 3), and at the end of each round to complete a questionnaire designed to gauge opinion and user experience. At the completion of each round of testing, the theoretical framework was refined based on stakeholder feedback. Results showed that participants perceived useability and application of the framework to generally increase with each round. Qualitative content analysis identified key concepts, including cognition (e.g., broadens/deepens thinking) and application (e.g., considers multiple angles from a variety of information sources, needs to be a short/simple process). Results suggested that the refined framework is beneficial for group decision making across a wide variety of ethical issues and equestrian competitive disciplines. The framework thus has the potential to improve equine welfare through facilitating consistent ethical decision making in which the interests of the horse are prioritized. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug, which presents an established clinical efficacy in human patients for the management of refractory partial seizures, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and for the control of chronic neuropathic pain. Gabapentin was synthesized as a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, with GABA-mimetic effects, able to cross the blood–brain barrier. In veterinary medicine, is extra-label used in combination with other treatments to control seizures when other drugs are no longer effective or become toxic or for neuropathic pain treatment and anxiety. This review aimed to clarify gabapentin use and pharmacokinetic aspects to promote conscious use in dogs, cats, and horses. In dogs, gabapentin was beneficial in the treatment of epilepsy, as well as chronic, neuropathic, and post-operative pain, as well as anxiety. In cats, it showed efficacy in post-ovariohysterectomy-related pain and in anxiety management. In horses, gabapentin has been administered as an analgesic for chronic pain management. In conclusion, when used in combination with other drugs, gabapentin can be considered an interesting therapeutic option for the treatment of neuropathic diseases and analgesia in postoperative and chronic pain. However, despite its beneficial use in different clinical settings, further trials and pharmacokinetic studies are needed for the definition of an effective dosage regimen through proper pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlation in dogs, cats, and horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Hyperinsulinaemia-associated laminitis (HAL) is encountered commonly in equine practice. There are currently no registered medications which specifically target hyperinsulinaemia in horses and ponies. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been demonstrated to limit post-prandial insulin responses and prevent the development of diet-induced laminitis. Objectives: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of an SGLT2i, ertugliflozin, in the management of hyperinsulinaemia and laminitis. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Medical records of 51 horses and ponies that had presented with laminitis and hyperinsulinaemia and had been treated with oral ertugliflozin at 0.05 mg/kg once daily for a minimum of 30 days were reviewed. Results: After 30 days of treatment with ertugliflozin, there was a reduction in insulin concentrations from a median of >300 μu/ml (IQR: 149, >300) to 43 μu/ml (IQR: 20, 66) (p < 0.001). Modified Obel laminitis scores improved, reducing from a median of 10/12 to 1/12 (p < 0.001). Median serum triglyceride concentrations increased from 0.6 (IQR: 0.4, 0.9) before treatment to 1.4 (IQR: 0.8, 3.7) mmol/L after 30 days of treatment (p < 0.001) before declining, however, none of the horses developed any clinical signs of hyperlipaemia. Ten horses (19%) were reported to have polyuria and polydipsia during treatment, otherwise no adverse clinical effects were identified. Main limitations: The study was limited by the absence of a control group, the retrospective data collection and the short period of follow-up. Conclusions: Ertugliflozin may be effective in reducing insulin concentrations in horses and ponies with equine metabolic syndrome and its use may hasten recovery from laminitis associated with hyperinsulinaemia. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine Herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) typically causes mild respiratory disease, but it can also cause late-term abortion, neonatal foal death and neurologic disease. Once a horse is infected, the virus concentrates to local lymphoid tissue, where it becomes latent. The virus can be reactivated during times of stress, which can lead to the initiation of devastating outbreaks. Understanding the carriage rate of latent EHV-1 in different geographic regions is essential for managing the disease. The objective of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of latent EHV-1 and compare the frequency of each variant in the submandibular lymph nodes of horses in Virginia. Sixty-three submandibular lymph nodes were collected post-partem from horses submitted to regional labs for necropsy, and qPCR was performed. All samples were negative for the gB gene of EHV-1. The results demonstrated a low apparent prevalence of latent EHV-1 DNA in submandibular lymph nodes in this population of horses in Virginia. Despite this, the mainstay for outbreak prevention and mitigation continues to focus on minimizing risks and using appropriate and diligent biosecurity. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The tissue expansion technique is one of the most important innovations in skin reconstructive surgery in human and veterinary medicine. This study investigated horses’ physiological and behavioural responses to subcutaneous implantation of a unidirectional self-inflating anisotropic tissue expander. The tissue expanders were subcutaneously implanted on six horses at three different locations: the frontal region of the head, the lateral side of the right shoulder, and the dorsomedial part of the cannon region of the right forelimb. Prior to the tissue expander implantation, each horse was clinically examined, and the observed vital parameters and behaviour were recorded as baseline data. For six days post implantations, the horses were clinically examined, implantation sites monitored, and the horse’s behaviour was recorded both during the day by visual observation and at night with a video camera. The results showed that all horses tolerated the subcutaneous gradual skin expansion by implantation of the tissue expanders, and all surgical sites healed without any complications. The implantation of the tissue expanders does not affect the vital parameters or overall horse behaviour either during the day or at night. In conclusion, the subcutaneous implantation of unidirectional anisotropic tissue expanders in horses resulted in successful skin growth with no physiological and psychological discomfort; hence skin expansion is a good option to be considered when pursuing equine skin reconstructive surgery. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

ABSTRACT: There is an increased understanding of shared human–animal risk in terms of “one welfare”, whereby when animals are at risk, so are people, so preventing injury to one species may also prevent injury to the other. Because transport-related injuries to horses are common, the authors considered this paradigm to study road equine transport-related injuries to humans in New Zealand. The aim was to determine their frequency and associated factors by distributing a survey to horse industry participants through industry organisations asking about their horse activities, road transport experiences, and any related self-injury. There were 112/1067 (10.5%) handlers injured while preparing (13/112), loading (39/112), traveling (6/112), or unloading (33/112). Of these, 40% had multiple injury types, and 33% had several body regions affected. Hand injuries were most common (46%), followed by the foot (25%), arm (17%), and head or face (15%). Median recovery time was 7 days. Injuries were associated with the responder’s industry educational background, years of driving experience, and reporting a horse injured during road transport in the past two years. Wearing helmets and gloves, and adopting strategies designed to eliminate equine injuries associated with the road transport of horses to reduce the risk of injury to their handlers are recommended. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Skin closure of laparotomy incisions using topical 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (2-OCA) mesh provides a secure bactericidal barrier in humans, which may reduce the risk of postoperative incisional complications. However, the benefits of using this mesh have not been objectively assessed in horses. Methods: From 2009 to 2020, three methods of skin closure were used following laparotomy for acute colic, including metallic staples (MS), suture (ST) and cyanoacrylate mesh (DP). The closure method was not randomised. Owners were contacted 3 months or more after the surgery to record any postoperative complications that occurred. For each method of closure, the rates of surgical site infection (SSI) and herniation were recorded, as well as surgical time and treatment costs, including those for incisional complications. Chi-square testing and logistic regression modelling were used to assess differences between the groups. Results: A total of 110 horses were recruited (45 in the DP group, 49 in the MS group and 16 in the ST group) The overall rate of SSI was 15.5%, with rates of 8.9%, 18.4% and 25% for the DP, MS and ST groups, respectively (p = 0.23). In addition, incisional hernias developed in 21.8% of cases, with 8.9%, 34.7% and 18.8% of horses in the DP, MS and ST groups, respectively, being affected (p = 0.009). The median total treatment cost did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.47). Limitation: This was a retrospective study with non-randomised choice of closure method. Conclusions: No significant differences in the rate of SSI or overall cost wwere demonstrated between treatment groups. However, MS was associated with a higher rate of hernia formation than DP or ST. Despite increased capital cost, 2-OCA proved to be a safe skin closure method in horses and was no more expensive than DP or ST by the time visits to remove sutures/staples and treat infections were factored in. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: From previous studies, the International Society for Equitation Science has advised that further research be conducted on the physiological/psychological effects of less-exacerbated poll flexion angles. We aimed to evaluate the effects of two riding poll flexion positions with a difference of only 15° on the respiratory systems and behaviour of horses through an evaluation of dynamic airway collapse via over-ground endoscopy, the pharyngeal diameter, pleural pressure, arterial oxygenation and lactate, HR/RR, and the occurrence of conflict behaviours. Twenty high-level dressage and twenty show-jumping horses underwent a 40 min ridden test at a ground angle of 85°; 3 weeks later, they underwent a ridden test at a 100° ground angle (the angle between the ground and the line from the forehead to the muzzle) and in a cross-over design. Using a mixed model for repeated measures, Wilcoxon/Friedman tests were carried out according to the experimental design and/or error normality. For both groups, at 100°, conflict behaviours and upper airway tract abnormalities were significantly more frequent, and the pleural pressure was higher, and the pharyngeal diameter was lower. At 85°, relaxation behaviours were significantly more frequent. Lactate was significantly higher at 100° only in the dressage horses. Compared to the first test at 85°, the HR/RR were significantly lower at the beginning of the second test (at 100°) but higher at the end. The significant differences identified in these dressage and show-jumping horses support the idea that an increase of just 15° in riding poll flexion can have negative effects on the respiratory system and behaviour of a horse and therefore on its welfare. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Increased antimicrobial resistance highlights the need for alternatives to antibiotics. Bacteriophages, which are benign viruses that kill bacteria, are promising. We studied the efficacy of topical bacteriophages for treating equine staphylococcal superficial pyodermas. Eight Staphylococcus aureus isolates were tested against a bacteriophage bank, and a cocktail consisting of two bacteriophages was prepared. Twenty horses with clinical and cytological evidence of superficial pyoderma and confirmed S. aureus infection based on swabbed culture were enrolled in the study. Each horse received both the bacteriophage cocktail and the placebo at two different infection sites, once daily for four weeks. Clinical lesions and cytology were evaluated weekly by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment sites. All infection sites were swabbed and cultured at the end of the study. A linear mixed model showed no significant differences between the placebo and treatment sites in terms of clinical signs, cytological scores of inflammation, and bacterial counts at the end of the study. It is possible that the bacteriophage cocktail killed S. aureus, but cytology scores did not change as new populations of cocci took over. The study limitations included a small sample size and inconsistent control of the underlying causes of pyodermas. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Quantitative information on how well a horse clears a jump has great potential to support the rider in improving the horse’s jumping performance. This study investigated the validation of a GPS-based inertial measurement unit, namely Alogo Move Pro, compared with a traditional optical motion capture system. Accuracy and precision of the three jumping characteristics of maximum height (Zmax), stride/jump length (lhorz), and mean horizontal speed (vhorz) were compared. Eleven horse–rider pairs repeated two identical jumps (an upright and an oxer fence) several times (n = 6 to 10) at different heights in a 20 × 60 m tent arena. The ground was a fiber sand surface. The 24 OMC (Oqus 7+, Qualisys) cameras were rigged on aluminum rails suspended 3 m above the ground. The Alogo sensor was placed in a pocket on the protective plate of the saddle girth. Reflective markers placed on and around the Alogo sensor were used to define a rigid body for kinematic analysis. The Alogo sensor data were collected and processed using the Alogo proprietary software; stride-matched OMC data were collected using Qualisys Track Manager and post-processed in Python. Residual analysis and Bland–Altman plots were performed in Python. The Alogo sensor provided measures with relative accuracy in the range of 10.5–20.7% for stride segments and 5.5–29.2% for jump segments. Regarding relative precision, we obtained values in the range of 6.3–14.5% for stride segments and 2.8–18.2% for jump segments. These accuracy differences were deemed good under field study conditions where GPS signal strength might have been suboptimal. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study compared muscle activity and movement between the leading (Ld) and trailing (Tr) fore- (F) and hindlimbs (H) of horses cantering overground. Three-dimensional kinematic and surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected from right triceps brachii, biceps femoris, middle gluteal, and splenius from 10 ridden horses during straight left- and right-lead canter. Statistical parametric mapping evaluated between-limb (LdF vs. TrF, LdH vs. TrH) differences in time- and amplitude-normalized sEMG and joint angle–time waveforms over the stride. Linear mixed models evaluated between-limb differences in discrete sEMG activation timings, average rectified values (ARV), and spatio-temporal kinematics. Significantly greater gluteal ARV and activity duration facilitated greater limb retraction, hip extension, and stifle flexion (p < 0.05) in the TrH during stance. Earlier splenius activation during the LdF movement cycle (p < 0.05), reflected bilateral activation during TrF/LdH diagonal stance, contributing to body pitching mechanisms in canter. Limb muscles were generally quiescent during swing, where significantly greater LdF/H protraction was observed through greater elbow and hip flexion (p < 0.05), respectively. Alterations in muscle activation facilitate different timing and movement cycles of the leading and trailing limbs, which justifies equal training on both canter leads to develop symmetry in muscular strength, enhance athletic performance, and mitigate overuse injury risks. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is a highly prevalent and presumptively painful condition, although the amount of pain horses might experience is currently unknown. The aims of this study were to determine if the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) could identify pain behaviours in horses with and without EGUS and if severity would be positively associated with the HGS score. Horse grimace scale scores were assessed blindly using facial photographs by seven observers and involved evaluation of 6 facial action units as 0 (not present), 1 (moderately present) and 2 (obviously present). Lameness examination, serum amyloid A (SAA) measurement and gastroscopy evaluation were performed on all horses. Horses (n = 61) were divided into two and three groups based on the presence (yes, no) and severity (none, mild, moderate-severe) of EGUS, respectively. Presence of lameness and elevated SAA (≥50 µg/mL) were used as exclusion criteria. Inter-observer reliability was analyzed by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). HGS scores between groups were compared using Welch’s and Brown Forsythe tests (p < 0.05). Overall, HGS ICC was “excellent” (0.75). No significant differences (p = 0.566) were observed in HGS scores between horses with and without gastric lesions (mean, 95% CI; 3.36, 2.76–3.95 and 3, 1.79–4.20, respectively). HGS was not influenced by the presence or severity of EGUS in this current study. Further studies investigating the use of different pain scales in horses with EGUS are needed. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This paper aimed to study the value of horse manure through anaerobic digestion. The study involved characterization of different components of horse waste and the evaluation of their biochemical composition, physicochemical characterization and the influence of the composition of horse waste on biochemical methane potential. More specifically, two bedding mixtures were studied: the first one was composed of wheat straw (WS), wood chips (WC) and horse manure (HM) with a volumetric composition of 85%, 14% and 1%, respectively; and the second one was a mixture of WS and HM with a volumetric composition of 99% and 1%, respectively. The analysis was carried out on the two bedding mixtures and on each substrate separately with 406 samples from May 2017 to October 2019. Biochemical methane potential tests conducted on these samples showed that the composition and structure of the substrate influenced the BMP. WS had the highest mono-digestion methane production with 176.1 NmL·gVS−1. The second bedding mixture (99% WS, 1% HM) showed a production of 189.4 NmL·gVS−1 compared to 127 NmL·gVS−1 by bedding mixture 1 (85% WS, 14% WC, 1% HM). The difference was due to a dilution effect on methane production caused by the presence of WC rich in lignin. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Pruritus in the horse may be due to several causes, the most common being a hypersensitivity response to salivary proteins in the Culicoides genera, which may coexist with atopic dermatitis, also known as an environmental allergy to pollens, molds, dust, storage mites, etc. Less common etiologies are food allergy and contact allergy, the latter often caused by owners applying various products to the skin. Other ectoparasites, such as Chorioptes mites, may also initiate pruritus. Secondary bacterial infections (usually Staphylococcus spp) may be pruritic in and of themselves. This article reviews the questions that need to be asked of owners to obtain a relevant history, always important for any organ system, but perhaps none more so than the skin. The various clinical findings such as alopecia and crusts and their location on the horse, diagnostic methods such as intradermal or serum testing for allergies, and subsequent hyposensitization are also discussed. Therapeutic options currently available for the potential underlying diseases, in particular for the hypersensitivity reactions to Culicoides spp or environmental allergens, are reviewed with the studies of hyposensitization over the last 40 years, as well as medications that may be effective. While the most common causes of pruritus in the horse are known, the current understanding of the pathophysiology still needs to be investigated, and consequently, the most effective treatments for those causes need to be improved. Newer research is discussed that may eventually add to the diagnostic and therapeutic options currently available for the pruritic horse. © 2023 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The cloning of horses is a commercial reality, yet the availability of oocytes for cloned embryo production remains a major limitation. Immature oocytes collected from abattoir-sourced ovaries or from live mares by ovum pick-up (OPU) have both been used to generate cloned foals. However, the reported cloning efficiencies are difficult to compare due to the different somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) techniques and conditions used. The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the in vitro and in vivo development of equine SCNT embryos produced using oocytes recovered from abattoir-sourced ovaries and from live mares by OPU. A total of 1,128 oocytes were obtained, of which 668 were abattoir-derived and 460 were OPU-derived. The methods used for in vitro maturation and SCNT were identical for both oocyte groups, and the embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Embryo development in vitro was assessed, and Day 7 blastocysts were transferred to recipient mares. The embryos were transferred fresh when possible, and a cohort of vitrified-thawed OPU-derived blastocysts was also transferred. Pregnancy outcomes were recorded at Days 14, 42 and 90 of gestation and at foaling. The rates of cleavage (68.7 ± 3.9% vs 62.4 ± 4.7%) and development to the blastocyst stage (34.6 ± 3.3% vs 25.6 ± 2.0%) were superior for OPU-derived embryos compared with abattoir-derived embryos (P < 0.05). Following transfer of Day 7 blastocysts to a total of 77 recipient mares, the pregnancy rates at Days 14 and 42 of gestation were 37.7% and 27.3%, respectively. Beyond Day 42, the percentages of recipient mares that still had a viable conceptus at Day 90 (84.6% vs 37.5%) and gave birth to a healthy foal (61.5% vs 12.5%) were greater for the OPU group compared with the abattoir group (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, more favourable pregnancy outcomes were achieved when blastocysts were vitrified for later transfer, probably because the uterine receptivity of the recipient mares was more ideal. A total of 12 cloned foals were born, 9 of which were viable. Given the differences observed between the two oocyte groups, the use of OPU-harvested oocytes for generating cloned foals is clearly advantageous. Continued research is essential to better understand the oocyte deficiencies and increase the efficiency of equine cloning. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Facial swellings are a common presenting sign in horses and can have many causes. Some swellings can be caused by significant disorders such as sinus cysts, sinonasal neoplasia or dental abscessation, which require immediate diagnosis and treatment. However, facial swellings similar to some of these disorders may also be caused by facial suturitis and these may cause great concern to some horse owners. Aim of the article: This article describes the anatomy of the equine facial sutures and explains the known causes and the clinical and ancillary diagnostic findings of equine facial suturitis, so that practitioners can confidently make a diagnosis and advise clients of its usually innocuous nature. Management of cases with suture infections is also described. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and oxidative stress, which is involved in neuronal damage through various pathways, is considered to be a central part of AD pathogenesis. Therefore, we took advantage of the blood–brain barrier permeability of biogenic extracellular vesicles to load the high-performance antioxidant resveratrol (Res) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles with multiple enzymatic activities into the extracellular vesicles and then deliver the ‘Trojan horses’ to the central nervous system to exert synergistic antioxidant effects. In this study, Res-Pt@EVs-RVG was designed to preferentially target the brain using rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptides. In addition, the large photothermal effect of Pt nanoparticles increased the drug penetration and its high blood–brain barrier penetration ability was confirmed in vivo animal experiments. We found through multiple experiments that Res-Pt@EVs-RVG was well absorbed by cells, reduced intracellular reactive oxygen levels, improved mitochondrial damage, and attenuated glial cell activation while reducing neuronal loss in the brains of AD mice and improving memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Our results suggest that a biogenic extracellular vesicles-based drug delivery strategy overcomes the disadvantage of poor drug penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) and provides a potential platform for the effective treatment of AD. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Neuro- and nephrotoxicity of polymyxins are known but clinical studies in horses are lacking. The aim of this study was to describe neurogenic and nephrogenic side effects of hospitalized horses receiving Polymyxin B (PolyB) as part of their treatment plan. Twenty horses diagnosed with surgical colic (n = 11), peritonitis (n = 5), typhlocolitis (n = 2), pneumonia, and pyometra (each n = 1) were included. Antimicrobial treatment was randomized to GENTA (gentamicin 10 mg/kg bwt q24 h IV, penicillin 30.000 IU/kg q6 h IV) or NO GENTA (marbofloxacin 2 mg/kg bwt q24 h IV, penicillin 30.000 IU/kg q6 h IV). The duration of PolyB treatment ranged from 1 to 4 days. Clinical and neurological examinations were performed, and serum PolyB concentrations were measured daily during and three days following PolyB treatment. Urinary analysis, plasma creatinine, urea and SDMA were assessed every other day. Video recordings of neurological examinations were graded by three blinded observers. All horses showed ataxia during PolyB treatment in both groups (median maximum ataxia score of 3/5, range 1–3/5). Weakness was detected in 15/20 (75%) horses. In 8/14 horses, the urinary γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT)/creatinine ratio was elevated. Plasma creatinine was mildly elevated in 1/16 horses, and SDMA in 2/10 horses. Mixed-model analysis showed a significant effect of time since last PolyB dose (p = 0.0001, proportional odds: 0.94) on the ataxia score. Ataxia and weakness should be considered as reversible adverse effects in hospitalized horses receiving PolyB. Signs of tubular damage occurred in a considerable number of horses; therefore, the nephrotoxic effect of polymyxins should be considered and urinary function monitored. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin that is increased in osteoarthritic joints of horses. In humans, NGF has been associated with pain, and both synovial and serum NGF concentrations are increased in osteoarthritic patients. Studies in humans also have shown that serum NGF concentration can increase with stress. Serum NGF concentration should be evaluated in horses with osteoarthritis-associated lameness. Objectives: Quantify and compare serum NGF concentration in horses with osteoarthritis-associated lameness and sound horses. Additionally, the impact of short-term stress on serum NGF concentration was investigated. Animals: Lame horses with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (n = 20), lame horses without radiographic changes in the affected joint (n = 20) and sound horses (n = 20). In addition, horses with acute fractures (n = 9) were sampled. To determine the effect of stress, serum from horses subjected to a stressful event (transportation, n = 5; stress confirmed by increased serum cortisol concentration) was analyzed. Methods: Cross-sectional clinical study (lame, sound, and fracture cohorts) and experimental longitudinal study (stress cohort). Serum NGF concentration was determined using a quantitative sandwich ELISA. Results: Serum NGF concentration was increased in lame horses with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (P <.0001; median, 238 pg/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 63-945 pg/mL) and in lame horses without radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis in the painful joint (P <.05; median, 31 pg/mL; IQR, 31-95 pg/mL) compared with sound horses (median, 31 pg/mL; IQR, 31-46 pg/mL). Serum NGF concentration did not increase with short-term stress and was low in horses with fracture-associated pain. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Serum NGF concentration was high in the cohort with advanced osteoarthritis and should be investigated as a marker for osteoarthritis-associated pain. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasound-guided cervical centesis has gained popularity as a method for collecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from standing horses. There are anecdotal reports of neck stiffness, regional swelling, sensitivity to palpation, and fever after the procedure. We report 2 horses with complications that occurred within days of C1-C2 centesis and ultimately resulted in euthanasia. Both C1-C2 centesis were performed routinely, with CSF cytologic analysis providing no evidence of blood contamination. Post-mortem examination revealed equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy as the primary disorder causing Horse 1's initial neurologic deficits, whereas Horse 2 did not have a distinct lesion explaining the horse's deficits. Both horses had evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage at or near the centesis site with Wallerian axonal degeneration in the cranial cervical spinal cord. Although hemorrhage with associated axonal degeneration at the cervical centesis site appears to be rare, this complication of C1-C2 centesis should be considered as this technique gains popularity. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: West Nile virus (WNV) neuroinvasive disease threatens the health and well-being of horses and humans worldwide. Disease in horses and humans is remarkably similar. The occurrence of WNV disease in these mammalian hosts has geographic overlap with shared macroscale and microscale drivers of risk. Importantly, intrahost virus dynamics, the evolution of the antibody response, and clinicopathology are similar. The goal of this review is to provide a comparison of WNV infection in humans and horses and to identify similarities that can be exploited to enhance surveillance methods for the early detection of WNV neuroinvasive disease. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: High elimination rates and concerns for horse welfare are important issues in endurance riding. Improved understanding of the causes of elimination could increase completion rates in this sport. We have identified pre-ride laboratory risk factors that enable an assessment of potential elimination before the ride. A longitudinal cohort study was performed among 49 healthy horses competing in the 160 km endurance ride at the 2016 World Championship of Endurance Riding in Samorin/Slovakia. Blood samples were taken before the event. For statistical evaluation, horses were categorized into three groups: finishers, lame horses, and metabolically eliminated horses. Risk factors were calculated for each group using multinominal logistic regression. δ-Aminolevulinic-dehydratase (ALAD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), iron, and serum amyloid A (SAA) were measured and did not show an impact on the race outcome, but elevated pre-ride superoxide dismutase (SOD) was shown to have an effect on lameness elimination (p = 0.011). It might serve as an indicator for withdrawing horses at risk of later elimination before endurance rides, ultimately resulting in lower elimination rates and an increase in overall horse welfare. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The horse industry is a large industry with a high scope for growth and employment. It encompasses production and nurturing of horses, as well as other activities involving horses. The domestic horse industry in South Korea has shown remarkable growth since the Horse Industry Promotion Act was enacted in 2012. However, research on horse health-care, especially hoof diseases, is insufficient. The most frequent hoof diseases in Korea are thrush, cracks, and white line disease. In this study, we aimed to identify the causative agents of thrush, the most frequent hoof disease among horses in Korea, and perform antibiotic sensitivity tests on the isolates. In 55 samples collected from 47 horses diagnosed with thrush during grooming among 2,973 horses raised in Korea, and the causative agents, Bacillus spp., Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp., Aerococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Clostridium spp., and Aspergillus flavus. However, Fusobacterium necrophorum was not isolated from horses with thrush in Korea. Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility tests for these isolates showed that they were sensitive to most of the 22 antibiotics tested, including amikacin. This is attributable to the fact that the treatment and prevention of thrush is primarily focused on stall and hoof management procedures, such as grooming, and that antibiotics have not been used for treatment. These results are expected to greatly contribute to the treatment of equine hoof diseases, especially thrush, in Korea. Research with more samples can improve our understanding of the relationship between thrush and occurrence of other hoof diseases. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sprint racing performance of Quarter Horses in Brazil. Estimating genetic parameters, trends and correlations were obtained by single- and two-trait analyses using Bayesian inference (earnings to 2 years of equestrian age, best time and time class at distances of 301 m and 402 m). The data comprised a period of 38 equestrian years (1978 to 2015) with 23,482 sprint race records from 5861 animals. The heritability estimates were of low to moderate magnitude, ranging from 0.10 to 0.37 (single-trait) and from 0.15 to 0.41 (two-traits), and the repeatability was 0.31 to 0.46. The additive, residual and phenotypic correlations between earnings to 2 years of equestrian age and the other traits (best time and time class in distances 301 m and 402 m) were high (−0.95, −0.96, 0.69 and 0.92), low (−0.29, −0.37, 0.26 and 0.27) and moderate (−0.41, −0.47, 0.37 and 0.47), respectively. There is a positive genetic trend for all traits considered. However, evaluation of the last 10 equestrian years (2006 to 2015) showed negative trends (genetic loss) and trends close to zero (genetic stagnation). The design of breeding programs using the earnings trait in conjunction with other racing performance traits can enhance changes in the genetic gains as a whole in speed-racing Quarter Horses. These findings suggest that the traits studied should be included in breeding selection programs for racing Quarter Horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Little information is presently available regarding the frequency of the silent shedders of respiratory viruses in healthy sport horses and their impact on environmental contamination. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the detection frequency of selected respiratory pathogens in nasal secretions and environmental stall samples of sport horses attending a multi-week equestrian event during the summer months. Six out of fifteen tents were randomly selected for the study with approximately 20 horse/stall pairs being sampled on a weekly basis. Following weekly collection for a total of 11 weeks, all samples were tested for the presence of common respiratory pathogens (EIV, EHV-1, EHV-4, ERAV, ERBV, and Streptococcus equi ss equi (S. equi)) using qPCR. A total of 19/682 nasal swabs (2.8%) and 28/1288 environmental stall sponges (2.2%) tested qPCR-positive for common respiratory pathogens. ERBV was the most common respiratory virus (17 nasal swabs, 28 stall sponges) detected, followed by EHV-4 (1 nasal swab) and S. equi (1 nasal swab). EIV, EHV-1, EHV-4 and ERAV were not detected in any of the study horses or stalls. Only one horse and one stall tested qPCR-positive for ERBV on two consecutive weeks. All the other qPCR-positive sample results were related to individual time points. Furthermore, only one horse/stall pair tested qPCR-positive for ERBV at a single time point. The study results showed that in a selected population of sport horses attending a multi-week equestrian event in the summer, the frequency of the shedding of respiratory viruses was low and primarily restricted to ERBV with little evidence of active transmission and environmental contamination. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES Evaluation of the strength of the novel suture technique by comparison with a 2-interrupted suture technique. SAMPLE 40 equine larynges. PROCEDURES 40 larynges were used; 16 laryngoplasties were performed using the currently accepted 2-suture technique and 16 using the novel suture technique. These specimens were subjected to a single cycle to failure. Eight specimens were used to compare the rima glottidis area achieved with 2 different techniques. RESULTS The mean force to failure, as well as the rima glottidis area of both constructs, were not significantly different. The cricoid width did not have a significant effect on the force to failure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our results suggest that both constructs are equally strong and can achieve a similar cross-sectional area of the rima glottidis. Laryngoplasty (“tie-back”) is currently the treatment of choice for horses with exercise intolerance due to recurrent laryngeal neuropathy. Failure to maintain the expected degree of arytenoid abduction post-surgery occurs in some horses. We believe this novel 2-loop pulley load-sharing suture technique can help achieve and, more importantly, maintain the desired degree of abduction during surgery. © 2023, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Opioid-free anaesthesia is a growing field in human and veterinary medicine. Several adverse effects have been reported related to the administration of opioids in horses, including the propensity to produce excitement, ataxia and gastrointestinal stasis. However, opioids have traditionally been the mainstay of pain relief in both the human and veterinary field. The feasibility of an opioid-free anaesthesia protocol in a horse that underwent multiple subtotal spinous process ostectomies is reported here. Instead of traditional opioid therapy, a detomidine continuous-rate infusion and a bilateral ultrasound-guided erector spinae block was performed to provide analgesia. The authors concluded that opioid-free surgical anaesthesia protocols may be feasible in horses undergoing multiple subtotal spinous process ostectomies. Gaining experience with these protocols may be advantageous when the use of opioids is to be avoided. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The mental experiences of animals are what characterises their welfare status. The Five Domains Model for assessing welfare aligns with the understanding that physical and mental states are linked. Following measurement of indicators within each of the four physical/functional Domains (1. Nutrition; 2. Physical environment; 3. Health; and 4. Behavioural interactions), the anticipated negative or positive affective consequences (mental experiences) are cautiously inferred and assigned to Domain 5. Those inferences derive credibility from validated knowledge of the underlying systems of physiology, neurophysiology, neuroethology and affective neuroscience. Any indicators used for assessing welfare need to be scientifically validated. This requires, firstly, evidence of the links between a measurable/observable indicator and the physical/functional impact (in Domains 1 to 4), and secondly, a demonstrable relationship between the physical/functional impact and the mental experience it is inferred the indicators reflect (in Domain five). This review refers to indicators of physical/functional states in Domains 1 to 4, which have been shown to be measurable in free-roaming wild horses, and then evaluates the scientific evidence linking them to inferred mental experiences in Domain 5. This is the first time that the scientific evidence validating a comprehensive range of welfare indicators has been synthesised in this way. Inserting these indicators into the Five Domains Model enables transparently justifiable assessment and grading of welfare status in free-roaming horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Several therapies have been developed to treat equine cutaneous melanoma, but formal comparisons among different treatment options are currently unavailable. It was our intent to assess the efficacy of different treatment protocols and the quality of the studies based on the original published data, and summarize the knowledge concerning the outcome after equine cutaneous melanoma management. This structured review followed PRISMA procedure to search for treatment protocols on equine cutaneous melanoma published from 1960 until June 2021. Studies were assessed for the risk of bias. A descriptive analysis was performed, considering the disease control rate, the recurrence rate of the tumor, comorbidities, need for anesthesia, and horses’ welfare. Twenty-three studies were included, from which the treatment outcomes of 173 horses were assessed. The homogeneity of the included trials was low. The percentages of each treatment arm achieving a partial response and curative effects accounted for 93.1% (surgical intervention), 90% (medication), and 39.4% (immunotherapies), respectively. A variable efficacy of different therapies of equine cutaneous melanoma was observed. Surgical intervention performed the best from the perspective of local antitumor effects alone. This literature review and descriptive analysis can serve as a source to assist in designing quality therapy research and can potentially aid in providing a clinical treatment reference for equine cutaneous melanoma. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: An 8-year-old, male, neutered Argentinian polo pony underwent two ocular surgeries due to a fungal abscess. The horse was on treatment with fluconazole before and during the time when the two anaesthetic procedures took place. The only difference between anaesthetic events was the induction agent. During the first anaesthetic procedure, ketamine was used. However, during the second anaesthetic procedure, due to ocular fragility sodium thiopental was preferred to avoid increase in intraocular pressure. The first anaesthetic duration was 130 minutes, and standing was achieved after 20 minutes of isoflurane discontinuation, with no complications. The second anaesthetic procedure lasted for 60 minutes, but standing was not achieved until 70 minutes after isoflurane discontinuation. The horse was ataxic with muscle weakness for 6 hours after standing. However, the horse recovered successfully and was discharged 2 months after the first surgical procedure. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Horizontal expansion of area under pulses at country level has very little possibilities. This necessitates exploring alternate ways to increase the area and production of pulses. Bt cotton is the major cash crop grown in large area in Southern transition zone of Karnataka on red soils. Bt cotton hybrids are sown at wide row spacing hence provide sufficient space for cultivation of short duration pulses like cowpea and horse gram. Methods: On-farm trials were carried out in medium deep red soils of Basavanagiri village of Mysore district, Karnataka during 2014-15 and 2015-16. There were six treatments consists of Bt cotton with farmers practice (T1), Bt cotton with best management practice (T2), sole cowpea (T3), sole horse gram (T4), Bt cotton intercropped with cowpea (T5) and Bt cotton inter cropped with horse gram (T6). On-farm trials were laid out by using RCBD design in five farmer fields, which served as replications. Result: On-farm investigation indicated that there was no much difference between cotton yield sole crop with BMP and inter cropped cotton yield. However, cotton yield was significantly lower in farmers practice over BMP. Intercropping of cowpea and horse gram with Bt cotton resulted in higher cotton equivalent yield, LER and production efficiency over the sole cotton cropping system. This was due to the wider spacing of the cotton and better resource use efficiency in intercropping system. © 2023, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was developed to facilitate the recognition of musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this study was to document changes in RHpE scores before and after diagnostic anaesthesia was performed to alleviate pain ± when the saddle was changed. One hundred and fifty horses underwent ridden exercise as part of an investigation of poor performance. The RHpE was applied before and after the interventions. Fifty-two (34.7%) horses exhibited a bilaterally symmetrical short step length and/or restricted hindlimb impulsion and engagement. Fifty-three (35.3%) horses had episodic lameness; only forty-five (30.0%) horses were continuously lame. The median maximum lameness grade when ridden was 2/8 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0–3; range: 0–4). Fifty-six (37.3%) horses had an ill-fitting saddle, which was considered likely to influence performance. The median RHpE scores after the interventions (2/24 [IQR: 1–3, range: 0–12]) were significantly lower than before the interventions (9/24 [IQR: 8–11, range: 2–15]) (Wilcoxon signed-rank z = 10.6, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between the RHpE score and maximum lameness grade before diagnostic anaesthesia (Spearman’s rho = 0.09, p = 0.262). It was concluded that the absence of overt lameness does not preclude primary musculoskeletal pain. Gait quality and performance can be improved by diagnostic anaesthesia, with substantial reductions in RHpE scores. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Excessive dietary salt intake is associated with the development of hypertension, causing millions of deaths around the world annually. Meanwhile, food insecurity caused by rapid growth of global population has drawn researchers’ interest in exploiting underutilized legumes as food resources. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop a novel sodium-reduced condiment from a neglected legume, horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum). Different formulations of fermented horse gram condiment (FHGC) were developed by gradual reduction of NaCl content. Nutritional composition and quality parameters of FHGC were assessed in present study. The results showed that amino acid nitrogen content and free amino acid content were both inversely related to NaCl concentration of FHGC. Sensory test conducted revealed that FHGC-12 had the highest consumer acceptability. However, penalty analysis suggested that saltiness was a less significant factor in affecting consumer liking of FHGC. Optimizing the balance of umami, sweet and bitter taste amino acids, in conjunction with NaCl is crucial in affecting acceptability of FHGC, rather than having the highest quantity ratio of amino acids. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain a well-balanced ratio of these key taste components to enhance consumer acceptance of FHGC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Equine primary hyperparathyroidism is rare compared with the condition in human medicine where it is often encountered and represents the most common explanation for hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Primary hyperparathyroidism results from a hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland and surgical treatment (parathyroidectomy) is typically curative. Successful surgical removal of a diseased parathyroid gland can be challenging in horses as both normal and hyperfunctioning glands are difficult to localise. Identification of surgical targets using ultrasonography and/or Technetium-99 m sestimibi scintigraphy are useful for this purpose in both the human and equine contexts. However, these localisation approaches are not always effective. Moreover, not all patients are candidates for general anaesthesia and surgery and the costs associated with diagnostic localisation and parathyroidectomy may be prohibitive for some owners. This commentary presents information about primary hyperparathyroidism in the event that it is not treated and strives to review aspects of the disease when left untreated from the human medical context. © 2023 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Adipose tissue is recognized as the major endocrine organ, potentially acting as a source of mesenchymal stem cells for various applications in regenerative medicine. Athletic horses are often exposed to traumatic injuries, resulting in severe financial losses. The development of adipose-derived stem cells’ regenerative potential depends on many factors. The extraction of stem cells from subcutaneous adipose tissue is non-invasive, non-traumatic, cheaper, and safer than other sources. Since there is a lack of unique standards for identification, the isolated cells and applied differentiation protocols are often not species-specific; therefore, the cells cannot reveal their multipotent properties, so their stemness features remain questionable. The current review discusses some aspects of the specificity of equine adipose stem cells concerning their features, immunophenotyping, secretome profile, differentiation abilities, culturing conditions, and consequent possibilities for clinical application in concrete disorders. The presented new approaches elucidate the possibility of the transition from cell-based to cell-free therapy with regenerative purposes in horses as an alternative treatment to cellular therapy. In conclusion, their clinical benefits should not be underestimated due to the higher yield and the physiological properties of adipose-derived stem cells that facilitate the healing and tissue regeneration process and the ability to amplify the effects of traditional treatments. More profound studies are necessary to apply these innovative approaches when treating traumatic disorders in racing horses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The determination of iCa and iMg is important in veterinary medicine, but their immediate determination in whole blood is not always possible. Their stability in other sample types and the existence of interferences must be evaluated before its use. Objectives: We aimed to analyze the effects of storage time on the stability of iCa, iMg, and other analytes in whole blood, plasma, and serum samples in horses and assess the interference of heparin in these measurements. Methods: Whole blood, heparin-plasma, and serum samples from 10 horses were stored at 4°C and analyzed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 24, 48, and 168 hours after sample collection using the Stat Profile Prime Plus Vet equipment (Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA). Results were analyzed by ANOVA or mixed-effect models. Results: The concentration of iCa, iMg, total calcium (tCa), total magnesium (tMg), and the ratios iCa/tCa and iMg/tMg did not differ up to 168 hours when compared to the initial time. Total Ca, iMg, and tMg were not significantly different among sample types, but iCa concentrations were slightly but significantly lower in plasma. Freezing at −20°C did not affect iCa, iMg, tCa, and tMg. The pH increased in serum and plasma after 8 hours, and a mild negative correlation existed between plasma iCa concentration and pH. A negative correlation was observed also between the ratios iCa/tCa or iMg/tMg and pH in plasma and serum. A significant decrease in iCa and iMg was detected when comparing homemade syringes at high heparin concentration (~200–300 U heparin/mL) and commercial lithium-heparin tubes (20–30 U/mL). Conclusions: Samples stored at 4°C can be used to determine iCa and iMg concentrations up to 7 days after collection. Other metabolites are stable for up to 8 hours; heparin interference should be taken into account if using homemade heparin syringes. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) remains the method of choice for establishing the efficacy of anthelmintic compounds in the field, including the diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance. We present a guideline for improving the standardization and performance of the FECRT that has four sections. In the first section, we address the major issues relevant to experimental design, choice of faecal egg count (FEC) method, statistical analysis, and interpretation of the FECRT results. In the second section, we make a series of general recommendations that are applicable across all animals addressed in this guideline. In the third section, we provide separate guidance details for cattle, small ruminants (sheep and goats), horses and pigs to address the issues that are specific to the different animal types. Finally, we provide overviews of the specific details required to conduct an FECRT for each of the different host species. To address the issues of statistical power vs. practicality, we also provide two separate options for each animal species; (i) a version designed to detect small changes in efficacy that is intended for use in scientific studies, and (ii) a less resource-intensive version intended for routine use by veterinarians and livestock owners to detect larger changes in efficacy. Compared to the previous FECRT recommendations, four important differences are noted. First, it is now generally recommended to perform the FECRT based on pre- and post-treatment FEC of the same animals (paired study design), rather than on post-treatment FEC of both treated and untreated (control) animals (unpaired study design). Second, instead of requiring a minimum mean FEC (expressed in eggs per gram (EPG)) of the group to be tested, the new requirement is for a minimum total number of eggs to be counted under the microscope (cumulative number of eggs counted before the application of a conversion factor). Third, we provide flexibility in the required size of the treatment group by presenting three separate options that depend on the (expected) number of eggs counted. Finally, these guidelines address all major livestock species, and the thresholds for defining reduced efficacy are adapted and aligned to host species, anthelmintic drug and parasite species. In conclusion, these new guidelines provide improved methodology and standardization of the FECRT for all major livestock species. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Urolithiasis is an uncommon disorder reported in horses. Calculi located in the kidneys and ureters are often underdiagnosed. Associated clinical signs include weight loss, anorexia, haematuria, dysuria, colic and polyuria/polydipsia. A 26-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was referred for evaluation of an acute colic episode of 5-hour duration. Haematologic analysis revealed increased serum creatine kinase and creatinine concentrations. Abdominocentesis yielded serosanguineous, mildly cloudy fluid with a lactate of 9.6 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). Exploratory laparotomy was recommended. Surgical intervention was declined, and the horse was humanely euthanased. Limited postmortem evaluation was performed. A 3.633 kg nephrolith measuring 23.6 × 16.2 × 8.9 cm was completely effacing the left kidney. Crystallography and infrared spectroscopy (attenuated total reflection and Fourier transform infrared) revealed a 100% calcium carbonate nephrolith. Carbonate calcium calculi are the most common subtype in horses. Nephrolithiasis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for colic and haematologic evidence of azotaemia in horses. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Preliminary evidence supports a role for IL-31 in equine insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) and pruritus. Our studies investigated IL-31 and IL-31 receptor-α (IL-31RA) transcription in leukocytes from normal and IBH horses in response to Culicoides nubeculosus. ANIMALS 19 normal and 15 IBH horses were recruited in the summer of 2019 (low-dose study) and 8 normal and 10 IBH horses in the winter of 2022 to 2023 (high-dose study). Normal horses had no history or signs of allergic skin disease, while IBH horses had a history and clinical signs compatible with IBH. Pruritus was scored using a visual analog score or a 1 to 6 grading system. PROCEDURES Whole blood leukocytes were incubated with saline (0.9% NaCl) solution or C nubeculosus (0.26 µg/mL [low dose]; 5 μg/mL [high dose]). Transcription of IL-31 and IL-31RA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS Transcription of IL-31 and IL-31RA significantly increased in leukocytes from normal and IBH horses following high-dose C nubeculosus, and no differences were found between populations. Following low-dose C nubeculosus IL-31RA, transcription was increased in both normal and IBH horses, but IL-31 transcription was reduced in normal horses. No positive correlation was found between pruritus scores and IL-31 transcription after low- or high-dose C nubeculosus stimulation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Exaggerated IL-31 transcription was not identified in IBH horses, suggesting that dysregulation in IL-31 signaling occurs downstream or in localized tissues or involves regulation by yet unidentified receptor splice variants or IL-31-induced increased sensitivity to other pruritogens. Further studies to understand IL-31 signaling in equine allergic skin disease are needed. © 2023 American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A 12-year-old Irish Sports Horse gelding was presented for investigation of a 4-month history of recurrent right sided corneal ulceration and sudden onset dysphagia and inappetence. Cranial nerve examination revealed dysfunction of the right oculomotor nerve and trigeminal nerve. Computed tomography of the skull demonstrated a mass in the region of the orbital fissure, in close association with the oculomotor and trigeminal nerves. Following the assessment, the gelding was euthanised and post-mortem examination was performed. Histopathology of the mass confirmed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma. This case report highlights the benefits of detailed clinical examination to localise a neurological lesion, and the need for histology to confirm the diagnosis. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In the past decade, there has been a considerable increase in the recognition of antimicrobial resistance in equine practice. The objective of this study was to survey the current clinical use of antimicrobials for a commonly performed surgical procedure (exploratory celiotomy) with the goal of understanding how recent literature and changes in microbial resistance patterns may have impacted antimicrobial selection practices. An electronic survey was distributed to veterinary professionals within the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) and the American College of Veterinary Surgery (ACVS). A total of 113 completed surveys were returned. Practitioners reported antimicrobials were most frequently given 30–60 min preoperatively (63.1%). Two antimicrobial classes were typically administered (95.5%), with gentamicin (98.2%) and potassium penicillin (74.3%) being the most common. Antimicrobials were typically not re-dosed intraoperatively (78.6%). Factors that affected overall treatment length postoperatively included resection (81.4%), bloodwork (75.2%), enterotomy (74.3%), fever (85.0%), incisional complications (76.1%), and thrombophlebitis (67.3%). The most common duration of antimicrobial use was 1–3 d for non-strangulating lesions (54.4% of cases) and inflammatory conditions such as enteritis or peritonitis (50.4%), and 3–5 d for strangulating lesions (63.7%). Peri-incisional and intra-abdominal antimicrobials were used by 24.8% and 11.5% of respondents, respectively. In summary, antimicrobial usage patterns were highly variable among practitioners and, at times, not concordant with current literature. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA) is a genetic disease that alters collagen biosynthesis. Affected horses exhibit fragile, hyperextensible skin, especially over the dorsal region. Although ultraviolet (UV) radiation seems to contribute to the regional distribution of lesions and worsening of clinical signs, the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of solar radiation on matrix metalloproteinase MMP1, MMP8 and MMP13 gene expression in the dorsal and ventral skin of HERDA-affected and HERDA-unaffected horses [wild-type (WT) horses]. Animals: Six HERDA-affected and six unaffected Quarter horses (WT) were paired according to age, sex and coat colour. Materials and methods: Horses were submitted to 30 day sunlight restriction, followed by 15 day sunlight exposure. Dorsal and ventral skin biopsies were obtained at six sampling times over 45 days. The expression of MMP1, MMP8 and MMP13 genes was measured by quantitative PCR. Results: Although solar radiation modulated MMP1, MMP8 and MMP13 expression, the effects were more pronounced on MMP1. Sun exposure for three days significantly upregulated MMP1 in the dorsal region when compared to the ventral skin in both unaffected and HERDA-affected horses. Conclusions and clinical relevance: This study shows that solar irradiation leads to upregulation of skin collagenase genes particularly MMP1 in the dorsal, sun-exposed skin of horses. Furthermore, this was more marked in HERDA-affected horses. The increased activity of collagenases on the disorganised collagen present in HERDA affected horses would explain why UV radiation leads to deterioration of clinical signs in affected individuals. © 2022 ESVD and ACVD.

ABSTRACT: Feral horses, also known as brumbies, are widely distributed across Australia with some populations being managed largely by human intervention. Rehoming of suitable feral horses following passive trapping has wide community acceptance as a management tool. However, there is little information about the number and relative economic value of feral horses compared with cohorts in the riding horse market. We examined 15,404 advertisements of horses for sale in 53 editions of Horse Deals, published from February 2017 to July 2022. Despite the considerable media attention and public scrutiny surrounding feral horse management, rehomed feral horses represented only a tiny fraction of the horse market in the current study. Of the 15,404 advertisements examined, only 128 (0.0083%) were for feral horses. We recorded phrases used to describe behavioural characteristics and other variables. The following variables were found to be not independent: Ridden Status, Height, Age, Sex, Colour, and Warning terms/more work. Using descriptive statistics to describe basic features of the data, the average price for feral horses ($1408) was lower than that for domestic horses ($1790) with the maximum price for a domestic horse being nearly twice the maximum for a feral horse. Univariate analysis showed feral horses were over-represented among “Unbroken” horses and underrepresented among “Ridden”, “Broodmare” and “Harness” horses compared with domestic bred horses (p < 0.001). Feral horses appeared over-represented at shorter heights, among younger age groups (3 years or younger and 3.1 to 6 years) (p < 0.001) and in the dilute colour category (p = 0.008). The multivariable mixed model on price revealed that for domestic horses, the highest estimated marginal mean price averaged across the colour categories was for ridden horses aged 6.1–10-year-old at $1657.04 (95% CI $1320.56–$2074.66). In contrast, for feral horses, the multivariable mixed model demonstrated the similar highest estimated marginal mean averaged was for green broken 3–6-year-old horses that have undergone foundation training under saddle at $2526.97 (95% CI $1505.63–$4208.27). Australian feral horses were valued differently tfromsimilar domestic horses in the recreational riding horse market and further research is warranted to determine appropriate target markets and boost the sustainability of rehoming as a feral horse management tool. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Organic waste decomposition can make up substantial amounts of municipal greenhouse emissions during decomposition. Composting has the potential to reduce these emissions as well as generate sustainable fertilizer. However, our understanding of how complex microbial communities change to drive the chemical and biological processes of composting is still limited. To investigate the microbiota associated with organic waste decomposition, initial composting feedstock (Litter), three composting windrows of 1.5 months (Young phase), 3 months (Middle phase) and 12 months (Aged phase) old, and 24-month-old mature Compost were sampled to assess physicochemical properties, plant cell wall composition and the microbial community using 16S rRNA gene amplification. A total of 2,612 Exact Sequence Variants (ESVs) included 517 annotated as putative species and 694 as genera which together captured 57.7% of the 3,133,873 sequences, with the most abundant species being Thermobifida fusca, Thermomonospora chromogena and Thermobifida bifida. Compost properties changed rapidly over time alongside the diversity of the compost community, which increased as composting progressed, and multivariate analysis indicated significant variation in community composition between each time-point. The abundance of bacteria in the feedstock is strongly correlated with the presence of organic matter and the abundance of plant cell wall components. Temperature and pH are the most strongly correlated parameters with bacterial abundance in the thermophilic and cooling phases/mature compost respectively. Differential abundance analysis revealed 810 ESVs annotated as species significantly varied in relative abundance between Litter and Young phase, 653 between the Young and Middle phases, 1182 between Middle and Aged phases and 663 between Aged phase and mature Compost. These changes indicated that structural carbohydrates and lignin degrading species were abundant at the beginning of the thermophilic phase, especially members of the Firmicute and Actinobacteria phyla. A high diversity of species capable of putative ammonification and denitrification were consistently found throughout the composting phases, whereas a limited number of nitrifying bacteria were identified and were significantly enriched within the later mesophilic composting phases. High microbial community resolution also revealed unexpected species which could be beneficial for agricultural soils enriched with mature compost or for the deployment of environmental and plant biotechnologies. Understanding the dynamics of these microbial communities could lead to improved waste management strategies and the development of input-specific composting protocols to optimize carbon and nitrogen transformation and promote a diverse and functional microflora in mature compost. © 2023 PeerJ Inc..

ABSTRACT: Background: Clodronate is a potent antiresorptive agent labelled for use in horses over 4 years of age, for the treatment of navicular syndrome. Concerns regarding the extra-label use of clodronate in equine athletes, such as racehorses, have been raised as inhibition of osteoclast activity by clodronate has been postulated to interfere with normal bone healing, which is imperative to the repair of microfractures. The paucity of data describing the long-term pharmacokinetics of clodronate and effects on biomarkers of bone resorption necessitates further study. Objectives: (1) To determine clodronate concentrations in blood and urine over a 6-month period in horses undergoing treadmill exercise and (2) to assess the effects of clodronate on protein biomarkers of bone remodelling in this same group of horses. Study design: Randomised controlled experimental study. Methods: Seven exercised Thoroughbred horses received a single im administration of 1.8 mg/kg clodronate and four horses received an equivalent volume of saline. Blood and urine samples were collected prior to, during and for 182 days post drug administration for drug concentration determination using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and determination of protein biomarker (CTX-1 and TRAcP5B) concentrations. Results: Clodronate was detectable in blood for 14–175 days and for up to 175 days in urine. For some horses, concentrations were nondetectable at one time point but detectable at a subsequent time point. The terminal serum half-life ranged from 1.80 to 283.9 days. CTX-1 concentrations were significantly higher, relative to baseline, in both treated and control groups while concentrations of TRAcP5B were significantly lower in the treated group. Main limitations: Relatively small number of horses studied. Conclusions: Based on assessment of protein biomarkers, clodronate appears to influence osteoclasts at label doses. Furthermore, results of this study support racing regulations that preclude horses administered bisphosphonates for medical reasons, from racing for a prolonged period of time. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Among the recognized neurologic diseases in horses, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) has been reported around the world and still presents challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Horses can present with clinical neurologic signs consistent with EPM while testing negative for the two main causative agents, Sarcocystis neurona or Neospora hughesi, and may still be clinically responsive to anti-parasitic drug therapy. This context led to our hypothesis that another protozoal parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, which is known to cause toxoplasmosis in other mammalian species, is a potential pathogen to cause neurologic disease in horses. To evaluate this hypothesis, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from 210 horses presenting with clinical signs compatible with EPM, and the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used to detect antibody titers for T. gondii, S. neurona, and N. hughesi. Additionally, the serum to CSF titer ratio was calculated for T. gondii, S. neurona, and N. hughesi infections, suggesting intrathecally-derived antibodies for each of the three agents if the serum:CSF ratio was ≤ 64. There were 133 (63.3%) horses positive for serum T. gondii antibodies using a cutoff titer of 160, and 31 (14.8%) positive for CSF T. gondii antibodies using a cutoff titer of 5. Overall, 21 (10.0%) of EPM-suspect horses had a serum:CSF ratio ≤ 64 for antibodies for T. gondii, while 43 (20.5%) and 8 (3.8%) horses had a serum to CSF ratio ≤ 64 for antibodies for S. neurona and N. hughesi, respectively. A total of 6 (2.9%) animals presented evidence of concurrent intrathecally-derived antibodies for T. gondii and at least one other apicomplexan parasite in this study. Signalment and clinical signs were not different across the groups aforementioned. These data provide evidence of intrathecal production of anti-T. gondii antibodies, indicative of T. gondii infection in the brain and/or spinal cord of horses with EPM-like disease. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Laminitis associated with equine metabolic syndrome causes significant economic losses in the equine industry. Diets high in non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) have been linked to insulin resistance and laminitis in horses. Nutrigenomic studies analyzing the interaction of diets high in NSCs and gene expression regulating endogenous microRNAs (miRNA) are rare. This study's objectives were to determine whether miRNAs from dietary corn can be detected in equine serum and muscle and its impacts on endogenous miRNA. Twelve mares were blocked by age, body condition score, and weight and assigned to a control (mixed legume grass hay diet) and a mixed legume hay diet supplemented with corn. Muscle biopsies and serum were collected on Days 0 and 28. Transcript abundances were analyzed using qRT-PCR for three plant-specific and 277 endogenous equine miRNAs. Plant miRNAs were found in serum and skeletal muscle samples with a treatment effect (p <.05) with corn-specific miRNA being higher than control in serum after feeding. Endogenous miRNAs showed 12 different (p <.05) miRNAs in equine serum after corn supplementation, six (eca-mir16, -4863p, -4865p, -126-3p, -296, and -192) previously linked to obesity or metabolic disease. The results of our study indicate that dietary plant miRNAs can appear in circulation and tissues and may regulate endogenous genes. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This clinical case report details the use of a radio-guided parathyroidectomy technique using a hand-held gamma detector and technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy for detection and removal of a functional parathyroid adenoma in a horse. An 18-year-old Arabian gelding was diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism based on persistent hypercalcaemia and increased parathyroid hormone concentration. Single gland disease was suspected after technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy showed focal increased radiopharmaceutical uptake (IRU) at the thoracic inlet. Ultrasonography failed to identify a discrete mass in the region of IRU. Surgical excision was recommended; however, due to unreliable preoperative localisation, a radio-guided parathyroidectomy technique was elected. A radio-guided parathyroidectomy technique was performed under general anaesthesia using a hand-held gamma detector and technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy to identify the parathyroid adenoma, which was subsequently excised. The horse recovered from the procedure without complication. Successful removal of the parathyroid adenoma was confirmed based on histopathological and serum bioch findings. Following the procedure, the horse showed no evidence of hyperparathyroidism and returned to light pleasure riding. Three years postoperatively, the gelding died of unrelated natural causes; a post-mortem examination was not performed. This radio-guided parathyroidectomy technique was effective in facilitating the removal of a parathyroid adenoma in this gelding and might be useful in other equids that have primary hyperparathyroidism IRU on technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy, particularly if a discrete mass cannot be identified ultrasonographically. © 2022 EVJ Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how populations adapt to their environment is increasingly important to prevent biodiversity loss due to overexploitation and climate change. Here we studied the population structure and genetic basis of local adaptation of Atlantic horse mackerel, a commercially and ecologically important marine fish that has one of the widest distributions in the eastern Atlantic. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing and environmental data of samples collected from the North Sea to North Africa and the western Mediterranean Sea. Our genomic approach indicated low population structure with a major split between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and between locations north and south of mid-Portugal. Populations from the North Sea are the most genetically distinct in the Atlantic. We discovered that most population structure patterns are driven by a few highly differentiated putatively adaptive loci. Seven loci discriminate the North Sea, two the Mediterranean Sea, and a large putative inversion (9.9 Mb) on chromosome 21 underlines the north–south divide and distinguishes North Africa. A genome–environment association analysis indicates that mean seawater temperature and temperature range, or factors correlated to them, are likely the main environmental drivers of local adaptation. Our genomic data broadly support the current stock divisions, but highlight areas of potential mixing, which require further investigation. Moreover, we demonstrate that as few as 17 highly informative SNPs can genetically discriminate the North Sea and North African samples from neighboring populations. Our study highlights the importance of both, life history and climate-related selective pressures in shaping population structure patterns in marine fish. It also supports that chromosomal rearrangements play a key role in local adaptation with gene flow. This study provides the basis for more accurate delineation of the horse mackerel stocks and paves the way for improving stock assessments. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A descriptive case report of the management of a miniature pony presenting to a UK equine veterinary hospital with marked trismus and increased masseter muscle size. Diagnosis of masseter myodegeneration (MM) was aided by the use of computed tomography and excisional biopsy. Hyperlipaemia was diagnosed as a sequelae of MM. Treatment included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, parenteral nutrition and fluid therapy in addition to supportive care. The gelding was discharged from the hospital 30 days after admission, having made a full recovery. MM in the horse is a rare condition that appears to be physiologically distinct from canine masticatory muscle myositis which is primarily immune mediated. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Alveolar echinococcosis in slaughtered horses remains a public health issue. This study aimed to develop a Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay targeting the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (Nad5) gene of Echinococcus multilocularis for the rapid detection of equine alveolar echinococcosis. Thirty-six hepatic solid nodules obtained from each horse (n = 36) were evaluated based on histopathological examination and Nad5-targeted PCR and then submitted to the RPA assay. The results of the developed RPA assay were 94.4% consistent with those of Nad5 PCR and Cohen's kappa coefficient value was 0.89 statistically, indicating high agreement. In addition, the RPA assay using the plasmid samples was one hundredfold more sensitive than PCR testing. Consequently, these results suggest that the performance of the RPA assay developed in this study is equal to that of conventional PCR testing. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Chronic progressive lymphedema (CPL) in draft horses is characterized by increased dermal thickness and fibrosis, with the development of skinfolds and nodules, hyperkeratosis, and ulcerations on the distal limbs of affected horses. Secondary bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections frequently complicate and aggravate the lesions, as well as the progression of this disease. CPL has a particularly high prevalence of up to 85.86% in the Belgian draft horse breed. Due to the disease’s progressive and incurable nature, affected horses are often euthanized prematurely. The treatment options are solely symptomatic, aimed at improving the horse’s quality of life. Despite the severity of this condition, many uncertainties about its etiology and pathogenesis still remain to date. The established scientific research on CPL is rather limited, although there is an urgent need for strategies to tackle this disease. This review summarizes the available knowledge, serving as a guideline for practitioners, and provides perspectives for future research programs. © 2023 by the authors.
