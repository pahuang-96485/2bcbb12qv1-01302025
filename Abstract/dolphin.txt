ABSTRACT: Understanding population demography of threatened species and how they vary in relation to natural and anthropogenic stressors is essential for effective conservation. We used a long-term photographic capture-recapture dataset (1993–2020) of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the highly urbanised Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary (ADS), South Australia, to estimate key demographic parameters and their variability over time. These parameters were analysed in relation to environmental variables used as indicators of local and large-scale climatic events. Our findings indicate that apparent survival was high (0.98–0.99) and did not vary seasonally. Estimates of abundance were not directly related to environmental variables but were linked to seasonal temporary emigration. Abundance peaked in summer with an average of 85.37 dolphins (SD = 30.23) and was lowest in winter, with 68.57 (SD = 24.70) individuals. Site fidelity at the population level was low, but lagged identification rates revealed a population of approximately 28 individuals at any one time. Trend analysis suggests an increase in dolphin abundance from 1993 and persistence of the population over decades despite significant urbanisation, although numbers have declined in more recent years. Further research is needed to understand the cumulative impacts leading to this population decline and to assess its future viability under different management scenarios. Conservation strategies aimed at increasing reproductive rates and promoting connectivity to adjacent waters are likely to be more effective in reversing population declines. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is a widely distributed species exhibiting extensive morphological diversity, with previous taxonomies recognizing multiple Delphinus species primarily based on relative beak length. We sequenced mitochondrial genomes of D. delphis morphotypes from multiple regions, calculated mitogenome nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00504), dated Delphinus mitogenome diversification to 1.27 mya, and conducted phylogenetic and population-level analyses focusing on morphotype and geographic origin. We present the first Delphinus sequencing data from Senegal, at the edge of where long- and short-beaked dolphins co-occur in the Atlantic, but only recovering stranded dolphins with long or indeterminate beak lengths. While we detected little genetic structure across most of the North Atlantic, fixation indices demonstrate that Senegalese dolphins are distinct. Geography did not reliably predict phylogeny, with few monophyletic localities, but we do infer a monophyletic group of long-beaked dolphins from California, Peru, and possibly China. However, neither Senegalese long-beaked dolphins nor long-beaked D. d. tropicalis are closely related to Pacific long-beaked dolphins, providing no support for a worldwide long-beaked clade (formerly D. capensis). Our findings reveal a distinctive Senegal Delphinus population and provide a foundation for global genomic analyses to further investigate the evolution of Delphinus morphotypes. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study assessed the exposure of free-ranging Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) to phthalate esters (PAE) in a remote area of the Brazilian Amazon. Blubber samples were analyzed for four PAEs - dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate - and cholesterol contents to evaluate potential metabolic disturbances. All dolphins were contaminated with at least two PAEs, with DEHP (242.16 ng/μL) and DBP (191.62 ng/μL) being the most frequent, detected in 93 % and 79 % of the sample, respectively. Significant positive correlations were found between DBP and DEP (r = 0.857), DEHP and DEP (r = 0.794), and DBP and body length (r = 0.642), suggesting bioaccumulation. Despite the cholesterol data not showing a correlation with the other findings, these results highlight PAE pollution in a supposedly pristine environment and their potential impact on the health and conservation of Amazon River dolphins' health and Amazonian ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) exhibits significant intraspecific diversity globally, with distinct ecotypes identified in various regions. In the Guadeloupe archipelago, the citizen science NGO OMMAG has been monitoring these dolphins for over a decade, documenting two distinct morphotypes. This study investigates whether these morphotypes represent coastal and oceanic ecotypes, which have not been previously identified in the region. We characterized morphological differences between the two morphotypes, analyzed genetic variation in individuals stranded around Guadeloupe over the past ten years, and modeled their habitats. Results revealed that these morphotypes align with the ecotypes described in the Atlantic Ocean, forming two distinct genetic groups corresponding to Caribbean ecotypes. Habitat modeling showed differences in habitat preferences between the morphotypes. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of two distinct ecotypes of T. truncatus in Guadeloupe. Considering the varied risks of exposure to maritime traffic, our study suggests that these ecotypes should be managed as separate units within the species to better inform conservation strategies in the region. © 2025 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Since late 2021, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) lineage have caused widespread mortality in wild birds and poultry in the United States. Concomitant with the spread of HPAI viruses in birds are increasing numbers of mammalian infections, including wild and captive mesocarnivores and carnivores with central nervous system involvement. Here we report HPAI, A(H5N1) of clade 2.3.4.4b, in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) from Florida, United States. Pathological findings include neuronal necrosis and inflammation of the brain and meninges, and quantitative real time RT-PCR reveal the brain carried the highest viral load. Virus isolated from the brain contains a S246N neuraminidase substitution which leads to reduced inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. The increased prevalence of A(H5N1) viruses in atypical avian hosts and its cross-species transmission into mammalian species highlights the public health importance of continued disease surveillance and biosecurity protocols. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The present study, covering 2018–2022, evaluated the cetacean interactions with a bottom-set net fishery along the mainland Portuguese Southern coast (Algarve), estimating bycatch, depredation, gear damage and net length influence on Landing per Unit Effort (LPUE). The fishery employed various métiers (gillnets - mesh sizes: < 60, 60–75, 80 and 220 mm; trammel nets - 120 inner and 640 mm outer panels). Observations from 655 hauls revealed depredation by bottlenose dolphins in 17.7 % of hauls, while bycatch (isolated events of 4 bottlenose dolphins and one common dolphin) occurred in < 1 %. Depredation typically results in heavy damage to the net and occurs throughout the year, with elevated rates observed during the spring and winter months. Depredation rates varied among métiers, being higher in gears targeting red mullet and hake. The impact of depredation on LPUE varied based on net length and the targeted fish species. However, when comparing LPUE in hauls without depredation, there was no significant influence on the total and hake LPUE for nets shorter or longer than 6 km (p > 0.05). Interestingly, in hauls targeting red mullets without depredation, nets shorter than 6 km had a significantly higher LPUE (p < 0.01) compared to nets 6 km or longer, suggesting that longer nets increase fishing effort due to prolonged soaking times and a higher likelihood of depredation. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Marine litter is known to be a major stressor in coastal marine habitats. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the areas where species could be most threatened by floating marine macro-litter (FML) The composition and density distribution of FML along the waters of the Agrigento province was monitored from 2019 to 2021, together with the density distribution for the protected species Tursiops truncatus, Hydrobates pelagicus melitensis, Calonectris diomedea, and Puffinus yelkouan. The areas where marine litter poses the biggest threat to these species were identified by overlapping the core areas of their distribution with that of FML. The results showed that FML's was mainly composed of plastics (90 %). There was a high degree of overlap between FML's core area and focal species: 65 % for bottlenose dolphins, 76,3 % for the European storm-petrel, and 85,1 % for the shearwaters. Our findings highlight a key area of about 54 km2, within the 25–70 m depth, where the highest presence of protected species and FML was observed. The high degree of overlap of the species and FML core-areas underlines the need to enact specific management measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Tin Can Bay, Queensland, is one of four free-ranging dolphin feed provisioning sites in Australia and the only one featuring Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis). The site attracts the same 5–10 dolphins a year, most of which return regularly, and some which have been in attendance since the 1990s. Historical records were obtained for the period March 2010 to March 2021 covering dolphin attendance to the provisioning station including dolphin name, arrival time, and departure time. Tourist numbers were also obtained which included the total number and how many of that total directly took part in provisioning. Attendance of dolphins to the provisioning site has increased over the years both in frequency and total numbers. There was evidence of group cohesion between four particular dolphins (one mother-offspring pair and one male pair). The strongest pairing was seen between two males, indicating bond formation in adult male humpback dolphins, which may be indicative of an alliance. Specific events were also looked at in detail including cyclones, flooding COVID-19 restrictions, which reduced dolphin and/or human attendance. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The southern right whale dolphin, Lissodelphis peronii (Lacépède, 1804), is a species of cetacean that is distributed in cold and deep waters throughout the Southern Hemisphere, with records in coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean being extremely rare. On January 7, 2019, a specimen still alive, was recorded entangled in a fishing gillnet on the beach at Cardoso Beach (28°44′S, 48°58′W), in the state of Santa Catarina, on the southern coast of Brazil. The recording was made by a lifeguard using a GoPro camera and was made available through citizen science. The animal was untangled and released while still alive and was not found stranded again after the date of the event. Based on existing literature, this is the second record of the species in Brazilian waters. Analyzing meteorological and oceanographic features from the days preceding the record, it was not possible to make any association between the entanglement and the variables analyzed, and no explanatory driver could therefore be established for this unusual event. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: To tag large marine vertebrates, without the need to catch them, avoiding using barbs for tag retention, and precisely controlling tag location, the remote Tag Attachment Device on a pole (TADpole) was developed. This allows single-pin tags (Finmount, Wildlife Computers) to be attached to the dorsal fins of free-swimming large marine vertebrates. Results: TADpole comprises a pole-mounted holster that carries a tag. It uses compressed air, and a micro-controller, to rapidly insert a stainless-steel pin through a corrodible metal retaining ring in the first tag attachment wing, the animal’s dorsal fin, and then a press fit Delrin retaining ring in the tag wing on the other side of the fin. Tagging only occurs when the trailing edge of the dorsal fin touches a trigger bar in the holster, ensuring optimal pin placement. It was developed using fins from cadavers, then trialed on briefly restrained coastal dolphins that could be followed in successive days and weeks, and then on free-swimming animals in the field. The latter showed very short touch/response intervals and highlighted the need for several iterative revisions of the pneumatic system. This resulted in reducing the total time from triggering to tag application to ~ 20 ms. Subsequent efforts expanded the TADpole’s applicability to sharks. One free-swimming Atlantic spotted dolphin, two white sharks, and one whale shark were then tagged using the TADpole. Conclusions: Being able to tag free-swimming dolphins and sharks remotely and precisely with satellite-linked telemetry devices may contribute to solving conservation challenges. Sharks were easier to tag than dolphins. Dolphin touch-to-response times were 28 ms or less. Delphinid skin has unique polymodal axon bundles that project into the epidermis, perhaps a factor in their uniquely fast response, which is 10 × faster than humans. Their primary reaction to tagging is to abduct the flippers and roll the fin out of the TADpole holster. This device has the potential to deliver high-quality tag data from large vertebrates with dorsal fins without the stress and logistics associated with catch-and-release, and without the trauma of tags that use barbs for retention. It also collects a dorsal fin biopsy core. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Despite the growing awareness on the importance of gut microbiomes, understanding marine mammal gut microbiomes remains limited due to difficulties in sampling. Spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) are widely spread oceanic cetaceans, and there is a gap in knowledge regarding their gut microbiology. In this study, we opportunistically collected samples from both wild and human-cared spotted dolphins in the southern waters of Hainan Island, China. This provided the opportunity to examine the composition and diversity of the gut microbial communities of this cetacean species. Since these dolphins inhabit a similar water environment, different food sources might be the primary factor distinguishing the gut microbiomes of wild and human-cared populations, offering valuable experimental material to investigate potential differences in gut microbial community structure among marine mammals in similar environments but with varying food sources. We found that the gastrointestinal microbial community structure of wild and human-cared dolphins demonstrated significant differences, both overall and at specific locations. However, no significant difference was observed in the microbial diversity of their gastrointestinal tracts, indicating that the disparities primarily lie in microbiota composition. Additionally, we detected numerous potentially pathogenic bacteria, suggesting a comprehensive future study of marine mammal gut microbiology. Such a study might involve determining health indicator factors associated with these microbiomes. Our study not only supplements information on the gut microbiology of spotted dolphins but also delves into the similarities and differences in gastrointestinal microbial communities within the same marine mammal species when food source variations play a significant role in their lives. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a small-toothed whale species that inhabits estuaries and shallow coastal waters from the eastern Indian Ocean to the western Pacific, and faces significant negative impacts from anthropogenic activities. The noninvasive Photo-identification method enables individual identification and abundance estimation based on natural markings of cetaceans without disrupting their natural behaviors. Currently, the identification of S. chinensis using photographs relies primarily on time-intensive visual recognition by experienced researchers. Through field surveys conducted in the west Huangmao Sea area from 2012 to 2021, we compiled the Zhu-Ming data set focusing on S. chinensis (ZMSC), consisting of 479 individuals and 5,196 photos. Utilizing the ZMSC, we proposed a Few-Shot Identification method for S. chinensis (FISC), which achieved 85.93% identification Top-1 accuracy. The implementation of proper preprocessing steps and data augmentation techniques has significantly enhanced the performance of FISC, while visualizing network weights has improved its interpretability. Despite the remaining challenges of data imbalance and the inability to automatically allocate new labels, ZMFISC alleviates the challenge of the current heavy reliance on time-intensive visual recognition methods by researchers for individual identification of S. chinensis and provide a valuable tool to enhance future conservation efforts for S. chinensis. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: It has been demonstrated that the flexibility of the structure can enhance the kinematic performance of the underwater bionic robotic fish. Furthermore, the thrust of the underwater robotic fish can be further enhanced by changing the stiffness of the tail when the motion frequency of the propulsion system increases. This paper proposes a novel actuator, the pneumatic variable stiffness imitation dolphin tail actuator (PVSA), which combines soft robotics with the structural characteristics and movement mode of a biological dolphin. The PVSA comprises a pneumatic bi-directional bending soft actuator and a pull-wire-driven variable stiffness mechanism. The soft actuator is capable of mimicking the dorsoventral movement of dolphins by changing the pressure difference between the cavities, thereby achieving bending deformation. The variable stiffness mechanism is based on the stiffness mechanism of particle interference and the structural characteristics of vertebrate endoskeleton, with the objective of achieving variable stiffness. The parameters of the PVSA are optimised using numerical simulations and experimental studies, and then designed underwater experiments are conducted to investigate the effects of amplitude, stiffness and frequency on the propulsive performance of the PVSA. The results demonstrate that the PVSA is capable of enhancing thrust by adjusting its own stiffness and movement frequency. The development of the PVSA provides a reference for the research of related underwater bionic propulsion technology. © Jilin University 2024.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic global change is occurring at alarming rates, leading to increased urgency in the ability to monitor wildlife health in real time. Monitoring sentinel marine species, such as bottlenose dolphins, is particularly important due to extensive anthropogenic modifications to their habitats. The most common non-invasive method of monitoring cetacean health is documentation of skin lesions, often associated with poor health or disease, but the current methodology is inefficient and imprecise. Recent advancements in technology, such as machine learning, can provide researchers with more efficient ecological monitoring methods to address health questions at both the population and the individual levels. Our work develops a machine learning model to classify skin lesions on the understudied Tamanend's bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops erebennus) of the Chesapeake Bay, using manual estimates of lesion presence in photographs. We assess the model's performance and find that our best model performs with a high mean average precision (65.6 %–86.8 %), and generally increased accuracy with improved photo quality. We also demonstrate the model's ability to address ecological questions across scales by generating model-based estimates of lesion prevalence and testing the effect of gregariousness on health status. At the population level, our model accurately estimates a prevalence of 72.1 % spot and 27.3 % fringe ring lesions, with a slight underprediction compared to manual estimates (82.2 % and 32.1 %). On the other hand, we find that individual-level analyses from the model predictions may be more sensitive to data quality, and thus, some individual scale questions may not be feasible to address if data quality is inconsistent. Manually, we do find that lesion presence in individuals suggests a positive relationship between lesion presence and gregariousness. This work demonstrates that object detection models on photographic data are reasonably successful, highly efficient, and provide initial estimates on the health status of understudied populations of bottlenose dolphins. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The impact of vessels on dolphin populations has been extensively studied worldwide. The common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, has been observed in the Tagus estuary for the past two centuries, and during the last several years, these sightings seem to have increased. This area has high levels of maritime traffic throughout the year, both commercial and recreational. To understand the possible effects of vessel traffic on dolphins’ behavior, land-based observations were carried out from March 2022 to March 2023. For a total of 67 events (48.9 h of dolphin sightings), differences in behavioral budgets were noted. Although “neutral reaction” was the most observed response when vessels were in the vicinity of dolphins, “negative reaction” was also common and five times more abundant than “positive reaction”. The GEE model showed statistical differences between these reaction types (positive, neutral, and negative). Markov chains’ analysis revealed distinct patterns in the behavioral transition probabilities, as dolphins were more likely to switch to a traveling state when vessels were nearby. This study is the first step towards understanding a potential impact source in the area since it is expected that tourism companies expand due to the increase in dolphin sightings in the estuary. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The assessment of wild animal welfare has recently gained interest and represents a novel, complementary approach to monitoring free-ranging populations for conservation purposes. However, few attempts have been made to develop standardized welfare assessment tools for free-ranging animals. In the present study, a preliminary scoring system for the welfare assessment of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (IPHDs) was created using the Five Domains Model. During a series of online meetings, the panel established the scoring unit, the contribution of each parameter to the four physical/functional domains, the inferred mental states and impact intensity associated with each of these parameters, and the method of aggregating parameter scores within and among domains. The resulting framework includes a total of 53 parameter scores. A total of 20 welfare-status and 33 welfare-alerting parameters were identified; these are aggregated into two overall welfare grades for enhancement (positive experiences) and compromise (negative experiences). The panel attributed confidence scores to the intensity impact reflected by each parameter and associated mental states. As expected, these scores reflect higher confidence in welfare-status than welfare-alerting parameters; welfare compromise was also attributed higher confidence than welfare enhancement and Domain 1 (Nutrition) globally received higher confidence scores than other domains. As with any expert elicitation study, subjective biases likely exist; these can be reduced through further research on the suggested parameters. The framework uses current knowledge and has been developed to enable continual improvement as further evidence becomes available on various parameters. This study represents an important step in the development of a welfare assessment tool (WAT) for IPHDs. Next steps include defining measurement methods and thresholds for scoring parameter intensities, followed by reliability testing. This WAT can then be used to systematically monitor populations of IPHDs in a way that will better inform conservation measures and ensure their effectiveness. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This paper deals with estimating the underlying parameter of a length-biased inverse Gaussian distribution, when the observations are prone to length-biased sampling. Length-biased sampling occurs when the observations of smaller lengths or dimensions are neglected from the sample. We focus on a particular type of sequential fixed-accuracy confidence interval for estimation purposes. This method proves to be both time and cost efficient as one is able to perform the estimation using an optimal number of observations according to some set criteria. We discuss the applicability of our proposed method with regards to estimating the cluster size of the "Eastern Tropical Pacific Dolphins", which are often vulnerable to length biasedness. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is an inshore species occurring in productive estuarine and coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific. Since the end of the 20th century, coastal region of China has experienced tremendous economic expansion, exposing this dolphin species to a wide range of human activities. Despite frequent voices of concern in the past three decades calling for research and conservation attention, protracted debates were not followed by constructive conservation actions due to the lack of or inconsistent use of demographic data. The current study examined 13-year sighting and photo-identification data collected for a small and little known population of humpback dolphins off the coast of Shantou (ST) in the northern South China Sea. Compared to conspecific populations inhabiting large or medium-sized estuarine systems, the ST dolphins have much larger home range (mean = 181.3 km2, S.D. = 87.7) which, however, has been shrinking recently due to coastal reclamations and expanding aquaculture farming. Although at least two dolphin births were recorded between 2010 and 2022, there was no successful recruitment of a non-calf individual. Meanwhile, the population shrank by 29.4 %, with the most updated population size of only 12 individuals, estimated in 2022. Based on the current demographic trend, we predict that the ST humpback dolphins will be extirpated within one or two decades. Furthermore, as the dolphins are aging and becoming less reproductively viable, there is little chance to reverse the declining trend even without additional stressors. Moreover, we noticed prevailing vertebral column deformities amongst the ST dolphins, possibly a sign of inbreeding depression of a small population. The present study exemplifies a typical case of a small, isolated and locally endangered dolphin population that is approaching local extinction without efficient monitoring program and conservation action. We emphasize that without solution-based research and efficient conservation planning, other humpback dolphin populations in China might soon follow in the steps of ST humpback dolphins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The study explores the interactions between dolphins and Cypriot fisheries, emphasizing the economic impact and fisher perceptions through data collected from structured interviews with small-scale and large pelagic fishers. The research documents frequent dolphin interactions, impacting catch and gear in both fishing sectors. Reported financial losses and gear damage highlight a significant economic burden, with annual losses averaging EUR 6144 for small-scale and EUR 29,882 for large pelagic fishers. Efforts to mitigate these interactions, such as using acoustic deterrents, have shown mixed results, reflecting dolphins’ adaptability to human activity. While some fishers use deterrents, others remain hesitant due to cost and inconsistent efficacy. The study underscores the need for improved, sustainable solutions that integrate fisher input to enhance acceptance and effectiveness. Findings suggest that dolphins are increasingly relying on fishing activities as a foraging strategy, aligning with broader trends in the Mediterranean. In the context of EU Directive 2014/89/EU, the study integrates ecological considerations and socioeconomic impacts to ensure balanced marine management strategies. This work emphasizes the complexity of human–wildlife conflicts in marine environments, suggesting that further research and collaboration with fishers are essential to developing adaptive strategies that balance conservation with the economic needs of local fishing communities. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic pressures and climate change present growing challenges for cetaceans, as the combined effects of multiple stressors can jeopardize their welfare and survival. In this context, validating reliable individual welfare indicators is crucial for quantifying these impacts. This study aimed to validate a method for measuring cortisol and oxytocin from the epidermis of stranded striped dolphins (Stenella caeruleoalba) using enzyme immunoassays, while accounting for confounding factors such as epidermal layer and body location. The effects of different causes of death—’Peracute Underwater Entrapment’ and ‘Distress Associated’— along with biological factors, were examined in relation to epidermal hormone levels. Furthermore, the relationship between these hormone levels and markers suggesting an impaired welfare, was explored. Validation tests indicated that the method was effective in quantifying both epidermal cortisol and oxytocin concentrations. Specifically, epidermal cortisol levels showed strong correlations with both serum and blubber levels and were 6 times higher in emaciated individuals and 14 times higher in those with distress-associated deaths, supporting its use in assessing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity. Interestingly, results supported the validity of epidermal cortisol levels as markers of impaired welfare in dolphins, as they consistently increased across conditions assumed to negatively affect welfare but varying in terms of severity and duration. In contrast, epidermal oxytocin levels could not be validated as an indicator of the general oxytocin system nor as an indicator of welfare in this species. In conclusion, this study successfully validated epidermal cortisol as a reliable physiological indicator of welfare in striped dolphins, providing a promising tool for assessing individual and population-level welfare impacts. However, further research is needed to fully explore the potential role of oxytocin as a welfare biomarker in cetaceans. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is facing significant threats in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, largely due to entanglement in artisanal fishing nets, which makes it the most threatened dolphin species in the region Its conservation calls for a standardised methodology that enables the detection and monitoring of dolphin populations on a longer temporal scale. This study represents the first acoustic monitoring of wild Franciscana dolphins in Argentina, focusing on understanding their diel patterns of activity and their relationship with environmental variables. Our findings show that Franciscana dolphin acoustic presence in summer in Chapadmalal (Argentina) is more frequent in January than in February and March and is influenced by the interaction between tide and wind direction. Specifically, at higher tide levels, wind direction has a reduced impact on dolphin detections. This interaction varies seasonally, with shifts observed in February and March. This research advances standardised methodologies for detecting and monitoring Franciscana dolphin populations, supporting efforts to improve their conservation. © 2025 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is an endangered cetacean that ranges throughout much of Southeast Asia and lives in coastal, estuarine, and riverine habitats including three river systems: Ayeyarwady, Mekong, and Mahakam. Many populations face risks from human interference, but overall rangewide diversity and connectivity is not well-understood. Here we sequenced 77 complete mitogenomes from across the range of the Irrawaddy dolphin including all obligate riverine populations; eighteen of these were sequenced from historical museum specimens. Phylogenetic analysis showed haplotypes from each riverine population formed separate clades nested within the wider species implying each river system was separately invaded only once. All Irrawaddy dolphin mitogenomes were dated to a last common ancestor ~764 kya. Most lineages appeared after inundation cycles of the Sunda Shelf were initiated ~400 kya. Despite the lack of monophyly among many haplotypes from the same population, no population shared any haplotypes. Rangewide nucleotide diversity was average compared to other odontocetes, but riverine populations were especially low. Differentiation was significant among all populations analyzed with the most divergence occurring between isolated riverine populations. These analyses add more evidence for the necessity of conservation efforts directed towards riverine and other isolated populations of the Irrawaddy dolphin. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Neritic, long-beaked common dolphins have been described as species distinct from the more oceanic and globally distributed short-beaked species, Delphinus delphis, although recent molecular studies have challenged this view. In the eastern North Pacific (ENP), the taxonomic status of the long-beaked (bairdii) form has been controversial since its original description in 1873, and has vacillated between species, subspecies, and geographic forms several times. It is currently provisionally viewed as a subspecies of Delphinus delphis, D. d. bairdii. To clarify this situation, we reviewed the literature and conducted additional analyses using both newly obtained genetic and cranial morphometric data sets. The results indicate that there are diagnostic differences in skull morphology and coloration between the eastern Pacific long-and short-beaked forms, and near-perfect diagnosability in mitochondrial DNA. These differences, along with indications of ecological distinctions, including important differences in life history parameters and reproductive timing, indicate that these forms are well on their way down separate evolutionary pathways. As such, we consider them to be distinct species in the eastern Pacific. The long-beaked species is referable to Delphinus bairdii Dall, 1873, and is redescribed as such herein. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin swimming has been a captivating subject, yet the dorsal fin’s hydrodynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we conducted three-dimensional simulations of flow around a wall-mounted dolphin dorsal fin derived from a real dolphin scan. The NEK5000 (spectral element method) was employed with a second-order hex20 mesh to ensure high simulation accuracy and efficiency. A total of 13 cases were simulated, covering angles of attack (AoAs) ranging from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) and Reynolds numbers (Re) between 691 and 2000. Our results show that both drag and lift increase significantly with the AoA. Almost no vortex was observed at (Formula presented.), whereas complex vortex structures emerged for (Formula presented.), including half-horseshoe, hairpin, arch, and wake vortices. This study offers insights that can inform the design of next-generation underwater robots, heat exchangers, and submarine sails. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (IPBD) (Tursiops aduncus) is a key species in marine ecosystems. Photo-identification (photo-ID) is a fundamental method for studying dolphin populations by identifying individuals based on the unique features of their dorsal fins. Despite recent developments in learning-based photo-ID algorithms, the lack of training data for these models has become a bottleneck for improving the accuracy of these algorithms. In this study, we used synthetic image generation and deep learning to improve photography-based IPBD identification. We generated 7500 synthetic dorsal fin images of 30 dolphins and trained a custom triplet neural network using ResNet50 to distinguish individuals. The model achieved 84.8 % accuracy within the top 10-ranked positions and 72.2 % accuracy in the top 5-ranked positions, demonstrating the potential of these technologies to enhance IPBD monitoring and conservation efforts. © 2024

ABSTRACT: In this study, we investigated for the first time anthropogenic microparticles in the franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei, the most endangered cetacean of the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. The intestinal content of the proximal and distal sections, and wall tissues of the proximal section of ten female dolphins collected during 2013–2023 were analyzed. All samples contained anthropogenic particles (%FO = 100). Fibers were the most abundant shape (99 %). Micro-Raman and micro-FTIR spectroscopies revealed the presence of polyester, polypropylene, acrylic, polyethylene, and semi-synthetic cotton polymers. Manufactured pigments such as reactive blue 238, Indigo 3600, and diarylide azo pigment (yellow 152) were also detected. We observed variations in the color and types of polymers present in the different sections of the intestine and within the wall tissue, suggesting a differential microplastic absorption. These findings confirm both the presence and absorption of microplastics in the intestines from franciscana dolphins. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans of the family Delphinidae are widely distributed throughout the global ocean, and it has been suggested that females exhibit philopatry. However, the duration of time that a maternal group of these highly mobile creatures spends inhabiting a particular region remains unknown. The objective of this study is to examine the genetic diversity of delphinids in the past and to shed light on the above question. In this study, we amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region from the skeletal remains of delphinids that were excavated from the Shomyoji Midden, a site situated on the western coast of Tokyo Bay and dating to 5000-3000 years before the present. We acquired prehistoric D-loop sequences of seven bottlenose dolphins, six Pacific white-sided dolphins, and a false killer whale. Notably, one or more haplotypes from the prehistoric individuals were detected in the geographically proximate modern conspecific populations across all three species. Whilst the genetic diversity of prehistoric and modern Pacific white-sided dolphin populations appears to be comparable, the modern bottlenose dolphin population demonstrates significantly lower genetic diversity when compared to its prehistoric counterpart in the vicinity of Tokyo Bay. The maternal groups of these species are speculated to have persisted in the same habitat for at least 4000 years.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins form a resident population off the east coast of Leizhou Peninsula (LZP) in South China. The most recent study suggested ~1,500 individuals in this area, making this population one of only two populations of this species exceeding 1,000 individuals. However, demographic information regarding this population has been lacking since 2012. Using a 5-year (2019–2023) photo-identification data set, we examined two key demographic parameters of the LZP population, namely the apparent survival and population size, using multistate capture-recapture analyses. Annual survival probabilities (φ) changed over time, fluctuating between 0.942 and 0.961 for adults, and between 0.787 and 0.837 for juveniles. Jolly-Seber multistate model analyses resulted in highly comparable noncalf population size estimates from 2020 to 2023 ((Formula presented.) 2020 = 479, SE = 28; (Formula presented.) 2021 = 458, SE = 29; (Formula presented.) 2022 = 481, SE = 27; (Formula presented.) 2023 = 446, SE = 31). By reviewing the available demographic information, we conclude that the population size of LZP humpback dolphins has been previously overestimated. The time-dependent survivals seemingly reflect a dynamic development of anthropogenic disturbance during the pandemic period. We propose that the population status should be re-evaluated, especially in the postpandemic era when the human activities came back to “normal” levels. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Environmental concerns about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are considerably increasing due to their extensive use in commercial and consumer products. PFAS bioaccumulate and biomagnify throughout the food chain, and their toxicity and potential adverse health effects can potentially represent a threat to living organisms. In this study, we described PFAS profiles in the serum of two species of zoo-based bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, n = 14 individuals) and killer whales (Orcinus orca, n = 14 individuals) from three locations (California, Florida, and Texas, USA), from 1994 to 2020. Potential physiological effects of PFAS were also explored by measuring different biomarkers (cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, TBARS, and hydrogen peroxide) while accounting for individual age, sex, and reproductive stage. All PFAS were detected in at least one of the individuals, considering both species. ΣPFAS reached 496 ng mL−1 in bottlenose dolphins and 230 ng mL−1 in killer whales. In both species, the PFAS with higher mean concentrations were PFOS (108.0–183.0 ng ml−1) and PFNA (14.40–85.50 ng ml−1), which are long-chain compounds. Newborn individuals of both species were also exposed to PFAS, indicating transference via placenta and lactation. Linear mixed model analyses indicated significant correlations between aldosterone, month, year, location, and status; and between hydrogen peroxide, month, year, age, status, ΣPFAS, and Σ short-chain PFAS in killer whales suggesting seasonal variations related to the animal's physiological state (e.g., reproductive cycles, stress responses, weaning events) and increased reactive oxygen species formation due to PFAS exposure. Given our results, other contaminant classes should be investigated in cetaceans as they might have additive and synergistic detrimental effects on these individuals. This study lays the foundation to guide future researchers and highlights the importance of such assessments for animal welfare, and species conservation. Our results may inform management decisions regarding regulations of contaminant thresholds in delphinids. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Microplastic (MP) pollution is widespread in aquatic environments, accumulating in organisms and transferring through the food web. This study investigated MP abundance, composition, and distribution in 15 fish species from eastern Guangdong, 11 of which are prey for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis). Results indicated the highest MP abundance in fish gastrointestinal tracts, with pelagic species being the most affected. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyethylene (PE), linked to local industrial activities, were the most prevalent polymers. Risk quotients (RQ) at 95th percentile for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins exceeded one, suggesting significant MP exposure risk via prey ingestion. In contrast, the MPs risk for humans through fish consumption was minimal. These findings underscore the urgent need for improved plastic waste management to protect marine apex predators. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Fishing exclusion zones aim to reduce cetacean bycatch, but often neglect social and ecological side effects, exacerbating social injustices and reshaping fishing practices. We present a case study of an endangered population of Lahille's bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) in a Brazilian coastal lagoon, known for its unique cooperation with net-casting fishers. However, the local small-scale fisheries (SSF) also employ other fishing gears that contribute to dolphin bycatch, prompting the enforcement of a fishing ban in the area. We investigated fishers' socioeconomic conditions, evidence of social disparities, perceptions on dolphin bycatch, and projected changes on fisheries activities to understand the repercussions of the ban. We categorized 128 surveyed fishers into five groups based on socioeconomic factors and their reliance on dolphin-cooperative and gillnet fisheries. Our findings revealed significant disparities in social capital among fishers and their different attitudes towards dolphin bycatch, highlighting unforeseen consequences. To investigate how fishers would likely shift fishing practices, we considered two management scenarios: 1) should dolphin-fishing cease due to unsuccessful bycatch mitigation, fishing efforts would shift towards shrimp trawling, seine nets, and gillnet effort; 2) if gillnet-fishing is successfully banned as a bycatch mitigation measure, a shift to shrimp trawling and cast net effort. Both scenarios would intensify pressure on shrimp stocks, which are already heavily exploited in this socioecological system. Our research underscores the importance of contemplating alternatives to achieve sustainable outcomes when designing bycatch mitigation measure. Furthermore, our results point to the importance of a participatory governance approach, grounded in the socioeconomic context, to safeguard the livelihoods of small-scale fishers and foster broader conservation efforts beyond species-specific concerns. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Canary Islands are considered a hot spot for marine species biodiversity. Each stranded cetacean has provided important scientific, biological and pathological information. The morphological identification of parasites in these stranded cetaceans is the main aim of the present article. An investigation to identify parasites was carried out in 233 stranded animals (2018–2022), which were submitted for necropsy. Adult and sub-adult/juvenile animals were the most parasitized age categories, and eighteen parasite species were morphologically identified, including nematodes (Crassicauda grampicola, Crassicauda anthonyi, Halocercus delphini, Anisakis simplex, Stenurus globicephalae, Stenurus ovatus), trematodes (Nasitrema delphini, Oschmarinella rochebruni, Brachycladium atlanticum, Pholeter gastrophilus), cestodes (Clistobothrium delphini, Clistobothrium grimaldii), acanthocephalans (Bolbosoma vasculosum, Bolbosoma capitatum), protists (Toxoplasma gondii) and crustaceans (Conchoderma auritum, Xenobalanus globicipitis, Pennella balaenoptera), as well as nine genera: Crassicauda sp., Halocercus sp., Anisakis sp., Stenurus sp., Nasitrema sp., Oschmarinella sp., Dyphyllobothrium sp., Cyamus sp., Conchoderma sp., and Sarcocystis sp. These could not be identified at the species level. Differences in the host specificity of some parasites were observed, varying in prevalence. The accurate morphological identification of the parasites affecting these marine mammals is essential to understanding disease epidemiology, assessing cetacean populations’ health status, and developing effective conservation and management strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Offshore floating platforms are increasingly being examined for their possibilities of harvesting wave and wind energy in addition to oil and gas exploration functions. The current experimental studies are focused on the design and development of the TSUSUCA DOLPHIN. TSUSUCA is a coined word that is abbreviated as Tsunami Protection Solar Power Utilization and coastal applications. This new multi-purpose floating device can be a wave energy convertor and a tsunami barrier. A bio-inspired dolphin-shaped body is combined with a linear motion electricity generator (LMEG) that is hinged at the top of the base block. The proposed design distinguishes it from the other wave energy converters that operate in normal sea states. TSUSUCA DOLPHIN, designed for the near-shore conditions, is experimentally investigated under regular waves to compare its performance under different inputs. In a few cases considered in the study, hydropower obtained from the device recorded an efficiency of about 32% and the electrical power efficiency of LMEG is about 30.07%. The proof of concept is successfully demonstrated by the bio-inspired device’s performance. This research lays the groundwork for future developments in this area by facilitating the creation of further devices that target the use of wave energy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

ABSTRACT: Ocean noise generated by human activities at sea has been increasing over the decades, affecting marine ecosystems. Ship traffic flow between the Mediterranean or South Atlantic and northern Europe makes the coast of Portugal one of the most intense shipping highways on a global scale. Among the cetaceans of the coast of Portugal, the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) was selected as a target species. Based on 15 years of observations, the common dolphins' habitat suitability was estimated, together with the shipping noise maps for the year 2019, to produce seasonal risk maps for the same year. A large number of areas with a high noise risk index (≥0.85) were found in Portugal's southern and southwestern coasts, especially during the summer and fall seasons. Comparably, the 0.50 risk index exceeds 7 % and 3.5 % of the total area in summer and fall, respectively. These percentages decrease to 1 % in spring and winter. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This study delves into the eco-dynamics of three dolphin species in the ultra-oligotrophic waters off the southern Israeli Mediterranean coast - two neritic: the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and one pelagic: the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). It utilizes compound-specific stable isotope analysis of individual amino acids to investigate carbon and nitrogen source variability and trophic positioning among the three species. Muscle samples from stranded individuals were analyzed for carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopic ratios of amino acids, with Δδ15N (Glutamate-Phenylalanine) acting as an indicator of relative trophic position. The findings reveal minor differences in carbon source signatures and trophic position among species, but distinct nitrogen source signatures. The latter indicate discrete foraging habitats for bottlenose and striped dolphins and suggest that common dolphins transition between shallow benthic and deep pelagic feeding areas during the day and night, respectively, as part of their survival strategy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Concentrations of nine trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Se, Zn) in hepatic, renal and epidermal tissues were investigated in three dolphin species (Burrunan dolphin, Tursiops australis; common bottlenose dolphin, T. truncatus; short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis) within southeast Australia. Elevated hepatic Hg was found in critically endangered Burrunan dolphins (62.5–4990 mg/kg dw) and common bottlenose dolphins (102–1770 mg/kg dw), amongst the highest for the taxa globally, exceeding the short-beaked common dolphins (3.24–370 mg/kg dw), likely due to dietary differences. Hepatic Hg:Se molar ratios exceeded 1 in 60 % of dolphins, suggesting Hg toxicity. Essential trace elements showed little variation across species, but epidermal Se was notably low in Burrunan dolphins. Due to ongoing freshwater skin disease/health concerns, and the importance Se plays in epidermal health, it is recommended that epidermal Se and skin health are further investigated within the Burrunan dolphin. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) typically inhabit deep oceanic waters from tropical to temperate waters worldwide. However, their ecology and behavior remain poorly understood. We investigated site fidelity and social structure of rough-toothed dolphins using photo-identification data collected between 2014 and 2022 in the continental shelf waters of the southwestern coast of Mexico. A total of 133 groups of rough-toothed dolphins were recorded. Mean group size was 4.9 individuals (SD = 4.5), and dolphins were encountered in waters of a mean depth of 110 m (SD = 188). Of 228 individuals identified, 55% were observed once, 39% were seen between two and four times, and 6% were seen five times or more. Site fidelity analysis suggests three levels of site fidelity: transients, occasional visitors, and regular visitors, which are likely to affect the social structure. Through network analysis, nonrandom social patterns were identified (S = 1.25 ± 0.26) and dolphins exhibited both preferences and avoidances of social partners. Cluster analysis suggested significant divisions within the population (Q = 0.43 ± 0.05). Despite limitations related to sample size and design, this preliminary study suggests that rough-toothed dolphins are best characterized by a fission-fusion society, which is similar to most coastal delphinid populations. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) is a marine mammal that lives in relatively small populations. The geographic ranges of this species are susceptible to the effects of human activities, thereby necessitating conservation efforts to prevent extinction. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the daily quality of dolphin sperm after several days of refrigeration. The sperm of two male dolphins were stored at 4oC for 4 days, and the quality was observed daily to determine the motility, viability, membrane integrity, and sperm abnormalities. Sperm samples were divided into four groups, consisting of two centrifuged followed by the removal of seminal plasma, and two groups without centrifugation, containing 100x106 and 200x106 sperm/ml each. After liquid storage, the motility of sperm was 63-75% with no significant reduction in the first 3 days. Sperm viability following storage was 65-75% and the percentage with abnormal morphology ranged from 2-6%. Furthermore, there was no significant increase in abnormal morphology of sperm on any day of storage for 3 days. Sperm membrane integrity was 36-49%, with no significant reduction in the membrane integrity in the first 2 days. There was no significant difference in sperm quality, although centrifugation and removal of seminal plasm had a slight effect. The results of this study showed that Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin sperm could be stored for a short period as liquid storage while maintaining a quality that allows for future use. © Ilmu Kelautan, UNDIP.

ABSTRACT: Understanding interactions between small-scale fishers and endangered dolphins is crucial for informing coexistence strategies. We investigated the perceptions and encounters of 123 Amazonian fishers in the Tapajós River (Brazil) with two endangered freshwater dolphins, Sotalia fluviatilis and Inia geoffrensis. Furthermore, 51 fishers self-documented 2,013 fish landings over one year. All interviewed fishers reported regular encounters with dolphins during fishing activities, with landings and interviews showing a partial overlap in fish species caught by fishers and cited as consumed by dolphins. Fishers highlighted that only I. geoffrensis disrupts fishing activities, causing gillnet damage and stealing fish from nets. To avoid interaction, fishers refrain from fishing an average of 3.7 times per month, potentially leading to 14.8 to 18.5 % decrease in total fish harvest. Economic losses were reported by 63 fishers, totaling an estimated US$ 50.3 ± 30.1 per month per fisher, which is equivalent to three days of fishing income. The estimated bycatch of dolphins was 10 per year across the studied area (71 % from I. geoffrensis). While 86 fishers considered dolphins beneficial, 62 viewed them as harmful. Fishers who fish more frequently are more likely to consider dolphins “good”. The results revealed dolphins’ positive contribution to fisheries by reducing efforts and safeguarding fish, while causing harm through gillnet damage. Negative perceptions are linked to individual economic losses, while positive perceptions stem from perceived collective benefits. By emphasizing dolphins’ collective advantages in riverine communities, they can be a flagship species for conservation, leveraging their appeal and function as umbrella species for maintaining ecosystem functions, such as healthy fish stocks. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: In this article, the last two sentences in the Results section under "Contemporary geneflow" were incorrectly given as: Interestingly, although the estimated migration rate remained similar when excluding eastern Scottish samples (m = 3265), the direction of geneflow reversed to a unidirectional influx from western Scotland and Ireland to the North Sea. All other migration rates did not exceed 0.06 migrants per generation and were therefore considered low. But should have been: Interestingly, although the estimated migration rate remained similar when excluding eastern Scottish samples (m = 0.3265), the direction of geneflow reversed to a unidirectional influx from western Scotland and Ireland to the North Sea. All other migration rates did not exceed 0.06 migrants per generation and were therefore considered low. The given value for the estimated migration rate between the two mentioned groups was wrong. In the text it says m = 3265 when it should be m = 0.3265 instead. The original article has been corrected. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins often conceal behavioral signs of illness until they reach an advanced stage. Motivated by the efficacy of vocal biomarkers in human health diagnostics, we utilized supervised machine learning methods to assess various model architectures’ effectiveness in classifying dolphin health status from the acoustic features of their whistles. A gradient boosting classifier achieved a 72.3% accuracy in distinguishing between normal and abnormal health states—a significant improvement over chance (permutation test; 1000 iterations, p < 0.001). The model was trained on 30,693 whistles from 15 dolphins and the test set (15%) totaled 3612 ‘normal’ and 1775 ‘abnormal’ whistles. The classifier identified the health status of the dolphin from the whistles features with 72.3% accuracy, 73.2% recall, 56.1% precision, and a 63.5% F1 score. These findings suggest the encoding of internal health information within dolphin whistle features, with indications that the severity of illness correlates with classification accuracy, notably in its success for identifying ‘critical’ cases (94.2%). The successful development of this diagnostic tool holds promise for furnishing a passive, non-invasive, and cost-effective means for early disease detection in bottlenose dolphins. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory disease is one of the main causes for morbidity and mortality in cetaceans, which highlights the importance of understanding normal lung function and how it may impede homeostasis, and diving capacity. In addition, the use of breathing frequency as a proxy for metabolic rate requires a better estimate of the normal range of tidal volume, respiratory flow, and breath durations. In the current study, we use data on clinically healthy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) collected over a decade to define how lung function varies with body mass, age, and sex while in water or during voluntary beaching. The data show that tidal volume consistently varies with body mass both during spontaneous and forced breaths both in water and while beached. Both peak expiratory and inspiratory flow varies with body mass, but also in some circumstances with sex and age. Total and inspiratory breath durations only varied with body mass during forced breaths on land. Expired tidal volume varied with both body mass and either total or expiratory breath duration. These data provide baseline for respiratory function in healthy bottlenose dolphins and suggest that either total or expiratory breath duration provide a useful proxy for tidal volume. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Pathogenic Leptospira species are globally important zoonotic pathogens capable of infecting a wide range of host species. In marine mammals, reports of Leptospira have predominantly been in pinnipeds, with isolated reports of infections in cetaceans. Case presentation: On 28 June 2021, a 150.5 cm long female, short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis delphis) stranded alive on the coast of southern California and subsequently died. Gross necropsy revealed multifocal cortical pallor within the reniculi of the kidney, and lymphoplasmacytic tubulointerstitial nephritis was observed histologically. Immunohistochemistry confirmed Leptospira infection, and PCR followed by lfb1 gene amplicon sequencing suggested that the infecting organism was L.kirschneri. Leptospira DNA capture and enrichment allowed for whole-genome sequencing to be conducted. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the causative agent was a previously undescribed, divergent lineage of L.kirschneri. Conclusions: We report the first detection of pathogenic Leptospira in a short-beaked common dolphin, and the first detection in any cetacean in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Renal lesions were consistent with leptospirosis in other host species, including marine mammals, and were the most significant lesions detected overall, suggesting leptospirosis as the likely cause of death. We identified the cause of the infection as L.kirschneri, a species detected only once before in a marine mammal – a northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) of the northeastern Pacific. These findings raise questions about the mechanism of transmission, given the obligate marine lifestyle of cetaceans (in contrast to pinnipeds, which spend time on land) and the commonly accepted view that Leptospira are quickly killed by salt water. They also raise important questions regarding the source of infection, and whether it arose from transmission among marine mammals or from terrestrial-to-marine spillover. Moving forward, surveillance and sampling must be expanded to better understand the extent to which Leptospira infections occur in the marine ecosystem and possible epidemiological linkages between and among marine and terrestrial host species. Generating Leptospira genomes from different host species will yield crucial information about possible transmission links, and our study highlights the power of new techniques such as DNA enrichment to illuminate the complex ecology of this important zoonotic pathogen. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean-cultured cells are a promising tool for life science research. Most cells used in cetacean research are derived from the skin and kidneys. However, cell cultures from various organs are required for more flexible cetacean research. Primary cultures were prepared from kidney, intestinal, and lung tissues using a simple tissue fragment culture method from a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). Kidney and intestinal cells were mostly epithelial-like, whereas lung cells were mostly fibroblast-like. The simple tissue fragment culture method presented in this study will be useful for expanding cetacean cell resources. Culturing allogeneic cell models is expected to introduce a flexible in vitro approach to cetacean research. © The Society for In Vitro Biology 2024.

ABSTRACT: Marine wildlife tourism is known to affect target species across multiple spatial and temporal scales, from short-term behavioral responses to changes in relative abundance and habitat use patterns. However, despite a growing number of population-, community-, and group-level studies, a limited number of them have focused their research on individual responses to wildlife tourism, particularly on free-ranging cetaceans. Between 2018 and 2020, we investigated the behavioral responses of 20 non-provisioned bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) to recreational scuba divers in Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia, to understand whether these individuals that had been repeatedly exposed to scuba diving tourism on at least one year exhibited temperament traits along the ‘shyness-boldness’ axis. We also considered potential variation in boldness in relation to sex, age, and tourist-site fidelity. The study documented individual differences in the dolphins’ boldness. There was no variation in boldness according to sex and tourist-site fidelity, but age significantly influenced the dolphins’ boldness with immature dolphins being bolder than mature individuals. The more extreme case of boldness involved four dolphins that tolerated repeated physical interactions with scuba divers. In Rangiroa, scuba diving tourism promotes repeated intrusive interactions with dolphins that might make bold individuals particularly vulnerable to collateral threats associated with human activities. It is therefore crucial to consider individual variation in the dolphins’ behavioral responses to tourism to implement optimal tourism management measures. We suggest in the discussion recommendations to help minimize the risks for both the dolphins and humans associated with repeated close interactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Disturbance events can alter a community's association patterns, which can influence mating tactics. The St. Johns River (SJR) bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops erebennus) community was impacted by the 2013–2015 unusual mortality event (UME), caused by cetacean morbillivirus, through mortality and social network changes. We analyzed male alliance stability and behavior from April 2011 through March 2017 with respect to the UME. During the UME, 12 first-order alliance dyads ended due to a partner's death or disappearance. Alliance tactics varied: forming second-order alliances (n = 21 alliances; teams of first-order alliances), forming first-order alliances (n = 13 alliances) or remaining unallied after an alliance dissolved (n = 8 individuals). During- and post-UME, fewer allied males formed second-order alliances (55%) compared to pre-UME (68%). While the UME likely indirectly influenced alliance behavior through demographic changes, female presence and breeding season consistently influenced alliance associations and consortships (cooperatively flanking a female), indicating a reproductive function for SJR alliances. Increased consortships when a second-order partner was present suggests second-order alliances may provide consortship support against rival males. These results enhance our understanding of multilevel alliance reproductive benefits and demonstrate the adaptability of male mating tactics in response to disturbances resulting in demographic changes. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Following the X-Press Pearl maritime disaster off the coast of Sri Lanka, a stranded spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) was recovered, and the cause of death was investigated. Post-mortem examinations revealed evidence of by-catch, but a natural coinfection with dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and gammaherpesvirus was detected by further analyses, marking the first documented case of a dual viral infection in this species within the region. Molecular diagnostics, including PCR and sequencing, were performed on tissue imprints collected on FTA® cards, confirming the presence of DMV in the prescapular lymph node and gammaherpesvirus in the lesions in the oral cavity. The concurrent detection of DMV and gammaherpesvirus raises significant concerns regarding the potential impacts of environmental stressors, such as chemical pollutants from the X-Press Pearl maritime disaster, on exacerbating susceptibility to viral infections in marine mammals. These findings highlight the need for ongoing surveillance of cetacean populations in the Indian Ocean to better understand pathogen circulation and health and conservation implications of anthropogenic activities on the marine ecosystem. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the population viability of Sotalia guianensis in the Cananéia Estuarine-Lagoon Complex, considering current and potential future scenarios. Simulations, using VORTEX software v. 10.5.5.0, spanned 100 years and were iterated 1000 times. Scenarios encompassed adjustments to demographic and environmental factors, evaluating population trajectories (baseline; increase fisheries; increase tourism; and increase harbour activity scenarios). Findings revealed a potential stochastic growth rate and population stabilization in baseline and increase tourism scenarios when major threats were absent. Conversely, increase fishing and harbour activity scenarios exhibited population decline, leading to eventual extinction within 100 years. Projected growth rates for all Scenarios were 0.0298 (SD=0.0424), −0.2650 (SD=0.2825), 0.0294 (SD=0.0654), and −0.0334 (SD=0.1145) respectively, with extinction probabilities of 0.0 for baseline and increase tourism scenarios, 1.0 for increase fishing scenario with mean estimated extinction time at 14 years, and 0.4430 for increase harbour activity scenario with mean estimated extinction time at 80.1 years. Sensitivity testing identified the percentage of adult females breeding and female mortality as the parameters most significantly impacting population trends. The simulations provided important insights into the primary factors impacting the viability of Sotalia guianensis and lay the groundwork for future population assessments and conservation plans. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: To capture prey more efficiently, cetaceans can display a wide range of foraging tactics to separate individual prey. Barrier feeding tactics are performed to restrict prey movements, using natural and non-natural barriers and some species can even create barriers with their own bodies. Mud ring feeding has been observed in bottlenose dolphins in Florida Bay and in Chetumal-Corozal Bay, where ring-maker dolphins create ring-shaped mud plumes to encircle fish schools. Here, we document for the first time Guiana dolphins performing the mud ring feeding behaviour in the Cananéia estuarine system, in the southern portion of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 11 dolphins were recorded in four expeditions through aerial footage engaging in the behaviour. These findings expand our knowledge about the behavioural plasticity of the species and builds upon existing records of mud ring feeding behaviour in cetaceans. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Diving marine mammals are a diverse group of semi- to completely aquatic species. Some species are targets of conservation and rehabilitation efforts; other populations are permanently housed under human care and may contribute to clinical and biomedical investigations. Veterinary medical care for species under human care, at times, may necessitate the use of general anesthesia for diagnostic and surgical indications. However, the unique physiologic and anatomic adaptations of one representative diving marine mammal, the bottlenose dolphin, present several challenges in providing ventilatory and cardiovascular support to maintain adequate organ perfusion under general anesthesia. The goal of this review is to highlight the unique cardiopulmonary adaptations of the completely aquatic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), and to identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of how those adaptations influence their physiology and pose potential challenges for sedation and anesthesia of these mammals. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: To reduce heat loss underwater, marine mammals cover their bodies with insulation. Cetaceans in particular rely solely on blubber for insulation which has low conductivity. Blubber establishes a great thermal gradient between the warmer body core and cooler body surface, reducing heat transfer to the environment. A temperature gradient within the blubber determines the conductive heat transfer from the body trunk, where conduction and convection are the primary heat transfer mechanisms in cetaceans. Therefore, measuring the temperature at the innermost part of the blubber, i.e., the temperature at the muscle–blubber interface (Tmbi), can enhance our understanding of thermoregulatory mechanisms in cetaceans. In thermoregulation, activity-induced heat produced by increased muscle metabolism is another factor that plays an important role, however, the effects of activity on Tmbi have not been investigated in cetaceans. To assess this relationship in free-swimming cetaceans, we measured Tmbi and activity levels in a captive Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) using an implantable biologging device. Results: Tmbi and activity data were analyzed for 11 days. The average Tmbi was 35.1 ± 0.6 ºC and the temperature gradient between Tmbi and the water temperature was 13.0 ± 0.7 ºC. Tmbi was higher during the daytime and lower in the early morning. The variation in Tmbi was best explained by both the activity levels and time of day. Tmbi did not simply increase with activity levels; it appeared to remain relatively constant at most activity levels. However, Tmbi appeared to decrease when the animal was inactive and increase when it was intensely active. Conclusion: Our results provide important insights into how a dolphin regulates its body temperature underwater. Thermal insulation by blubber and heat production by activity were suggested to play important roles in thermoregulation. Whole-body heat dissipation might be used to regulate temperature increases when heat production is excessive due to intense activity. During inactive periods, decreasing temperature gradient may help reduce heat loss from the body. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Aim: This study investigates the biogeographic patterns of Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) in the Eastern North Pacific based on long-term passive acoustic records. We aim to elucidate the ecological and behavioural significance of distinct echolocation click types and their implications for population delineation, geographic distribution, environmental adaptation and management. Location: Eastern North Pacific Ocean. Time Period: 2005–2021. Major Taxa Studied: Pacific white-sided dolphin. Methods: Over 50 cumulative years of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data from 14 locations were analyzed using a deep neural network to classify two distinct Pacific white-sided dolphin echolocation click types. The study assessed spatial, diel, seasonal and interannual patterns of the two click types, correlating them with major environmental drivers such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and modeling long-term spatial-seasonal patterns. Results: Distinct spatial, diel and seasonal patterns were observed for each click type. Significant biogeographical shifts in presence were observed following the 2014–2016 marine heatwave event. Main Conclusions: Distinct spatial distributions of the two click types support the hypothesis that Pacific white-sided dolphins produce population-specific echolocation clicks. Seasonal and diel patterns suggest spatiotemporal niche partitioning between the populations in Southern California. Interannual changes, notably initiated during the 2014–2016 marine heatwave, indicate climate-driven range expansions and contractions related to gradual tropicalization of the Southern California Bight. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The prevalence and evolution of foamy viruses (FVs) have become the focus of research because of the risk of new zoonotic diseases. FVs have been isolated from various mammals and exhibit long-term co-speciation with their hosts. They also appear to be mild and nonpathogenic to their hosts. However, they may increase the risk of infection by other pathogens or exacerbate the symptoms of other diseases. Based on the data obtained using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we amplified and obtained the complete genomes of the two new FVs discovered in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the South American sea lion (Otaria byronia) at the Qingdao Polar Haichang Ocean Park. Analysis and prediction of the novel FV's genomic structure revealed that it was consistent with that of the known mammalian FVs. The polmerase (pol) genes of the novel OFVoby_1 and DFVttr_1 showed less than 61.87 % and 61.83 % amino acid identity, respectively, with other known FVs belonging to the Retroviridae family. The host was likely to carry the FV for a considerable amount of time, as evidenced by the different times DFVttr_1 was discovered. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the pol of OFVoby_1 and DFVttr_1 closely clustered with the FVs of Simiispumavirus and Felispumavirus, respectively. However, they both displayed distinct branches. According to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) FV classification criteria, FVs carried by dolphins and sea lions belong to two new genera within the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily. Using Bayesian analysis to simultaneously determine divergence dates and phylogenetic relationships revealed unique FVs with a divergence date of approximately 60 million years. This study helps us understand the FVs evolution and provides a scientific basis for future investigations into animal-borne infectious diseases. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Lymphoid and haematopoietic neoplasms are rare in cetaceans. This report describes intravascular lymphoma in an adult common dolphin that presented with neurological signs prior to stranding. Intravascular lymphoma is a rare neoplasm previously recorded in humans, dogs, a cat and a horse. The condition is characterized by intravascular neoplastic lymphocytic proliferation, the sequelae of which are dependent on the organ affected. Key pathological findings in this case included multifocal cerebrocortical malacia secondary to vascular occlusion associated with intravascular neoplastic lymphocytic proliferation. Immunohistochemistry supported a T-cell phenotype similar to that observed in dogs. The neurological presentation was consistent with that seen in other species in which the central nervous system is involved. The aetiology and pathogenesis have not been established in other species and although no further investigations were made in this common dolphin, this report adds to the short list of species affected by this rare neoplasm. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Since winter 2016, an increase in strandings of small cetaceans has been recorded along the French Atlantic seaboard. This mortality, which concerns mostly the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), is mainly due to bycatch in fishing gears. Highly vulnerable towards this issue, this protected species is more and more threatened in the Bay of Biscay. Fine scale knowledge on fisheries practices, which are ever evolving, is paramount to address the bycatch issue. The objective of this study was to identify the individual trajectories of static netters flying the French flag and to highlight possible changes in their practices between 2015 and 2019, during the winter period. An analysis of AIS data from vessels over 15 m of length, using a clustering method (HCPC), enabled us to define a typology of the static net fishery trajectories. The possible main trajectories of static netters flying the French flag were identified. Among these, one trajectory was linear with a constant navigation path and was used by offshore gillnetters targeting hake. This trajectory increased in frequency between 2015 and 2017. This study improves knowledge on practices of passive fishing gears that present a risk of short-beaked common dolphin bycatch such as gillnets and trammel nets in the Bay of Biscay. Further analysis of AIS data from other years and fishing fleets, adding environmental data or even dolphin distribution, are needed for a full understanding of the bycatch issue and towards the implementation of efficient mitigation measures. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This case report presents the first molecular identification of a gammacoronavirus in a free-ranging striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) that was found stranded along the Croatian coastline in 2022. The dolphin exhibited a concurrent infection with cetacean morbillivirus. The gammacoronavirus strain was amplified and sequenced from heart tissue imprinted on an FTA®card, revealing a notable genetic distance (approximately 8%) from previously characterized cetacean gammacoronaviruses. This finding highlights the importance of including gammacoronaviruses in routine diagnostics for stranded dolphins to gather epidemiological data on their prevalence and potential role in causing disease in cetaceans. This study sets the premises for a further understanding of the diversity and distribution of gammacoronaviruses in marine mammals and highlights the necessity for ongoing surveillance of emerging infectious diseases in wild populations. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Genetic data have become an important asset to enhance the delimitation of cetacean species, subspecies, and populations, considering the difficulties in obtaining representative morphological data. The franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei (Gervais & d’Orbigny 1844), is the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Genetic studies have shown a deep genetic divergence between franciscanas from the northern and southern parts of the range; thus, it was proposed that they should be considered two Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESU). Morphological and ecological data also suggest differences across the species range. We used genetic data from samples collected throughout the species distribution (N = 399) to test hypotheses of intraspecific differentiation that could reflect the existence of subspecies within P. blainvillei. We applied the divergence and diagnosability criteria for recognition of cetacean subspecies, based on mitochondrial control region sequences. The net between-group nucleotide divergence (dA = 0.0074) and the percent diagnosable (99%) indicate that the franciscana’s North and South ESU meet the criteria to be recognized as subspecies. Morphological and ecological evidence also support the two subspecies claim. Therefore, we propose a trinomial and provide diagnoses for the new subspecies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans have adapted to aquatic life by evolving various anatomic and physiologic traits, but biological defense mechanisms specific to aquatic mammals that protect against pathogenic microorganisms in the aquatic environment have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in bottlenose dolphins in response to various chemotactic factors and compared the migration response with that of terrestrial animals such as cows and humans to characterize biological defense mechanisms unique to cetaceans. Bottlenose dolphin neutrophils showed strong chemotactic activity toward zymosan-activated serum and recombinant human interleukin-8 but no chemotaxis toward N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or leukotriene B4 at any concentration examined. Bovine and human neutrophils showed the strongest chemotactic activity at 37°C, whereas chemotactic activity declined significantly at 15°C and 4°C. By contrast, bottlenose dolphin neutrophils exhibited relatively strong chemotactic activity even at 15°C. These results suggest that the mechanism by which bottlenose dolphin neutrophils detect chemoattractants differs from that of terrestrial mammals and that the immune system of cetaceans may be cold-adaptive, allowing the animals to exert robust host defense responses in aquatic habitats, which tend to be colder than the terrestrial environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring the nutritional health of cetaceans has become increasingly important in a changing environment, where multiple stressors impact animals. Particularly for those species that require consumption of energy-dense prey, such as the common dolphin. Thus far, no uniform measure for monitoring body condition has been recommended across cetaceans, and species-specific measures may need to be developed if employed as a population condition indicator under Descriptor 1 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Here, nine morphometric body condition indices were applied to long-term common dolphin stranding data sets originating from Ireland and the UK. We report a recent decline in the nutritional health of common dolphins in the Celtic Seas ecoregion comparing animals from 2017 to 2019 to animals from 1990 to 2006, with an increase in cases of animals dying due to starvation. Using ordinal regression trees, ventral blubber thickness (VBT) was identified as the most important index to predict nutritional status, defined at necropsy, followed by the scaled mass index (SMI). Using generalised linear models, both the VBT and SMI indices differentiated individuals that died from chronic and acute causes of death (i.e., bycatch), where animals in chronic conditions had significantly thinner VBT and lower SMI. Both significant temporal and seasonal patterns in VBT were identified, with poorer body conditions observed during the autumn and better body conditions observed during the spring, as well as an overall decline detected in VBT during the study period. While VBT was positively correlated with total body length, SMI showed the opposite trend. The VBT index is recommended for monitoring nutritional health within the species when total body length and season are considered. Further research is needed to understand the underlying causes for the observed decline, including shifts in prey availability and/or quality, to inform targeted conservation management strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In the last decade, the frequency of the use of the Bonnet Carré Spillway (BCS) to divert water from the Mississippi River by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has dramatically increased. The BCS is designed to protect the city of New Orleans, Louisiana from levee breaches and devastating floods. In 2011 and 2019, during extreme flood events, the USACE diverted 6.4 trillion gallons and 10.07 trillion gallons of Mississippi River water into Lake Borgne and Biloxi Marsh, Louisiana, and the Mississippi Sound, Mississippi. The 2011 and 2019 diversions and lower-discharge diversions in other years have coincided with high freshwater discharges of coastal Mississippi streams, the appearance of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, dolphins) with skin lesions, and large numbers of stranded dolphins. To determine what might be causing dolphin skin lesions and strandings, we investigated BCS and coastal stream discharges between 2010 and 2021 as possible drivers. Generalized additive, kriging, and seasonal-trend decomposition using loess models showed that the prevalence of skin lesions in the western Mississippi Sound and Biloxi Marsh was significantly related to BCS discharge and not to stream discharge. From 2010 to 2021, the frequency of stranded dolphins across the Mississippi Sound was significantly related to BCS discharges, while coastal stream discharges had localized effects. Between 2018 and 2019, the relationship between the frequency of dolphin strandings and BCS discharge was highly significant. In this model, the relationship between dolphin strandings and stream discharge was not significant. This research provides evidence that freshwater diversions through the BCS likely increase the prevalence of skin lesions on live dolphins, strandings, and mortality in the Mississippi Sound. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Aquatic mammals in Indonesia are officially protected. However, there is a lack of research on these mammals, particularly in relation to potential disease-causing bacteria. A study was conducted in a conservation pond to address this gap, where swab samples were taken from the blowholes of aquatic mammals. The focus was on identifying bacteria that could potentially cause infectious diseases in these animals. The results revealed V. parahaemolyticus bacterial isolates, which showed a 98% similarity to the registered V. parahaemolyticus in NCBI. These bacterial isolates exhibited hemolysin properties and demonstrated resistance to trimethoprim, streptomycin, cephalothin, and penicillin antibiotics. © 2024, Bogor Agricultural University.

ABSTRACT: Demographic processes can substantially affect a species' response to changing ecological conditions, necessitating the combined consideration of genetic responses to environmental variables and neutral genetic variation. Using a seascape genomics approach combined with population demographic modelling, we explored the interplay of demographic and environmental factors that shaped the current population structure in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) along the Western Australian coastline. We combined large-scale environmental data gathered via remote sensing with RADseq genomic data from 133 individuals at 19 sampling sites. Using population genetic and outlier detection analyses, we identified three distinct genetic clusters, coinciding with tropical, subtropical and temperate provincial bioregions. In contrast to previous studies, our demographic models indicated that populations occupying the paleo-shoreline split into two demographically independent lineages before the last glacial maximum (LGM). A subsequent split after the LGM 12—15 kya gave rise to the Shark Bay population, thereby creating the three currently observed clusters. Although multi-locus heterozygosity declined from north to south, dolphins from the southernmost cluster inhabiting temperate waters had higher heterozygosity in potentially adaptive loci compared to dolphins from subtropical and tropical waters. These findings suggest ongoing adaptation to cold-temperate waters in the southernmost cluster, possibly linked to distinct selective pressures between the different bioregions. Our study demonstrated that in the marine realm, without apparent physical boundaries, only a combined approach can fully elucidate the intricate environmental and genetic interactions shaping the evolutionary trajectory of marine mammals. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals near coastlines are highly vulnerable to human activities like rapid industrialisation, port construction, and sea reclamation, which can alter their habitat use. This study examines changes in the habitat use of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in the western Pearl River Estuary (WPRE) by employing a kernel density estimation model that considers physical barriers. Sighting records from systematic surveys in 2007–2008 and 2019–2020, along with remote sensing data, were used to analyse changes in shorelines and areas affected by maritime projects since 1973. Approximately 552.98 km2 of water was permanently lost to reclamation between 1973 and 2020. In 2007–2008, dolphins preferred natural shorelines, while reclamation drove them away from artificial ones. By 2019–2020, their core habitat had decreased by two-thirds, with some areas disappearing, likely due to aquaculture expansion. These results highlight the importance of adopting improved environmental assessment methodologies in the planning and regulation of aquaculture activities in the WPRE to better protect the dolphin habitat. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a small cetacean endemic to the coastal waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Due to its restricted distribution, it is subject to high bycatch mortality in the gillnets used for commercial and artisanal fishing. The rehabilitation of the franciscana is still a major challenge, as most attempts to rehabilitate stranded animals have failed. This study aims to present the case of the rehabilitation of a franciscana dolphin calf, stranded in San Clemente del Tuyú, Argentina, at the beginning of the predation period. The feeding strategy and nutritional profile at different stages during the 88 days of rehabilitation are meticulously detailed. Its diet was prepared by hand based on studies of milk composition, the feeding ecology of franciscana in Argentinean waters, and previous records of the Fundación Mundo Marino Rehabilitation Center. The diets were designed to meet the nutritional needs of franciscana dolphins. In addition, the hematological, cytological, and fecal analyses recorded during the rehabilitation are presented. Although the animal could not be released, due to its death, this report provides baseline information that can improve the ability of veterinarians to care for debilitated, live-stranded dolphins. This information may also be useful in the implementation and development of healthcare protocols for this species. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding reproductive output and success is integral to the conservation and management of threatened species and populations. Little is known about the reproductive parameters of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis), a species subject to cumulative pressures from anthropogenic threats due to their coastal distribution and strong site fidelity. This study assesses several reproductive parameters, including crude birth, recruitment, fecundity, and calf survival rates, in addition to interbirth intervals of Australian humpback dolphins inhabiting the near-urban embayment of Moreton Bay, Queensland. Between 2014 and 2020, 106 adult females were photographically identified during 222 boat surveys. Of these, 75.5% (n = 80) were observed with calves. Birth seasonality was apparent and coincided with austral autumn and winter months. Interbirth intervals ranged between 1 and >6 years, with an average of 3.1 (SD = 1.1) years if offspring survived. Findings indicate declining fecundity rates (p <.05, M = 0.12, SD = 0.02), relatively low recruitment rates (M = 0.04, SD = 0.01) and calf survival rates to 1 year of age (M = 0.63, SD = 0.15). This study provides a useful baseline that can inform viability assessments and conservation measures, for both this population and others throughout the species range. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Cefpodoxime proxetil is commonly used to treat cetacean patients with suspected or confirmed bacterial infections; however, pharmacokinetic data are needed to guide proper dosing in these species. Cefpodoxime proxetil is a time-dependent, semisynthetic, third-generation cephalosporin, appropriate for once-daily dosing and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in dogs with a broad spectrum of activity including gram-positive and gram-negative species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics of cefpodoxime in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). A sparse-sampling design was used, with serum from dolphins receiving cefpodoxime proxetil at 10 mg/kg orally every 24 h to treat suspected or confirmed bacterial infections. Serum samples (n = 57) from 24 dolphins were analyzed at 12 time points from 0 to 96 h postdose. Serum samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. One- and two-compartment linear models with first order absorption were tested. Covariates including weight, age, and sex were considered for inclusion in the model, and between-subject variability was incorporated. A two-compartment model performed best, where following an oral dose of 10 mg/kg, serum concentration reached a mean maximum concentration of 23.0 µg/ml, mean time to maximum concentration of 5.0 h, and mean half-life of 11.4 h. With daily dosing, accumulation was approximately 18% and steady state was reached by the second dose. Serum protein binding was 82.8% as determined by equilibrium dialysis, similar to plasma protein binding reported in dogs. Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, once-daily oral dosing was systemically absorbed and quickly reached maximum concentrations. The half-life in dolphins appears to be longer than other species studied to date. Given the paucity of antimicrobial pharmacokinetic studies in dolphins, and limited once-daily oral antibiotic options for this species, these data are helpful for clinicians to make informed antimicrobial choices.

ABSTRACT: For 88 years, biologists and engineers have sought to understand the hydrodynamics enabling dolphins to swim at speeds seemingly beyond their energetic capabilities, a phenomenon known as Gray’s paradox. Hydromechanical models calculating the drag of swimming dolphins estimated power requirements for sustained high-speed swimming, which were physiologically impossible. Using an uncrewed aerial vehicle, we calculated the total power of free-ranging dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) at speeds from 0.9 to 6.9 m s-1, deriving drag coefficients (Cd) and drag. Our results showed that the Cd decreased exponentially with speed, reducing drag by up to 89% at speeds >2 m s-1, with an additional 17% reduction during porpoising (>4.0 m s-1). At 6.9 m s-1, drag was 32 N, with a power of 15.8 W kg-1, nearly identical to the mass-specific allometric prediction for the maximum aerobic capacity of other mammals and physiologically possible. The Cd at speeds >2.5 m s-1 indicated reduced turbulence in the boundary layer around the dolphin’s body, thereby reducing drag. The ability of dusky dolphins to swim at sustained high speeds resulted from an exponential decrease in Cd, which was further reduced by porpoising, thereby explaining the low drag and locomotory power that resolved Gray’s paradox. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: False killer whales, striped dolphins, and Pacific white-sided dolphins have been targeted by dolphin fisheries in the coastal waters off Japan. Annual catch quotas are allocated on the basis of past abundance estimates, but those estimates were unpublished or more than 30 years old. Here, we reanalyzed the line-transect data collected from the sighting survey on the Pacific coast of Japan from 1985 to 2021 and estimated the past and latest abundances of those three species using a standard distance sampling approach. The surveys were conducted as part of the JAFRACSS-SC (Japan Fisheries and Education Agency Cetacean Sighting Survey-Small Cetacean Survey Program). This program mainly targets other fishery-targeted cetacean species and, thus, covers only a part of the above three species’ distribution ranges. As a result, we obtained the latest abundance estimates of 4105 false killer whales, 84,657 striped dolphins, and 28,052 white-sided dolphins. Considering the current estimates represent only a part of the entire population size and that annual catch records did not largely exceed potential biological removals calculated based on these abundances, the current harvest level will not lead to a severe depletion or extinction for these three species. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japanese Society of Fisheries Science 2024.

ABSTRACT: Environmental DNA (eDNA) is frequently used for detecting species and describing biodiversity through metabarcoding techniques. More recently, there has been emerging evidence that eDNA can be used to investigate intraspecific variability, providing novel pathways to explore population genetics questions. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between true intraspecific variation and PCR/sequence error, and the presence of DNA from multiple individuals makes using traditional frequency-based approaches challenging. Here, we explore how eDNA can be used to investigate population structure of Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), an endemic, endangered, and culturally important (taonga) species. In doing so, we present a simple and effective method to filter out noise due to PCR/sequence error and show how treating haplotype detections equally can provide similar results to frequency-based approaches from traditional sampling methods. Over the 2022/23 Austral summer, we collected 85 water samples close to Hector's dolphins, and three negative controls, across three areas on the east coast of Aotearoa New Zealand's South Island: Banks Peninsula (n = 41), Timaru (n = 33), and Dunedin (n = 14). We targeted a 348 bp region of the cetacean D-loop in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and obtained positive detections in 68 (77%) water samples, confidently identifying seven haplotypes across the study area. The occurrence of specific haplotypes and the overall frequencies in Banks Peninsula and Timaru matched well with previous tissue-based studies and were similar to other East Coast South Island (ECSI) subpopulations. In Dunedin, however, our results indicate a closer relationship to South Coast populations, suggesting that the membership within the ECSI population be reconsidered, which has implications for how this subpopulation is managed. We show that eDNA sampling can be used to elucidate matrilineal population structure for Hector's dolphin and provide a simple method that could be applied to other eDNA-based studies of any taxa. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Like other odontocetes, Risso’s dolphins actively emit clicks and passively listen to the echoes during echolocation. However, the head anatomy of Risso’s dolphins differs from that of other odontocetes by a unique vertical cleft along the anterior surface of the forehead and a differently-shaped lower jaw. In this study, 3D finite-element sound reception and production models were constructed based on computed tomography (CT) data of a deceased Risso’s dolphin. Our results were verified by finding good agreement with experimental measurements of hearing sensitivity. Moreover, the acoustic pathway for sounds to travel from the seawater into the dolphin’s tympanoperiotic complexes (TPCs) was computed. The gular reception mechanism, previously discovered in Delphinus delphis and Ziphius cavirostris, was also found in this species. The received sound pressure levels and relative displacement at TPC surfaces were compared between the cases with and without the mandibular fats or mandible. The results demonstrate a pronounced wave-guiding role of the mandibular fats and a limited bone-conductor role of the mandible. For sound production modelling, we digitally filled the cleft with neighbouring soft tissues, creating a hypothetical ‘cleftless’ head. Comparison between sound travelling through a ‘cleftless’ head vs. an original head indicates that the distinctive cleft plays a limited role in biosonar sound propagation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A 15-y-old captive-born female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) had slowly progressive lethargy, inappetence, and pallor of the oral mucosa. Serial hemograms and serum biochemistry analysis revealed hemolyzed plasma, gradually severe anemia with reticulocytosis, spherocytosis, pronounced neutrophilia with left shift and toxic change, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Urinalysis identified both hemoglobinuria and bilirubinuria. Hyperglobulinemia with polyclonal gammopathy was evident by protein electrophoresis, and the saline agglutination test was positive. Splenomegaly and hyperechogenic liver were also observed on ultrasound. These findings meet the diagnostic criteria established for immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in small animals, which is extremely rare in cetacean species, and, to our knowledge, has not been fully documented. Several potential triggers of a secondary IMHA were ruled out, including the most common cetacean virus, exposure to new drugs, and recent vaccination events. Following recommendations from companion animal medicine, immunosuppressive therapy was implemented and proved effective in this bottlenose dolphin; the CBC returned to normal after 3 mo of treatment. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding early life history events within a population is imperative for developing effective conservation and management practices, particularly for vulnerable species in degraded environments with high environmental variability. Here, we first investigated the lifetime record of trace element (TE) accumulation in the teeth of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins from the Pearl River Estuary, China, using in-situ laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry microanalysis, and further explored the suitability of teeth TEs as bioindicators of critical life stages. A total of 26 TEs were detected in the teeth of eight dolphins, with concentrations ranging from 0.003 ± 0.003 μg/g (Be) to 522,405.9 ± 44,690.3 (Ca) μg/g. The varied TE composition in teeth of the dolphins may be related to environmental exposure or the species-specific accumulation of TEs. Generalized linear mixed models showed that the accumulation of nearly half of the detected TEs (V, Fe, Co, Zn, Ga, As, Mo, Sn, Sb, Ba, and Bi) in the dolphin teeth is sex-specific. Temporal analyses revealed that the concentrations of Cu, As, Sr, Ba, and Bi demonstrate age-related changes in metabolic demands and elimination efficiency. Notably, the ratios of Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca in teeth of the dolphins exhibited clear physiological signals, which reconstructed the time of weaning (3–4 years of age). Moreover, the trends in the ratios of Zn/Ca suggest that female dolphins may reach sexual maturity at 9–11 years of age. These findings provide insights into marine mammal development, emphasizing the need for further research on TE accumulation mechanisms and ecological impacts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: We previously identified surfactant protein D (SP-D) in the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus as a unique evolutionary factor of the cetacean pulmonary immune system. In this short report, recombinant SP-D of bottlenose dolphin (dSP-D) was synthesized in mammalian cells, and its properties were analyzed in vitro. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-carrier or Co-carrier. Sodium dodecyl sulfate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting revealed a 50 kDa major band with minor secondary bands. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like methods revealed that recombinant dSP-D bonded to gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial walls. Our findings suggest the clinical usefulness of dSP-D for cetacean pneumonia. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Sound management of coastal resources is based on science-based decisions. Bottlenose dolphins are found around Puerto Rico; however, limited information exists on the ecology, behavior, sex ratio, distribution patterns, and population structure presenting, challenges in managing the bottlenose dolphin as defined in the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. We sequenced the mitochondrial control region (mtDNA-CR) of 27 live and 11 stranded dolphins from Puerto Rico, five stranded dolphins from Guadeloupe and included sequences from the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. Our genetic data from the new samples indicates the presence of distinct genetic lineages (inshore—represented by coastal individuals) and worldwide-distributed form (represented by both coastal and offshore individuals) in Puerto Rico. DNA divergence between inshore/coastal and offshore haplotypes ranged from 4.34 to 6.58%. All haplotypes from Puerto Rico have been previously reported from the Caribbean and North Atlantic. Genetic analysis yielded a complex population structure without a clear geographic signal; an expected result from a highly mobile marine mammal. A clade consisting exclusively of coastal dolphins of the Caribbean and the western North Atlantic was recovered. Offshore haplotypes from the eastern and western North Atlantic were generally clustered with offshore haplotypes of the Caribbean. Coastal and offshore haplotypes from the Pacific differed from those from the Atlantic. When we partitioned the data by form (coastal vs. offshore) and ocean (Atlantic vs. Pacific), we detected significant population differentiation (FST = 0.4089), indicating limited gene flow between forms and across oceans. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde 2024.

ABSTRACT: Strandings and opportunistic sightings represent an invaluable source of information on cetacean's biodiversity in the Mexican Caribbean. Here, we document the stranding and rescue of two pantropical spotted dolphins Stenella attenuata (mother and male calf) near Tulum (Quintana Roo, Mexico), which died without a clear diagnosis of cause of death. This case confirms the occurrence of S. attenuata, increasing the number of local aquatic mammals to 20. As most of the other small cetaceans in this region, the conservation status of the species remains undefined, and more research is needed to better understand ecological and biological aspects of its population.  © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

ABSTRACT: Information on the biomagnification of organophosphate esters (OPEs) is limited, and the results are inconclusive, mainly because precise predator[sbnd]prey relationships have not been determined. Herein, we first evaluated the biomagnification potential and dietary exposure risk of 15 OPEs in 14 prey species (n = 234) to Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins from the northern South China Sea using quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA). QFASA identified Chinese gizzard shad as the primary prey of dolphins. Among the 15 OPEs, 86.7 % (13/15) had a diet-adjusted biomagnification factor (BMFQFASA) greater than 1, indicating the biomagnification potential between dolphins and their diet. Moreover, BMFQFASA exhibited a considerable positive correlation with the log octanol[sbnd]water partitioning coefficient of OPEs, indicating that lipophilicity may affect the bioamplification of OPEs. Risk assessments showed that although current OPE levels may not pose substantial health risks to dolphins via diet intake, the nondiet-adjusted hazard quotient/hazard index underestimated the exposure risk of OPEs to this vulnerable dolphin species. This study provides novel evidence regarding the biomagnification and dietary exposure risks of OPEs in cetaceans, emphasizing the importance of estimating the dietary composition of predators in such analyses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The determination of 18 metals and metalloids was realized in 4 tissues of 62 Stenella coeruleoalba specimens stranded along the French Mediterranean coastline from 2010 to 2016. While most concentrations were comparable to mean worldwide levels, Hg levels were alarming (1190 μg g−1 dw, in average). The results were discussed together with previous measurements in the same area, from 2002 to 2009. The elements Ni and Pb (−81 % and −88 % in liver in 2010–16 compared to 2002–09), and Cd (−40 % in kidney in 2010–16 compared to 2002–09) as well as V (−79 % in liver in 2013–16 compared to 2010–12), showed promising decreasing trends, and the decrease of Zn and Cu levels below baseline values could indicate a global decreasing burden of metal contaminants. In contrary, Hg dramatically increased in dolphins since 2007 (+135 % in liver in 2010–16 compared to 2002–09), regardless of total length. On the other hand, Se levels increased only slightly since 2012, potentially not offering anymore an efficient protection against Hg, with mean Se-to-Hg molar ratios below unity in most tissues (0.26, 0.56, 1.81, and 0.57 in liver, kidney, lung and muscle, respectively). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are halogenated contaminants found globally. Cetaceans are impacted by these pollutants, and nowadays, it is essential to understand their presence to mitigate their impacts. This study aimed to establish baseline levels of POPs in the blubber of Commerson's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) within the Subantarctic ecosystem. A wide range of POPs concentrations were measured among individuals: ΣPCBs from 289.5 to 15264 ng g−1 lw and ΣDDTs from 540.4 to 17657 ng g−1 lw. Levels of HCB and mirex ranged from 48 to 1703.7 ng g−1 lw and 5.1–1917.4 ng g−1 lw, respectively. The predominant POPs were mid-to high molecular weight PCBs (hexa-PCBs), consistent with other findings in cetaceans of the southern hemisphere. The mean ratio of ΣDDT/ΣPCB was 0.44, with p,p′-DDE/ΣDDT at 0.56, indicating p,p’-DDE as the dominant DDT isomer. Furthermore, differences in POP concentrations were observed based on sexual maturity, with mature males exhibiting higher levels of ƩPCBs, HCB, ƩDDT, and mirex. Age and total body length of animals were strongly correlated with POP concentrations. Our study provides valuable insights into the pollutant status of POPs in the Subantarctic population of Commerson's dolphins inhabiting the southernmost coastal regions of South America. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Recent years have seen a notable rise in dolphin-watching boat activities along the Algarve coast in Portugal, potentially affecting the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) local populations. This study examines the impact of increasing underwater noise levels from these boats on dolphin vocalizations. Field recordings were conducted from June to September 2022, analyzing dolphin whistles in various boat presence scenarios. The results indicate significant changes in whistle-frequency characteristics with boat presence, including increased start, low, and high frequencies, alongside a decrease in the number of inflection points in modulated whistles. The changes might negatively impact dolphin populations viability, underscoring the need for further research. Additionally, improved mitigation strategies may be necessary to reduce the potential negative effects of dolphin watching on cetacean communication and behavior in the Algarve region. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Microcystin (MC), a hepatotoxin produced by cyanobacteria, was introduced into the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, in 2005 through freshwater outflows. Since then, MC has been detected in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife in the lagoon. Potential public health effects associated with MC exposure along the IRL include an increased risk of non-alcoholic liver disease among area residents. Yet, there are limited studies characterizing liver disease, as well as the potential role of MC, in humans and animals in this region. Thus, histopathology reports (n = 133) were reviewed in the stranded common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus truncatus) (n = 156, 2005–2024) to describe liver lesions in this important IRL sentinel. Liver and fecal samples (n = 161) from stranded individuals were screened for MC via an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). These samples were then confirmed via the 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid technique (MMPB) to evaluate whether liver histopathologic lesions were linked to MC exposure. Minimally invasive MC screening methods were also assessed using respiratory swabs and vapor. Inflammation (24%, n = 32), fibrosis (23%, n = 31), lipidosis/vacuolation (11%, n = 15), and necrosis (11%, n = 14) were the most common liver anomalies observed. These non-specific lesions have been reported to be associated with MC exposure in numerous species in the peer-reviewed literature. Ten bottlenose dolphins tested positive for the toxin via ELISA, including two individuals with hepatic lipidosis, but none were confirmed by MMPB. Thus, this study did not provide evidence for MC-induced liver disease in IRL bottlenose dolphins. Other causes should be considered for the lesions observed (e.g., heavy metals, metabolic disease, and endoparasites). Respiratory swabs require further validation as a pre-mortem MC screening tool in free-ranging wildlife. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Endothelial function declines with aging and independently predicts future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Diving also impairs endothelial function in humans. Yet, dolphins, being long-lived mammals adapted to diving, undergo repetitive cycles of tissue hypoxia-reoxygenation and disturbed shear stress without manifesting any apparent detrimental effects, as CVD is essentially nonexistent in these animals. Thus, dolphins may be a unique model of healthy arterial aging and may provide insights into strategies for clinical medicine. Emerging evidence shows that the circulating milieu (bioactive factors in the blood) is at least partially responsible for transducing reductions in age-related endothelial function. To assess whether dolphins have preserved endothelial function with aging because of a protected circulating milieu, we tested if the serum (pool of the circulating milieu) of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) induces the same arterial aging phenotype as the serum of age-equivalent humans. We incubated conduit arteries from young and old mice with dolphin and human serum and measured endothelial function ex vivo via endothelium-dependent dilation to acetylcholine. Although young arteries incubated with serum from midlife/older adult human serum had lower endothelial function, those incubated with dolphin serum consistently maintained high endothelial function regardless of the age of the donor. Thus, studying the arterial health of dolphins could lead to potential novel therapeutic strategies to improve age-related endothelial dysfunction in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate that, unlike serum of midlife/older adult humans, age-matched dolphin serum elicits higher endothelial function ex vivo in young mouse carotid arteries, suggesting that the circulating milieu of bottlenose dolphins may be geroprotective. We propose that dolphins are a novel model to investigate potential novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related endothelial dysfunction in humans. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Assessing persistent organic pollutant (POP) levels across regions helps evaluate environmental health and determine ecological risks. As an apex predator, the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) serves as an excellent model for understanding POP exposure and impact in Eastern North Atlantic marine ecosystems. In this study, we collected biopsy samples of common dolphins in two ecoregions, the pelagic system of Madeira Island (Portugal) (n = 30) and in the continental shelf of Northwest Portugal (n = 14) to analyse organochlorine concentrations (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB) from their blubber. For both ecoregions, PCBs comprised the largest proportion of the total measured organochlorines (60% in Madeira Island and 85% in Northwest Portugal), followed by DDTs, and lastly, HCB. Considerable differences in the organochlorine profile were identified between samples from Madeira and Northwest Portugal, with common dolphins showing higher PCB loads in Northwest Portugal (53 ± 37 μg g−1 lw) compared to Madeira Island (11 ± 4.8 μg g −1 lw). The high levels of PCBs found in individuals from mainland Portugal – reaching values up to 140 μg g−1 lw – are some of the highest reported for the species worldwide, considerably exceeding toxicity thresholds. This is of particular concern as they may be potentially affecting important physiological processes of the animals. These results highlight the poor habitat quality in one of the studied regions, with potential impacts on ecosystem health, while offering valuable insights into the population structure of a species that remains understudied for effective management and conservation. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), classified as a new species since 1998, is underexplored in ecotoxicology owing to ethical constraints and the lack of specific in vitro models. Herein, we established the first skin fibroblast cell line (TaSF) from an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin stranded along the Pearl River Estuary, China. TaSF cells exhibited strong proliferation in early passages but ceased mitosis at passage 19, likely owing to reaching the Hayflick limit. Morphology and immunofluorescence tests confirmed the fibroblastic nature of these cells. Karyotyping revealed 21 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XY), consistent with many cetaceans. To facilitate long-term future studies, TaSF cells were immortalized with exogenous simian virus 40 T antigen, creating the TaSFT cell line. The cytotoxic effects of 27 contaminants, including 6 organotins (OTs), 10 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and 11 phthalates (PAEs), on TaSFT cells were evaluated after 24-h exposure. Among these chemicals, OTs exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity, and both OTs and PFASs showed structure-related toxicity. These findings confirm the feasibility of TaSFT cells as a novel tool for ecotoxicity research on the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin and highlight the need for further investigation into the environmental contaminant pressures on this species. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is widely distributed worldwide and well adapted to various habitats. Animal genomes store clues about their pasts, and can reveal the genes underlying their evolutionary success. Here, we report the first high-quality chromosome-level genome of D. delphis. The assembled genome size was 2.56 Gb with a contig N50 of 63.85 Mb. Phylogenetically, D. delphis was close to Tursiops truncatus and T. aduncus. The genome of D. delphis exhibited 428 expanded and 1,885 contracted gene families, and 120 genes were identified as positively selected. The expansion of the HSP70 gene family suggested that D. delphis has a powerful system for buffering stress, which might be associated with its broad adaptability, longevity, and detoxification capacity. The expanded IFN-α and IFN-ω gene families, as well as the positively selected genes encoding tripartite motif-containing protein 25, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1, and p38 MAP kinase, were all involved in pathways for antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic mechanisms. The genome data also revealed dramatic fluctuations in the effective population size during the Pleistocene. Overall, the high-quality genome assembly and annotation represent significant molecular resources for ecological and evolutionary studies of Delphinus and help support their sustainable treatment and conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the performance of an adapted design of a 0.6 m impulse turbine in a new wave energy conversion device—the Dolphin device—is evaluated. This study is focused on developing an optimised structure in order to maximise the potential of the device and provide a lightweight and robust novel design. For this purpose, initial studies on the system involved 2D CFD simulations combined with parametric optimisation, which validated the use of the turbine system with water as the working fluid. The obtained component geometries were then used for the creation of a 3D CFD model, which was tested in a set-up dynamic simulation environment. Subsequently, the performance of the system was evaluated through the use of referenced experimental analyses. By taking into account the loading conditions present at the blades, as well as the inherent typical loads caused by the rotational speed of the turbine, the system was then optimised using generative design processes. Through the applied methodology, the performance of the turbine was predicted to be 61.79%. Moreover, the generative design optimisation showed a reduction in mass of 60.226% for the blade structure and 69.523% for the rotor structure. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans are regarded as a sentinel species because their health and population changes can serve as indicators of effects on marine ecosystems. We characterized levels of 24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 7 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in blubber, kidney, liver, and muscle of 138 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that stranded in the Mississippi Sound (MSS) between 2010 and 2021. The samples were divided into four time periods: 2010–2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, to assess whether there was a significant association between chemical levels in dolphin tissues and the 2019 unusual mortality event (UME) in the MSS resulting from the unprecedented freshwater incursion from 2 openings of the Bonnet Carré Spillway (BCS). We found 7 PCBs were readily detected in all tissues across time, and the major PAH was naphthalene, with detection of biphenyl and acenaphthene at lower levels and frequency. There was little change in tissue PCB levels over time; only naphthalene in the blubber was higher in tissues from dolphins that stranded before 2019. However, there were not significant changes in chemical levels in tissues from stranded bottlenose dolphins in the MSS before or after the UME in 2019. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Contaminant accumulation in organisms can be influenced by both biological traits and environmental conditions. However, delineating the main factors affecting contaminant burdens in organisms remains challenging. Here, we conducted an initial investigation into the impact of diet and habitat on the accumulation of short- (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (2003–2020, n = 128) from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), a highly polluted estuary in China. The detected levels of SCCPs (5897 ± 3480 ng g−1 lw) and MCCPs (13,960 ± 8285 ng g−1 lw) in blubber samples of humpback dolphin are the highest among recorded values marine mammals. Both SCCPs and MCCPs exhibited biomagnification factor values exceeding 1, suggesting their biomagnification potential within the dolphins and their diet. Quantitative diet analysis using the dolphin fatty acid signatures revealed that humpback dolphins inhabiting the western PRE consumed a larger proportion of carnivorous fish than those from the eastern PRE. However, spatial analysis showed that humpback dolphins in the western PRE contained lower SCCP/MCCP concentrations than those from the eastern PRE. Based on these findings we suggest that, compared to diet differences, spatial variations of SCCPs/MCCPs in humpback dolphins may be predominantly influenced by their space-use strategies, as the eastern PRE is closer to the pollutant discharge source and transfer routes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Dolphin communication involves acoustic signals, including whistles, and the well-studied bottlenose dolphins produce individually distinctive whistles called signature whistles (SWs). The production of a potential SW by an injured Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin has been reported, but no study has attempted to validate this finding in this species. Using data collected during encounters with free-ranging Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins at two locations in the northern South China Sea, we investigated the production of SWs by these dolphins. Of the 3846 analysed whistles, 37% were identified as potential SWs (PSWs) using the SIGnature whistle IDentification method and categorized into 82 PSW types. Overall, PSWs were identified during 54% of encounters. Given the high production rate of stereotyped whistles (62% of all whistles in 90% of encounters) compared with the identified PSWs, we suggest that the SIGnature whistle IDentification method criteria cannot be fully adapted for the detection of SWs in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, and more research should be conducted to adapt the criteria to the species. In addition, the characteristics of PSWs differed slightly between locations, potentially because of the geographical separation of populations and habitat differences (e.g. noise levels). The present results confirm the production of stereotyped whistles, including PSWs, by Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Further research should be conducted to confirm whether these whistles are similar to bottlenose dolphins’ SWs. © 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: It is well known that communication range, often termed active space,1 varies with habitat structure, and this variation can influence individual vocal behavior across taxa.23 While theoretical predictions imply that communication distances can drive the evolution of mammalian alliance sizes,4 empirical tests of this hypothesis are currently lacking. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, unrelated male bottlenose dolphins form multilevel alliances, where males work together in pairs or trios to herd single estrus females.5678 Here, we use empirical measures of male dolphin vocalizations, ambient noise levels, and high-resolution bathymetry data to estimate variation in active space across the study site. We combine this with long-term data on male alliance behavior to determine how active space influences alliance group size and mating success. We show that the active space of vocalizations used by allied males in a reproductive context predicts the number of preferred alliance partners with whom individuals cooperate over the longer term, ultimately contributing significantly to male access to mating opportunities. These results reveal that variation in sensory ecology driven by heterogeneous habitat influences optimal cooperative group size and mating success within a single population of wild animals. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The bionic robotic dolphin often employs a multi-joint dorsoventral mechanism to achieve dolphin-like undulatory propulsion, ensuring excellent maneuverability. However, the motors of the oscillating joints in this mechanism are susceptible to sticking faults, posing a challenge for the robotic dolphin to maintain its intended swimming depth, leading to undesired ascent or descent. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive fault-tolerant depth control method for a bionic robotic dolphin experiencing oscillating joint faults. First, the mechatronic design and dynamic model of a four-joint robotic dolphin are introduced. Thereafter, the swimming behaviors of the robotic dolphin with struck oscillating joints are analyzed. Based on this, an adaptive fault-tolerant depth controller is designed to minimize the reference tracking errors by updating dynamic model parameters in real time. Extension experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control method. The results demonstrate that this controller enables the robotic dolphin to successfully achieve and maintain the target depth, even in the presence of stuck oscillating joints. These findings confirm the robustness and practicality of the fault-tolerant depth control approach for the bionic robotic dolphins, thereby ensuring their safety in complex ocean conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Mercury contamination has been aggravated by emerging environmental issues, such as climate change. Top predators present concerning Hg concentrations once this metal bioaccumulates and biomagnifies. This study evaluated total mercury (THg) concentrations in tissues of 43 franciscanas (Pontoporia blainvillei) from two populations: the Franciscana Management Area (FMA) IIb and FMA IIIa. Animals from FMA IIIa showed mean concentration 5-times and 2.5-times higher in the liver and kidney (4.73 ± 6.84 and 0.52 ± 0.51 µg.g-1, w.w., respectively) than individuals from FMA IIb (0.89 ± 1.04 and 0.22 ± 0.15 µg.g-1, w.w., respectively). This might be due to: (I) individuals sampled from FMA IIIa being larger and older, and/or (II) the area near FMA IIIa presents environmental features leading to higher THg availability. Coastal contamination can affect franciscanas’ health and population maintenance at different levels depending on their life history and, therefore, it should be considered to guide specific conservation actions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: The analysis of gastrointestinal contents of dead animals is the primary and most traditional technique used to investigate cetacean feeding habits. The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) is among the most common cetacean species on the Brazilian coast. Sepetiba and Ilha Grande bays currently house this species’ highest population estimates. The present study aims to characterize the feeding habits of the Guiana dolphin between 2007 and 2021 by analyzing the stomach contents of individuals found dead in Sepetiba and Ilha Grande bays. Based on this analysis, we compared feeding habits according to gender, sexual maturity, seasonality, and location. We also investigated the feeding habits of this species during the morbillivirus event. The diet of the Guiana dolphins of Sepetiba and Ilha Grande bays was predominantly composed of teleost fish, with cephalopods being the second most consumed prey. The prey family most present in the diet of the Guiana dolphin in Sepetiba and Ilha Grande bays was the teleost fish Sciaenidae. Although these populations live in very close environments, they show distinct feeding habits. The conservation of these ecosystems is crucial for preserving Guiana dolphins and other species that use Sepetiba and Ilha Grande bays to live, reproduce, and feed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana dolphin is a small, vulnerable species often caught in artisanal gillnets. This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of their acoustic capabilities by using advanced equipment to collect a large dataset of wideband, continuous recordings. We examined the detailed acoustic signals of franciscana dolphins, comparing the sounds from rehabilitated dolphins in captivity with those of wild dolphins near fishing nets. Significant differences in acoustic characteristics were found between neonates and older dolphins, with juvenile and wild dolphins showing similar features. For the first time, repetition patterns in click production were identified, highlighting the importance of understanding the context of these sounds in regards to feeding and communication. This study emphasizes the need for detecting neonates for species protection and suggests the potential for developing acoustic classifiers specific to different age groups. Our findings offer valuable insights for conservation efforts and the development of protection strategies for franciscana dolphins. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a ubiquitous pollutant that elicits a wide range of toxic effects in exposed biota. Coastal zones in highly urbanized or industrial areas are particularly vulnerable to PFOS pollution. At present, information is lacking on biomarkers to assess PFOS effects on aquatic wildlife. This study investigated the efficacy of L-carnitine (or carnitine) and fatty acids as biomarkers of PFOS exposure in aquatic biota. The levels of PFOS, total and free carnitine, and 24 fatty acids (measured as fatty acid methyl esters or FAMEs) were measured in the liver, and muscle or blubber, of fish and dolphins sampled from Galveston Bay and the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). Overall, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) had the highest hepatic PFOS levels. Galveston Bay fish, gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), had hepatic PFOS levels ∼8-13× higher than nGoM pelagic fish species, red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). The multivariate analysis of PFOS liver body-burdens and biomarkers found carnitine to be a more modal biomarker of PFOS exposure than FAMEs. Significant positive correlation of hepatic PFOS levels with total carnitine was evident for biota from Galveston Bay (fish only), and a significant correlation between PFOS and total and free carnitine was evident for biota from the nGoM (fish and dolphins). Given the essential role of carnitine in mediating fatty acid β-oxidation, our results suggest carnitine to be a likely candidate biomarker of environmental PFOS exposure and indicative of potential dyslipidemia effects. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Natural whale falls and falls of smaller-sized food have been reported for more than 30 years and are known to be important sources of nutrients and organic matter for the seafloor community. However, the associated species composition and ecological processes during such events in the hadal zone were unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of depth and predation on the hadal community during the early stages of a food-fall event. This is the first study to investigate the preliminary stages of the two deepest artificial dolphin-fall events in the Philippine Basin (PB) (∼7729 m) and Mariana Trench (MT) (∼8200 m). A total of nine dives were conducted over a period of 86 days (PB) and 50 days (MT) using the deep-sea manned submersible “Fendouzhe.” Our observations in the PB indicated that the first stage (mobile-scavenger) was controlled by the feeding ecology of hadal amphipods and snailfish. In contrast, the absence of predatory snailfish in the MT enhanced the degradation rate of the carcass compared to that in the PB. Most soft tissues were entirely consumed by scavenging amphipods within days of the event in the MT, whereas in the PB, amphipods were observed taking a feeding hiatus on Day 10 to escape snailfish predation. The second stage (enrichment-opportunist), which hosted few grazing faunas, began at different times in each location and overlapped with the mobile-scavenger stage. Dolphin carcasses, being smaller than those of full-grown whales, can only sustain a large community of scavenging amphipods, and indirectly, predatory snailfish. After the first stage, the dispersed organic matter and limited lipid content in dolphin bones were likely insufficient to sustain an active grazing community or the chemosynthetic community that typically follows. We concluded that water depth influences the successional stages and decomposition rate of food falls in the hadal zone by controlling the dynamic relationship between prey and predators. Our study elucidates the ecology of food-fall events in the hadal zone and highlights the key differences in food-fall events at different depths. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic noise may significantly affect marine mammals' vocalizations. The aim of this work is to describe for the first time the acoustic features of the click trains, buzzes, burst pulses and whistles produced by the Risso's dolphins in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central Mediterranean), the concurrent levels of noise to which dolphins are exposed, and the potential reactive changes in the acoustic structure of the species vocalizations. About 6 h of recordings were collected from April 2019 to September 2022 during daytime boat surveys. Elevated ambient noise levels were mainly present at the frequencies lower than 63 Hz, at about 1 kHz and 50 kHz likely attributable to anthropogenic activity, such as shipping and sonars. Even if the acoustic features of all the vocalizations can be disrupted, especially with increasing noise below 1 kHz and between 20 and 63 kHz, the click trains were the most affected vocalizations, showing changes in their Inter-Click-Interval and in the Peak Amplitude. Since these vocalizations are used for navigation and searching for prey, their alteration raises concerns on the potential negative effects on the well-being of the Risso's dolphin population in the Gulf of Taranto. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Visual line-transect surveys are widely used to estimate the abundance of cetacean populations; however, this method can be prohibitively expensive. Thus, a less expensive alternative method was investigated in the present study, i.e., whether temporal changes in the bycatch per unit effort (BPUE) of cetaceans could be used to index the changes in their abundance. Specifically, the relationship between the annual BPUE of two main bycatch fisheries and the relative abundance of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) was examined in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 when vessel-based line-transect surveys were conducted in the coastal region of the East Sea of Korea. The encounter rate (individuals/km) by study year was significantly correlated with the annual BPUE of set nets. An increase in the density (individuals/km2) of common dolphins, estimated according to a hazard-rate key function by study year, was associated with an increase in the BPUE of set nets. These results suggest that the annual BPUE of common dolphins could be used to index the species' relative abundance. The BPUE of set nets, which are fixed in coastal regions, reflect the densities of common dolphins in the coastal regions better than that of gill nets used in coastal and offshore regions. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a fault-tolerant heading-control method for a bionic gliding robotic dolphin operating in the presence of flipper faults. To achieve both high manoeuvrability and long endurance, a bionic gliding robotic dolphin that integrates the propulsion modes of dolphins and underwater gliders is introduced. The operational conditions of the flippers are considered meticulously, and common fault types that can arise during the gliding process, such as stuck, failure, and efficiency-loss faults, are analysed. These faults can affect the heading capabilities of the gliding robotic dolphin. To ensure normal navigation in the presence of flipper faults, a fault-tolerant heading control method is devised for the gliding robotic dolphin. This method applies backstepping sliding control to establish control laws based on a dynamic model. Subsequently, a flipper angle solver is designed to convert the controller outputs into deflection angles for the flippers. Simulation results obtained under three typical flipper faults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control method. This fault-tolerant control method ensures the safety of gliding robotic dolphins under complex deep-sea conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Accurate description of population structure and genetic connectivity is essential for efficient conservation efforts. Along the European coastline, Tursiops truncatus typically shows high site fidelity to relatively small areas, often semi-enclosed waters, but patterns of genetic connectivity among such areas are often poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the patterns of genetic structure and connectivity of Tursiops truncatus in the Adriatic Sea and contiguous Mediterranean, using multilocus microsatellite genotypes. We focus particularly on areas where photo-ID studies suggest the occurrence of local ‘resident communities’. Patterns of geographic structure were identified using multivariate methods, Bayesian assignment methods, and analyses of relatedness. Our results are consistent with the occurrence of communities with high site fidelity to the Gulf of Ambracia, Croatian island archipelagos, and the Gulf of Trieste. Dolphins in these regions do not fit a model of complete panmixia, but neither do they exhibit multiple discrete population units. Even for the community in the Gulf of Ambracia, which is well separated by several population genetic estimates, we can unambiguously identify individual dispersal to the most distant area in the Northern Adriatic Sea. We suggest that the population structure patterns in these animals might be best described as a stable metapopulation and discuss the implications of such a model for regional conservation efforts. The critically endangered Ambracian sub-population is particularly well differentiated, and is therefore at high risk of local extinction due to relatively small size, high degree of isolation and exposure to several anthropogenic pressures. The exact geographic boundaries of individual sub-populations cannot always be determined due to lack of sampling and low resolution of the methods used. Nevertheless, our results have important implications for effective conservation of local communities showing strong site fidelity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals often aggregate and forage in specific ‘hotspot’ areas, which are associated with the predictability of prey sources driven by certain oceanographic processes. However, our understanding of the interactions between marine predators and the oceanographic processes remains incomplete, particularly in near-coastal and estuarine regions. This study investigated how predictable oceanographic processes influence the distribution patterns of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) foraging in a known hotspot within the Pearl River Estuary, characterized by the complex topography of its manmade harbor and the interplay between strong tidal flows and river plumes. To address the fine-scale spatial distribution pattern of dolphin foraging, we conducted fixed passive acoustic monitoring of foraging ‘buzzes’ both inside and outside the harbor. Additionally, boat-based transect surveys were conducted to explore the relationship between dolphin foraging and associated water properties and current fields driven by oceanographic processes. Temporal trend analyses of buzzes revealed a pronounced tidal-related pattern in dolphin foraging activity, with increased detections during ebbing tides outside the harbor. Transect surveys indicated areas with elevated chlorophyll and turbidity levels attracted more dolphins during flood tides, whereas regions with high surface salinity gradients were preferred by dolphins during ebb tides. Oceanographic analysis recognized these bio-physical links as indicators of oceanographic features, including chlorophyll-rich river plumes, converging fronts, and shear-induced turbulence. These features enhance prey abundance and availability for humpback dolphins. This study highlights that oceanographic processes are crucial for determining the fine-scale spatiotemporal distribution of foraging in coastal dolphins, and offers insights into the effective prediction of dolphin aggregation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Despite their high pathogenicity, limited knowledge is available on intrahost migration pathways and microhabitat distribution of pseudaliid lungworms. In this study, the distribution of Halocercus delphini in the lungs of the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, was analyzed on three scales: between the right and left lungs, within the lungs, and between worm clusters. Evidence of a relationship between the distribution of H. delphini and the perfusion of the lungs of S. coeruleoalba is provided by the consistent correlation of these two factors, both on a longitudinal scale and by the difference in parasite burden between the left and right lung. This relationship, when coupled with the nested pattern of colonization, suggests that this species, like many other metastrongyloids, migrates to the lungs via the circulatory system. Additionally, the concentration of lungworms around the major airways could be a further reflection of the well-perfused nature of these passageways. Equally, this distribution could be a strategy to minimize the distance that larvae must travel to exit the lungs via the trachea, as do most other metastrongyloids. On a more localized scale, the tendency of H. delphini to form distinct heterosexual clusters even at low infection intensities indicates active mate-seeking behavior for reproduction. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Maternal grouping dynamics involve trade-offs between: (1) infant protection from predation (predation hypothesis), (2) infant protection from male harassment (infant safety hypothesis), and (3) reducing scramble competition for prey resources (foraging-type scramble competition hypothesis). Using unmanned aerial vehicles, we assessed grouping dynamics in common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) groups containing mother-calf pairs to address these hypotheses. We analyzed social aspects and structural group elements using generalized additive mixed models and modeled group formation using multinomial generalized estimating equations. Calf proportion was higher in very compact groups and in groups of 10–20 individuals but decreased in larger groups. The frequency of socio-sexual behaviors increased in larger groups and decreased in groups with higher calf proportion. Calf distance to its nearest neighbor decreased with increasing group size and cohesion. With a higher proportion of calves, scatter (versus parallel) formation was less frequent. A calf's nearest neighbor was most often (55.4%) a nonmother. Calves showed a preference for being in the front center of the group. These results offer strong support for the predation and infant safety hypotheses and partial support for the foraging-type scramble competition hypothesis. This work provides insight into the adaptive function of maternal strategies in a small delphinid. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins, top predators of the aquatic food chain, are used as sentinel species of marine pollution as they are sensitive to environmental changes and able to accumulate a large content of contaminants. Several EU directives promote study of marine mammalians as bio-indicators to evaluate the presence of contaminants in the aquatic environment, such as the Mediterranean Sea, which is rich in environmental pollutants due to its geographic and geo-morphological characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the content of toxic and essential metals and metalloids (Hg, Pb, Cd, As, Se and Zn), through ICP-MS analysis, in organs/tissues (liver, muscle, lung, kidney and skin) of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) stranded along the Sicilian coastlines of the Mediterranean Sea. The results confirm the exposure of dolphins to toxic metals and metalloids, with the highest Hg levels observed in skin and liver, although a low Metal Pollution Index (MPI) was found in all samples of both dolphin species. From a comparative analysis of trace metals and metalloids according to sex and state of development, the highest levels of Cd and As were found in females vs. males and adults vs. juveniles, except for Pb in both species, and significant differences were observed between the two species, size of specimens, and organs/tissues analyzed. The highest Hg levels were correlated to those of essential metals Se and Zn, expressed as molar ratios, to evaluate the potential synergic effect of these detoxifying elements against Hg toxicity. This study confirms the rule of Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus delphis as valid sentinel species of the Mediterranean Sea, to verify the trend of metals pollution in this aquatic environment and, consequently, the health of these marine species. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) inhabit bays, sounds, and estuaries (BSEs) throughout the southeast region of the U.S.A. and are sentinel species for human and ecosystem-level health. Dolphins are vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of contaminants through the coastal food chain because they are high-level predators. Currently, there is limited information on the spatial dynamics of mercury accumulation in these dolphins. Total mercury (THg) was measured in dolphin skin from multiple populations across the U.S. Southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, and the influence of geographic origin, sex, and age class was investigated. Mercury varied significantly among sampling sites and was greatest in dolphins in St. Joseph Bay, Florida Everglades, and Choctawhatchee Bay (14,193 ng/g ± 2196 ng/g, 10,916 ng/g ± 1532 ng/g, and 7333 ng/g ± 1405 ng/g wet mass (wm), respectively) and lowest in dolphins in Charleston and Skidaway River Estuary (509 ng/g ± 32.1 ng/g and 530 ng/g ± 58.4 ng/g wm, respectively). Spatial mercury patterns were consistent regardless of sex or age class. Bottlenose dolphin mercury exposure can effectively represent regional trends and reflect large-scale atmospheric mercury input and local biogeochemical processes. As a sentinel species, the bottlenose dolphin data presented here can direct future studies to evaluate mercury exposure to human residents in St. Joseph Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, and Florida Coastal Everglades, as well as additional sites with similar geographical, oceanographic, or anthropogenic parameters. These data may also inform state and federal authorities that establish fish consumption advisories to determine if residents in these locales are at heightened risk for mercury toxicity. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Alabama (AL) is a hotspot in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) for human interaction–related cetacean strandings, including harassment, vessel strikes, and fisheries interactions. We examined four bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) stranded dead along the AL coast during 2012–2017 with severed peduncles suspected to be related to human interaction (HI). Evidence from each case, including photographs, gross necropsy results, and histopathologic findings when available, was reviewed to determine the mode of severance and whether it contributed to death. In each case, the severance site had smooth, clean edges on at least one side, indicating the use of a sharp instrument to remove the caudal peduncle and flukes. Three cases also had evidence of fisheries interactions, including linear impressions around the rostrum, fins and/or flukes, indicating that these animals may have been entangled in fisheries gear prior to death. Histopathology in one of these cases revealed that the severance occurred perimortem; speculatively, the caudal peduncle and flukes may have been cut off to facilitate removing the dolphin from its entanglement. Although cases of amputation and mutilation are not uncommon globally among stranding reports, few cases have been described and analyzed in the literature. This paper is the first to document and compare multiple cases of severed peduncles with evidence of HI, including fisheries, in the GoM. This case series enhances our understanding of the types of HI occurring in bottlenose dolphins and highlights the need for continued public education, policy, and management to address cases like these.

ABSTRACT: Epigenetic age estimation has the potential to influence conservation approaches for wildlife. DNA extracted from a small skin sample can be analyzed for methylation changes, which can be related to chronological age through an epigenetic clock to obtain a DNA-based age estimate (DNAm age). For a wide range of cetacean species, skin samples can be obtained remotely using dart biopsy. We tested multiple modeling approaches (elastic net regression, random forest regression, and a hybrid of elastic net and random forest classification) using DNA methylation data from 426 skin samples from observed-age wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), and 50 managed care dolphins, to develop an epigenetic clock. The hybrid model gave highly accurate age predictions for calf (<2 yrs., n = 28), subadult (2–15 yrs., n = 273) and adult (15–25 yrs., n = 110) age classes with median absolute errors (MAE) of 0.149, 1.46 and 3.25 yrs., respectively. In the oldest individuals (>25 yrs., n = 65), age predictions were less accurate, with MAE of 5.90 yrs. The overall MAE across all ages (n = 476) was 1.91 yrs. DNAm age has been linked to health in humans, with higher age residuals (i.e., higher DNAm age as compared to actual age) being associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. We compared dolphin age residuals with previously reported health scores that are predictive of one year mortality risk. Our findings suggest that analysis of DNA methylation patterns is a viable approach, not only for estimating age of dolphins, but potentially also to assess individual and population health. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The detrimental effects of bisphenol (BP) exposure are a concern for vulnerable species, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis). To investigate the characteristics of BP profiles and their adverse impact on humpback dolphins, we assessed the concentrations of six BPs, including bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol B (BPB), and bisphenol P (BPP) in blubber (n = 26) and kidney (n = 12) of humpback dolphins stranded in the Pearl River Estuary, China. BPS accounted for the largest proportion of the total bisphenols (∑BPs) in blubber (55%) and kidney (69%). The concentration of ∑BP in blubber was significantly higher than that in the kidney and liver. The EC50 values of five BPA alternatives were lower than those of BPA in humpback dolphin skin fibroblasts (ScSF) and human skin fibroblasts (HSF). ScSF was more sensitive to BPS, BPAF, BPB, and BPP than HSF. The enrichment pathway of BPA was found to be associated with inflammation and immune dysregulation, while BPP and BPS demonstrated a preference for genotoxicity. BPA, BPP, and BPS, which had risk quotients (RQs) > 1, were found to contribute to subhealth and chronic disease in humpback dolphins. According to the EC50-based risk assessment, BPS poses a higher health risk than BPA for humpback dolphins. This study successfully evaluated the risks of bisphenols in rare and endangered cetacean cell lines using a noninvasive method. More in vivo and in field observations are necessary to know whether the BPA alternatives are likely to be regrettable substitutions. © 2023 American Chemical Society

ABSTRACT: Animal welfare assessments have recently been suggested to be useful for free-ranging animals. Nevertheless, few standardized welfare assessment frameworks have been built for wildlife, including cetaceans. Coastal cetaceans like Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis, IPHDs) that form resident populations impacted by a wide range of human activities are subject to reliable photo-identification efforts and thus represent perfect candidates for welfare monitoring. Parameters that may inform us on some aspects of the welfare of free-ranging IPHDs were selected through literature review. A panel survey including three consecutive rounds was then conducted to collect the opinion of selected experts on these parameters. The survey allowed the validation of a list containing 31 parameters that provide information on the welfare of IPHDs. The opinion of experts also allowed to set the modalities of the data collection required to measure/observe these parameters. After establishing a consistent scoring method and testing it on existing data, this standardized framework will allow for obtaining a wide picture of the living conditions of IPHDs. Variations across time periods, among dolphin populations and locations, or following major environmental changes (e.g., conservation measures or human disturbances) could then be analysed. Added to traditional conservation approaches, standardized welfare monitoring will greatly participate in the conservation of these animals. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: As long-lived apex predators, marine mammal adults often accumulate alarmingly levels of environmental contaminants. Nevertheless, the accumulation and risks of these contaminants in the critical calf stage of marine mammals remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the exposure status and health risks of 74 organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin calves (Sousa chinensis) collected from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China, during 2005–2019. Our findings revealed moderate levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), medium-high levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), and the highest levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs) compared to those reported for cetaceans elsewhere. Traditional OHCs like DDTs, PCBs, and PBDEs did not exhibit significant decreasing trends in the dolphin calves despite global restrictions on these compounds, and AHFRs as emerging OHCs showed an increasing trend over the study period. Risk quotients of DDTs, HCHs, PBDEs, and PCBs in most of the dolphin samples were > 1, indicating that humpback dolphin calves may have suffered long-term threats from OHC exposure. The significant correlation observed between the traditional OHC levels and the stranding death number of the dolphin calves suggests these OHCs may impact the survival of this endangered species. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds ubiquitous in the environment and known for their toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects. These compounds can bioaccumulate in the biota and be transferred through trophic webs. The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), as top predators, can be an environmental sentinels. Thus, this study aimed to provide data about PAHs concentration in their hepatic tissue collected on the coast of Espírito Santo (Franciscana Management Area, FMA Ia), Rio de Janeiro (FMA IIa), and São Paulo states (FMA IIb), in Southeastern Brazil. PAHs were detected in 86 % of franciscana dolphins (n = 50). The highest ∑PAHsTotal median concentration was reported in FMA Ia followed by FMA IIb and FMA IIa (1055.6; 523.9, and 72.1 ng.g-1 lipid weight, respectively). Phenanthrene was detected in one fetus and two neonates, showing maternal transfer of PAHs in these dolphins. Evaluating PAHs with potential toxic effects is of utmost importance for the conservation of a threatened species. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (IPHDs) who form resident populations along the Chinese coastline are facing a wide range of anthropogenic disturbances including intense fishing and some populations have been shown to experience a severe decline. Body condition is thought to be a good indicator of health since it is linked to survival and reproductive success. In order to better understand population trends, we investigated whether the body condition of IPHDs is poorer in populations whose status is alarming than in other populations. UAV flights were conducted from 2022 to 2023 in four locations (i.e., Sanniang Bay, Leizhou Bay, Jiangmen, and Lingding Bay) in the northern South China Sea. Body ratios were calculated using the body length and widths of IPHDs and were used to analyze differences among seasons, locations, and demographic parameters. A PCA was then used to obtain a detailed picture of the body condition composition of dolphins at each location. Results showed that dolphins from Leizhou Bay and Jiangmen were in better body condition than those from Sanniang Bay and Lingding Bay. Since populations inhabiting Sanniang Bay and Lingding Bay have been shown to experience a sharp decline, it can be hypothesized that poor body condition may have played a role in such a trend. Further investigations of the factors impacting IPHDs' body condition are needed, including monitoring of prey density, contaminant concentration, stress levels, and impacts of human activities on dolphins' behavior. In addition, the creation of a robust scoring method would allow for regular monitoring of IPHDs' body condition to inform conservation measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The assessment of chemical pollution in free-ranging living mammals is viable using remote biopsies and portrays a comprehensive scenario of environmental health. The Southwestern Atlantic Ocean holds incredible biodiversity, but it is under the constant and invisible threat of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of anthropogenic origin, such as pesticides, brominated flame retardants, and industrial-use compounds (e.g., PCBs). Thus, this study aimed to assess the bioaccumulation of POPs (PCBs, DDTs, HCB, mirex and PBDEs) and natural organobromine compounds (MeO-BDEs) using gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in biopsy samples of Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis, n = 20) that inhabit and forage both inside and in adjacent areas to degraded (Guanabara Bay) and conserved (Ilha Grande Bay) coastal bays in the Southeastern Brazil. Among the studied compounds, PCBs were predominant in the contamination profile with median concentration of 97.0 μg.g-1 lipid weight (lw), followed by the sum of the p,p’ isomers of DDT, DDD, and DDE of 11.0 μg.g-1 lw, the brominated flame retardants PBDEs of 1.6 μg.g-1 lw, and the other organochlorine pesticides mirex of 0.78 μg.g-1 lw, and HCB of 0.049 μg.g-1 lw. The MeO-BDEs were detected with a median concentration of 22.8 μg.g-1 lw. 85 % of the Atlantic spotted dolphins analyzed in this study presented PCB concentration that exceeded even the less conservative threshold limits for adverse health effects (41 μg.g-1 lw). This study shows that despite the conservation status of preserved bays, cetacean species foraging in these locations are still under increased threat. Hence chemical pollution demands local and global efforts to be mitigated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Pontoporia blainvillei, commonly known as the Franciscana dolphin, inhabits the coastal waters of South America and is classified as vulnerable and as undergoing significant population declines. This species is generally found in turbid coastal waters, although it is also found in clear waters, as well as marine areas associated with islands and rocky shores. Tumours originating from cholangiocytes have been rarely described in cetaceans, with descriptions limited to cholangiocellular carcinomas. Cholangiocellular adenomas are characterised by the formation of bile ducts and are rarer than cholangiocellular carcinoma. This study described the first report of a tumour originating from cholangiocytes in P. blainvillei, raising concerns on this endangered cetacean's health status and conservation. The underlying causes of this tumour in Franciscana dolphins remain unknown, highlighting the need for further research. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The Adriatic Sea is one of the Mediterranean areas most exposed to cumulative human stressors. This semi-enclosed and largely shallow basin has been subjected to intensive exploitation and destructive fishing practices for decades, resulting in biodiversity decline and poor ecosystem health. Diversity of cetaceans is lower than in other parts of the Mediterranean, and the extant dolphins and whales have been facing threats that include the combined effects of habitat loss and degradation, prey depletion, incidental mortality and injury caused by fisheries, anthropogenic noise, chemical contamination and climate change. Here, we report information for the nine cetacean species known to occur in the basin (classified as either regular, visitor or vagrant), plus three species characterized by a single record. For these species, we review evidence from field research and other studies – with a bias towards the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus (by far the most intensively-studied cetacean in this area). We also describe and characterize the main threats to cetaceans in the Adriatic, relying on recent literature as well as historical information that helps frame the present status of cetaceans in the context of past human impacts (particularly the extensive killing campaigns conducted until the 1960s). Finally, we provide management recommendations to inform and guide the action that must be taken in compliance with extant legislation, marine conservation directives and international commitments to protect marine biodiversity. © 2024, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

ABSTRACT: There is growing concern about the potential adverse health effects of phthalates (PAEs) on human health and the environment due to their extensive use as plasticizers and additives in commercial and consumer products. In this study, we assessed PAE concentrations in serum samples from aquarium-based delphinids (Tursiops truncatus, n = 36; Orcinus orca, n = 42) from California, Florida, and Texas, USA. To better understand the physiological effects of phthalates on delphinids, we also explored potential correlations between phthalates and the biomarkers aldosterone, cortisol, corticosterone, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde while accounting for sex, age, and reproductive stage. All PAEs were detected in at least one of the individuals. ΣPAE ranges were 5.995–2743 ng·mL−1 in bottlenose dolphins and 5.372–88,675 ng·mL−1 in killer whales. Both species displayed higher mean concentrations of DEP and DEHP. PAEs were detected in newborn delphinids, indicating transference via placenta and/or lactation. Linear mixed model results indicated significant correlations between aldosterone, month, location, status, and ΣPAEs in killer whales, suggesting that aldosterone concentrations are likely affected by the cumulative effects of these variables. This study expands on the knowledge of delphinid physiological responses to PAEs and may influence management and conservation decisions on contamination discharge regulations near these species. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are keystone and sentinel species in the world’s oceans. We studied correlations between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their stress axis. We investigated associations between plasma biomarkers of 12 different PFAS variants and three cortisol pools (total, bound, and free) in wild T. truncatus from estuarine waters of Charleston, South Carolina (n = 115) and Indian River Lagoon, Florida (n = 178) from 2003 to 2006, 2010-2013, and 2015. All PFAS and total cortisol levels for these dolphins were previously reported; bound cortisol levels and free cortisol calculations have not been previously reported. We tested null hypotheses that levels of each PFAS were not correlated with those of each cortisol pool. Free cortisol levels were lower when PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS biomarker levels were higher, but free cortisol levels were higher when PFTriA was higher. Bound cortisol levels were higher when there were higher PFDA, PFDoDA, PFDS, PFTeA, and PFUnDA biomarkers. Total cortisol was higher when PFOA was lower, but total cortisol was higher when PFDA, PFDoDA, PFTeA, and PFTriA were higher. Additional analyses indicated sex and age trends, as well as heterogeneity of effects from the covariates carbon chain length and PFAS class. Although this is a cross-sectional observational study and, therefore, could reflect cortisol impacts on PFAS toxicokinetics, these correlations are suggestive that PFAS impacts the stress axis in T. truncatus. However, if PFAS do impact the stress axis of dolphins, it is specific to the chemical structure, and could affect the individual pools of cortisol differently. It is critical to conduct long-term studies on these dolphins and to compare them to populations that have no or little expose to PFAS. © 2024 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Active acoustic emission from a mother to a calf after parturition is one strategy used to enhance recognition of mothers by calves and develop, then maintain, a mother–calf bond from an early stage. This study predicted that a high-calling postpartum period exists in a social delphinid, the Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). This species produces pulsed call sequences for vocal exchange with conspecifics, and these sequences appear to be an important signal between mothers and calves. Sounds were recorded from three pregnant females at the Niigata City Aquarium, Marinepia Nihonkai, Japan, before and after each birth in 2019, 2020, and 2021 to investigate the rate of their pulsed call sequences. Continuous data from prior to four days to five days following parturition, opportunistic data within the last pre-parturition month, and data from the postpartum period were obtained from the females. The pulsed call sequence gradually increased during the last gestational month. A high-rate sequence was repeated daily for four days pre-parturition and faded within several hours postpartum, and few sequences were produced from the day after parturition. Contrary to our prediction, the many pre-parturition sequences and fewer postpartum sequences suggest a low efficiency of postpartum imprinting in this species. © The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are long-lived marine mammals, upper-level predators, and they inhabit near-shore environments, which increases their exposure to pollution. Mercury is a ubiquitous and persistent metal pollutant that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify up the food chain. Dolphins are known to accumulate mercury, and limited research has shown that mercury exposure can weaken the immune system of dolphins. The objectives of this study were to assess the mercury concentrations in the tissues (muscle, small intestine, liver) of stranded bottlenose dolphins and to compare the tissue mercury levels in dolphins that were stranded during the 2013–2015 morbillivirus Unusual Mortality Event (UME; immunosuppressed individuals) with the levels of those that were stranded at a normal rate (2016–2021). Selenium has been shown to reduce mercury toxicity in many animals; therefore, tissue selenium concentration and the molar ratio of selenium to mercury were also assessed. The tissue mercury (muscle, liver) and selenium (liver) concentrations increased with the age of the dolphins, with the liver accumulating the highest concentrations. No sex differences were observed in the mercury and selenium concentrations. While differences in tissue mercury concentrations were not observed due to the UME, the selenium accumulation profiles were significantly different between the two time periods. These results suggest that selenium may not have been as protective against mercury toxicity in the bottlenose dolphins that were stranded during the UME, possibly due to infection with morbillivirus. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans play a pivotal role in maintaining the ecological equilibrium of ocean ecosystems. However, their populations are under global threat from environmental contaminants. Various high levels of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been detected in cetaceans from the South China Sea, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), suggesting potential health risks, while the impacts of endocrine disruptors on the dolphin population remain unclear. This study aims to synthesize the population dynamics of the humpback dolphins in the PRE and their profiles of EDC contaminants from 2005 to 2019, investigating the potential role of EDCs in the population dynamics of humpback dolphins. Our comprehensive analysis indicates a sustained decline in the PRE humpback dolphin population, posing a significant risk of extinction. Variations in sex hormones induced by EDC exposure could potentially impact birth rates, further contributing to the population decline. Anthropogenic activities consistently emerge as the most significant stressor, ranking highest in importance. Conventional EDCs demonstrate more pronounced impacts on the population compared to emerging compounds. Among the conventional pollutants, DDTs take precedence, followed by zinc and chromium. The most impactful emerging EDCs are identified as alkylphenols. Notably, as the profile of EDCs changes, the significance of conventional pollutants may give way to emerging EDCs, presenting a continued challenge to the viability of the humpback dolphin population. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we examined the usefulness of a simpler and more feasible method for determining the optimal timing of artificial insemination and the conditions for its success in six female common bottlenose dolphins. Pregnancy was successfully achieved in five dolphins by performing intrauterine insemination, using chilled semen stored for less than 3 days or frozen semen within 24 hr of exhibiting a peak serum estradiol (E2) level of 100 pg/mL or higher or on the day with a serum E2 level of approximately 100 pg/mL, measured with a simple measuring device. We concluded that the determining the optimal timing of intrauterine insemination by measuring serum E2 levels is a simpler and more useful method compared with the conventional approach.

ABSTRACT: Necropsy on a striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen, 1833) entangled in ghost fishing net and dead while rescuing yielded some helminth parasites, later identified as Halocercus lagenorhynchi. DNA barcoding of the host and parasite and the phylogenetic analysis of the parasite was conducted. This study provides valuable information towards establishing basal data of marine mammal parasite diversity and distribution in the Indian waters. We believe this is the first report of the occurrence of Halocercus lagenorhynchi in marine mammals in India. © Indian Society for Parasitology 2024.

ABSTRACT: There are extensive immunological reagents available for laboratory rodents and humans. However, for veterinary species there is a need for expansion of immunological toolkits, with this especially evident for marine mammals, such as cetaceans. In addition to their use in a research setting, immune assays could be employed to monitor the health status of cetaceans and serve as an adjunct to available diagnostic tests. Such development of specific and sensitive immune assays will enhance the proper care and stewardship of wild and managed cetacean populations. Our goal is to provide immune reagents and immune assays for the research community, clinicians, and others involved in care of bottlenose dolphins. This review will provide an update on our development of a bottlenose dolphin immunological toolkit. The future availability and continued development of these reagents is critical for improving wild and managed bottlenose dolphin population health through enhanced assessment of their responses to alterations in the marine environment, including pathogens, and improve our ability to monitor their status following vaccination. © 2024

ABSTRACT: In recent decades, worldwide cetacean species have been protected, but they are still threatened. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a vulnerable keystone species and a useful bioindicator of the health and balance of marine ecosystems in oceans all over the world. The genetic structure of the species is shaped by their niche specialization (along with other factors), leading to the classification of two ecotypes: coastal and pelagic. In this study, the genetic diversity, population structure, and ecotypes of bottlenose dolphins from the Canary Islands were assessed through the analysis of 49 new samples from biopsies and from stranded animals using the 636 bp portion of the mitochondrial control region and 343 individuals from databases (n = 392). The results reveal high genetic diversity in Canarian bottlenose dolphins (Hd = 0.969 and π = 0.0165) and the apparent lack of population genetic structure within this archipelago. High genetic structure (Fst, Φst) was found between the Canary Islands and coastal populations, while little to no structure was found with the pelagic populations. These results suggest that Canarian bottlenose dolphins are part of pelagic ecotype populations in the North Atlantic. The studied Special Areas of Conservation in the Canary Islands may correspond to a hotspot of genetic diversity of the species and could be a strategic area for the conservation of the oceanic ecotype of bottlenose dolphins. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: There is a growing concern about the presence of pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment, while the marine environment has been much less investigated than in freshwater. Marine mammals are suitable sentinel species of the marine environment because they often feed at high trophic levels, have unique fat stores and long lifespan. Some small delphinids in particular serve as excellent sentinel species for contamination in the marine environment worldwide. To the best of our knowledge, no pharmaceuticals have been detected or reported in dolphins so far. In the present study, muscle, liver and blubber samples from three common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and seven striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded along the Basque Coast (northern Spain) were collected. A total of 95 pharmaceuticals based on detectability and predicted ability to bioaccumulate in fish were included in the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. At least one pharmaceutical was found in 70 % of the individuals. Only three of the 95 monitored pharmaceuticals were detected in dolphin's tissues. Very low concentrations (<1 ng/g) of orphenadrine and pizotifen were found in liver and promethazine in blubber. Herein, the gap in the knowledge regarding the study organisms and marine environments with respect to pharmaceutical pollution, which demands further research to understand if pharmaceuticals are a threat for these apex predators, is highlighted and discussed. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The Ganga River hosts a metapopulation of endangered aquatic species. This study uses a hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS) to assess the habitat suitability of the Ganga River dolphins (GRDs) in a small reach (7.5 km) of the Ganga River at the upstream of Narora barrage in varying flow. We use Lidar points clouds to generate topography, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), and differential GPS (DGPS) to measure channel bathymetry and streamwise water surface slope. Further, the water level data from satellite altimeter is used to calibrate the model and discharge measured in field to validate the model output. We found that in the high flow period, the required flow depth for dolphin habitat is available throughout in the study reach. However, in the lean flow, the required flow depth and velocity are available only in some patches. The methodology developed here would be very useful in monitoring hydraulic habitat suitability of aquatic species in ungauged rivers. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The pink river dolphin, or bufeo, is one of the dolphins which lives in the rivers of the Orinoco and Amazon basins in South America. The Bolivian bufeo population is considered a differentiated species (Inia boliviensis) from the Amazon and Orinoco species (Inia geoffrensis). Until now, no study has completed an extensive population genetics analysis of the bufeo in Bolivian rivers. We analyzed 82 bufeos from different rivers from the Mamoré and Iténez (Guaporé) river basins for the mt control region (CR), nuclear microsatellites, and DQB-1 gene sequences to determine if the inner rapids of these Bolivian river basins have some influence on the genetic structure of this species. The first relevant result was that the genetic diversity for CR, and the microsatellites were substantially lower in the Bolivian bufeos than in the dolphins studied in other areas of the Amazon and Orinoco. However, the DQB-1 gene sequences yielded similar genetic diversity to those found in other areas. The second relevant result is the existence of some significant genetic heterogeneity among the bufeo populations within Bolivia, although in a small degree, but this differentiation is independent of the inner rapids of the Bolivian rivers we sampled. The third relevant result was the existence of significant isolation by distance for the CR, but not for microsatellites and DQB-1 gene sequences. This was related to differential gene flow capacity of females (philopatric) and males (less philopatric and more migrants) and, possibly, to different selective patterns affecting the molecular markers studied. The fourth relevant result was related to diverse demographic changes of these bufeos. At least two or three bottleneck events and one or two population expansions have occurred in the Bolivian bufeo population. The major part of these events occurred during the Pleistocene. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In coastal delphinid conservation, dolphin watching (DW) is frequently proposed for artisanal fishers as a community-based marine ecotourism (CBME) plan to reduce fishing effort and delphinid bycatch. Questions including whether DW profitability is sufficient to replace fishing and whether fishers can conduct DW sustainably, however, are rarely examined. In the present study, questionnaire targeting tourists was implemented to investigate DW profitability in Sanniang Bay, China where DW-based CBME has been operated by local fishers since 2004. CBME sustainability was evaluated by comparing DW profitability with household income with reference to local poverty, and rural and economically comfortable families in China. Out of 1046 tourists interviewed, 40 (3.82%) tourists knew there is DW in Sanniang Bay, while 292 (27.9%) tourists were lured to attend DW with low pricing. The fisher earned 110RMB (ca. 16.0$USD) per DW trip and required two, four, and nine trips per day to earn household income higher than poverty, rural and economically comfortable lines. Raising ticket fee and maximizing per-trip number of tourists can substantially improve DW profitability, which facilitates CBME sustainability and poses minimal impacts on target animals. CBME in rural areas could be trapped into low popularity–low pricing–low profitability embarrassments because of primitive tour facilities, insufficient ecological education value, poor hospitality skills and lacking marketing access. The sustainable CBME should incorporate ecologically friendly conducts, direct indigenous profits with minimal transaction costs, venture and service diversification, and marketing with indigenous cultural characteristics. DW history in Sanniang Bay further indicates profit distribution of tourism ventures directly influence CBME sustainability. Accordingly, indigenous rights, economic equity and social justice should be centrally placed in CBME policying with the minimal intervention from non-indigenous capitals and commercialized manipulations. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations were investigated in hepatic tissue of four dolphin species stranded along the south-east coast of Australia between 2006 and 2021; Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis), common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), and short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). Two Burrunan dolphin populations represented in the dataset have the highest reported global population concentrations of ∑25PFAS (Port Phillip Bay median 9750 ng/g ww, n = 3, and Gippsland Lakes median 3560 ng/g ww, n = 8), which were 50–100 times higher than the other species reported here; common bottlenose dolphin (50 ng/g ww, n = 9), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (80 ng/g ww, n = 1), and short-beaked common dolphin (61 ng/g ww, n = 12). Also included in the results is the highest reported individual ∑25PFAS (19,500 ng/g ww) and PFOS (18,700 ng/g ww) concentrations, at almost 30 % higher than any other Cetacea reported globally. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was above method reporting limits for all samples (range; 5.3–18,700 ng/g ww), and constituted the highest contribution to overall ∑PFAS burdens with between 47 % and 99 % of the profile across the dataset. The concentrations of PFOS exceed published tentative critical concentrations (677–775 ng/g) in 42 % of all dolphins and 90 % of the critically endangered Burrunan dolphin. This research reports for the first time novel and emerging PFASs such as 6:2 Cl-PFESA, PFMPA, PFEECH and FBSA in marine mammals of the southern hemisphere, with high detection rates across the dataset. It is the first study to show the occurrence of PFAS in the tissues of multiple species of Cetacea from the Australasian region, demonstrating high global concentrations for inshore dolphins. Finally, it provides key baseline knowledge to the potential exposure and bioaccumulation of PFAS compounds within the coastal environment of south-east Australia. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops) populations, also described as the Burrunan dolphins, consist of a resident population of approximately 150 individuals in Port Phillip Bay (PPB), Victoria. Previous reports indicate distribution across a small southern region of PPB; however, little is known about their full distribution patterns across the entire PPB region. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the Burrunan dolphins across four zones representative of PPB benthic habitats and bathymetry to gain a better understanding of the potential drivers of the population's habitat use. Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. One hundred and twenty-nine boat-based surveys were undertaken between March 2015 and August 2021, encompassing 181 sightings. Generalised linear models (GLMs) were used to investigate annual, seasonal and zonal variation. We found no variation in sighting frequencies between years. Austral summer and winter had a significantly higher sighting frequency than autumn. We found that Burrunan dolphins utilise the entire bay, further extending the species range, and show a significantly higher number of sightings in the southern zone than in any other zones. Overlaying dolphin sightings with known oceanographic characteristics within PPB, we found bathymetry and benthic habitats were potential drivers for the Burrunan dolphins distribution and habitat use within the bay, with the dolphins significantly favouring the 5–10 and 10–15 m contour depths. These results show a more widespread distribution across the bay than previously documented. We recommend expansion of the current marine protected areas in the north and south of the bay. This study has increased our understanding of the vital habitat for the Burrunan dolphin populations.

ABSTRACT: A comprehensive risk assessment to evaluate the vulnerability of the nearshore cetaceans to increasing marine traffic is lacking. In this study, the risk to Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in the main habitats in China was assessed based on a semiquantitative spatial vulnerability analysis. 85% of the (sub)population which overlapped with the lanes of ferries and/or cargo vessels, with exposure scores of 1.23 ± 0.31 (calculated based on the proportion of sea routes that overlap the dolphin’s range). A combination of high exposure to the sea routes and sensitivity to marine traffic would render the (sub)populations to be highly vulnerable (EPRE: 5.21 and XM: 4.47). A low frequency of vessels and an awareness of the ecology assures a low vulnerability (SH: 2.43, EZ: 2.73). Uncertainty scores were commonly lower for the higher vulnerable populations, and higher for the lower vulnerable populations, suggesting additional field data and more monitoring are necessary. Six years of field data have been used to analyze the influences of various types of marine traffic on humpback dolphin behavior. Fishing and non-fishing vessels were significantly different (χ2 = 65.19, p < 0.01). The humpback dolphins were attracted by fishing vessels (83.1%) but avoided non-fishing vessels (95.2%). We recommend a management with seasonal and geographical constraints, to balance economic development and environmental conservation. © Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2024.

ABSTRACT: A review of the prey of three amphiatlantic dolphin species, Tursiops truncatus, Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus delphis, is carried out. The main objective of this work is to review the feeding of these species in the Atlantic in order to assess the degrees of trophic competition and speciation pressure. A total of 103 fish families, 22 cephalopod families and 19 crustacean families have been counted, from which the species identified to the genus level only included seventy-one fish, twenty cephalopods and five crustaceans, and the total species identified included three-hundred-one fish, fifty cephalopods and twenty-six crustaceans. The most consumed prey were fish, followed by cephalopods and crustaceans. The exclusive prey consumed by each of the three dolphin species, as well as those shared by all or at least two of them, have also been counted. T. truncatus is the most general; however, the western Atlantic populations exhibit high dietary specialization compared to the eastern Atlantic populations, reflecting strong speciation pressure on both sides of the Atlantic. D. delphis and S. coeruleoalba, despite their amphiatlantism, have hardly been studied in the western Atlantic, except for a few references in the southern hemisphere, so the fundamental differences between the two species and their comparison with T. truncatus have been established with records from the eastern Atlantic. All three dolphin species have been observed to be expanding, especially D. delphis. This northward expansion and that of their prey is discussed. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Finding solutions for a sustainable coexistence between wildlife and humans is considered among the most challenging environmental management issues for scientists, conservationists, managers, and stockholders world-wide. Depredation by the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) on small scale fisheries has increased in the recent years, leading to a growing conflict in many areas of the Mediterranean Sea and pressing for urgent management solutions. This study aims at developing a management framework for a sustainable coexistence between fishers and dolphins in Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea). Relying on the combination of different approaches (field study, literature review and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis), the scientific evidence necessary for understanding dolphin depredation were updated and improved, the related economic damage was calculated, and different management options were identified and evaluated by several stakeholder groups to support the decision-making process. Averaging for all investigated net types (gillnet and trammel net), a depredation frequency of 53% was found, the highest values ever found in both Sardinia and many other Mediterranean sites. Depredation probability was influenced by different factors, such as net type, fishing operation duration, depth of the fishing site and period. The estimated economic damage due to depredation ranges on average between 6492 and 11,925 euro per year and depends on the type of fishing net. The results from the field study, the literature review and the stakeholder involvement allowed us to define the most plausible and shared management options, identifying a framework for assessing and managing the conflict between fishers and dolphins for the creation of a more sustainable vision for the future. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Species distribution modeling helps understand how environmental factors influence species distribution, creating profiles to predict presence in unexplored areas and assess ecological impacts. This study examined the habitat use and population ecology of the Chilean dolphin in Seno Skyring, Chilean Patagonia. We used three models—random forest (RF), generalized linear model (GLM), and artificial neural network (ANN)—to predict dolphin distribution based on environmental and biotic data like water temperature, salinity, and fish farm density. Our research has determined that the RF model is the most precise tool for predicting the habitat preferences of Chilean dolphins. The results indicate that these dolphins are primarily located within six kilometers of the coast, strongly correlating with areas featuring numerous fish farms, sheltered waters close to the shore with river inputs, and shallow productive zones. This suggests a potential association between dolphin presence and fish-farming activities. These findings can guide targeted conservation measures, such as regulating fish-farming practices and protecting vital coastal areas to improve the survival prospects of the Chilean dolphin. Given the extensive fish-farming industry in Chile, this research highlights the need for greater knowledge and comprehensive conservation efforts to ensure the species’ long-term survival. By understanding and mitigating the impacts of fish farming and other human activities, we can better protect the habitat and well-being of Chilean dolphins. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Despite attacks of bottlenose dolphins towards conspecifics and other species of dolphins being reported worldwide, inside the Mediterranean Sea these behaviours are still considered sporadic and have been, to date, only recorded in Spain and France, mostly directed to striped dolphins. In this work, we reported the necropsy outcomes of a dead striped dolphin that suggest a fatal interaction with bottlenose dolphins inside the Italian side of the Pelagos Sanctuary, Western Ligurian Sea. Results from the post-mortem examination showed multiple, multifocal external rake marks spaced 1-1.2 cm and several internal injuries, consisting of subcutaneous and muscular haematomas and haemorrhages, multiple vertebral and rib fractures, haemothorax and lung laceration. The inter-tooth distance and all the internal findings were consistent with a fatal traumatic interaction with bottlenose dolphins as reported in similar cases in other parts of the world where the same results were found. No other significant gross and microscopic findings and concurrent significant pathogens were detected. This case highlights the existence of negative interspecific interactions in an area where they have never been reported before and adds new important information to the literature for understanding their occurrence, expanding the geographical range of observation in the western Mediterranean Sea.  © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Anal glands have been identified in a variety of terrestrial and aquatic mammalian species, but there are few accounts describing their presence in cetaceans. To our knowledge, this report describes the first documented case of a pre-anal gland abscess in an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). ANIMAL A 9-year-old male bottlenose dolphin (T truncatus) part of the US Navy Marine Mammal Program in San Diego Bay, California. CLINICAL PRESENTATION, PROGRESSION, AND PROCEDURES The patient presented for a 3-day history of lethargy, failure to perform voluntary behaviors, and an elevated respiratory rate. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry results showed an inflammatory hemogram. Physical examination revealed a 4-cm circular swelling at the right pre-anal gland pore. The swelling was warm and erythematous, with multifocal pinpoint ulcerations. An abscess of the pre-anal gland was diagnosed using cytology, culture, and ultrasound. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Treatment included systemic oral antibiotic and antifungal therapy, along with daily lavage and warm compress of the gland. Treatment was successful, and the abscess resolved. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This case provides insight into a previously unreported disease process in bottlenose dolphins and encourages veterinarians to evaluate the pre-anal gland during routine physical examinations and complete further work-up if swelling or clinical signs associated with this region are present. © 2024 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we have investigated the immunolocalization of NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) and BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) in the pancreas of two species of marine mammals: Tursiops truncatus (common bottlenose dolphin), belonging to the order of the Artiodactyla, and Otaria flavescens (South American sea lion), belonging to the order of the Carnivora. Our results demonstrated a significant presence of NGF and BDNF in the pancreas of both species with a wide distribution pattern observed in the exocrine and endocrine components. We identified some differences that can be attributed to the different feeding habits of the two species, which possess a different morphological organization of the digestive system. Altogether, these preliminary observations open new perspectives on the function of neurotrophins and the adaptive mechanisms of marine mammals in the aquatic environment, suggesting potential parallels between the physiology of marine and terrestrial mammals. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Coastal bottlenose dolphin populations are highly vulnerable due to their small population sizes and proximity to human activities. Long-term studies in the UK have monitored populations protected within Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) since the 1990s, but a small community of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the coastal waters of southern England has received much less attention. The English Channel is one of the most heavily impacted marine ecosystems worldwide and increasing anthropogenic pressures pose a severe threat to the long-term viability of this population. Conservation measures to protect these animals have been hindered by a lack of knowledge of population size, distribution and ranging behaviour. This study aimed to fill these knowledge gaps. A citizen science sighting network yielded 7458 sighting reports of bottlenose dolphins between 2000 and 2020. Resightings of identified individuals were used to estimate abundance, distribution, and ranging behaviour. Social structure analysis revealed a discrete interconnected group of animals in shallow coastal waters, which did not appear to mix with conspecifics identified further offshore. A Bayesian multi-site mark–recapture analysis estimated that this population comprises around 48 animals (CV = 0.18, 95% HPDI = 38–66). These dolphins ranged between North Cornwall and Sussex, with an average individual range of 530 km (68–760 km). Areas of high-modelled habitat suitability were found to overlap with high levels of anthropogenic pressure, with pollution and boat traffic identified as the most pervasive threats. Although adult survival rates indicated that the population was relatively stable from 2008 to 2019 (0.945 (0.017 ± SE)), the small population size implies a significant risk to their long-term viability and resilience to environmental change. By highlighting the most deleterious anthropogenic activities and regions of conservation significance, our results will be useful for developing management policies for threat mitigation and population conservation, to protect this vulnerable group of dolphins. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding interactions within and between species is crucial to ecological research. However, for cetaceans such interactions can be difficult to observe in the field. Photographs offer an opportunity to study intra- and inter-specific interactions, by capturing ‘snapshots’ of their occurrence over space and time. At-surface and underwater photographs of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) inhabiting Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (PPMR), Mozambique, were used to examine evidence of interactions with other dolphins, predators and ectoparasites. Intra-specific scarring levels significantly differed by sex and age class, with males displaying more scarring than females. Similarly, adults had more scarring than juveniles or calves. Shark bites significantly differed in their distribution across dolphin body areas, with the dorsal side being more frequently wounded than the ventral side. The presence of barnacles was exclusive to fluke, dorsal and pectoral fins, and showed strong seasonal trends. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of photographs for examining marine ecological interactions. It provides the first insights regarding dolphin social behaviour, predation risk and health for this population. These in turn will support future research into the population dynamics and conservation of the PPMR dolphins, which is urgently required in the face of locally increasing anthropogenic pressures. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) rely on frequency- and amplitude-modulated whistles to communicate, and noise exposure can inhibit the success of acoustic communication through masking or causing behavioral changes in the animal. At the US Navy Marine Mammal Program (MMP) in San Diego, CA, dolphins are housed in netted enclosures in the San Diego Bay and exposed to noise from vessels, unmanned underwater vehicles, and other remote sensing devices. The acoustic behavior of 20 dolphins was monitored and whistle rates during noise events were quantified. Whistle rates during the onset of the event (i.e., the first 5 min) did not significantly differ from the pre-onset (5 min immediately preceding). Whistle rates were also not significantly different for the entire duration of the event compared to a matched control period. The noise’s frequency range (i.e., control, mid-frequency (0–20 kHz) or high-frequency (21–80 kHz)), signal-to-noise ratio, and sound pressure level were not significantly related to the dolphins’ whistle rate. Considering this is a location of frequent and moderate noise output, these results lend support to established guidelines on anthropogenic noise exposure for cetaceans, suggesting that moderate noise exposure levels may not impact communication efforts in bottlenose dolphins. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Sepetiba Bay, located in southwestern Rio de Janeiro state, in southeastern Brazil, is a region of extreme anthropogenic impact, and is home to a large population of Guiana dolphins, which face increasing and cumulative pressures on their physical health. Cetacean body condition provides a useful indicator for the evaluation of the conservation status of marine mammals. Given this, the present study quantified the proportion of dolphins with different body condition scores and assessed temporal variation in these scores between 2017 and 2022 through the analysis of photographic records. We analyzed the photographs and identified the individuals using FinFindR and classified each individual based on its apparent body condition. A total of 29,737 photographs were taken during the study, and 79 individuals were identified, of which 68.35% were in poor condition. The evidence suggests that the Guiana dolphins are in relatively poor condition overall, possibly reflecting the cumulative impact of human activities in Sepetiba Bay. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The concerning of plastic pollution in different ecosystems has been worsened by the widespread presence. Phthalate esters (PAEs), plasticizers found in everyday products, can migrate into the environment, especially into the oceans. Researches on their effects on cetaceans are still rare. Metabolomics helps assess perturbations induced by exposure to PAEs, which act as persistent endocrine disruptors. Four PAEs (dimethyl phthalate - DMP, diethyl phthalate - DEP, dibutyl phthalate - DBP, and di(2-ethylhexyl phthalate – DEHP) were analyzed, along with cholesterol and fatty acid profiles of P. blainvillei's blubber samples collected in southern Brazil. The study reveals pervasive contamination by PAEs - especially DEHP, present in all samples - with positive correlations between DEP content and animal size and weight, as well as between the DEHP amount and the C17:1 fatty acid. These findings will be relevant to conservation efforts aimed at this threatened species and overall marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Given the increased extraction of trace elements for use by new and emerging technologies, monitoring the environmental fate and potential effects of these compounds within the aquatic environment has never been more critical. Here, hepatic trace element concentrations were assessed in a key sentinel predator, the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), using a long-term dataset. Variation in concentrations were assessed in relation to other elements, time period, decomposition state, sex, age, total body length, sexual maturity and nutritional status, and cause of death. Additionally, mercury toxicity thresholds for evaluating risk were reviewed and employed. Concentrations of elements which bioaccumulate, THg, MeHg, Cd, and Pb, in addition to Se and V, were strongly correlated with age, and/or body length. An association was observed between Zn concentrations and disease status, with significantly higher concentrations measured in individuals that died from infectious disease, compared to other causes. Strong inter-elemental relationships were detected, namely between Hg and Se, MeHg and Se, Cd and Se, and Cu and Zn. While THg:Se molar ratio values were observed to increase with age and body length, approaching equimolarity. THg was largely comprised of inorganic Hg in older individuals, potentially bound to Se, therefore the effects from THg toxicity may possibly be less important than originally assumed. In contrast, higher MeHg:Hg ratio values were reported in juveniles, suggesting a poorer efficiency in demethylation and a higher sensitivity. The generation of data on proportions of hepatic MeHg and inorganic Hg is highly informative to both future toxicity threshold assessments within pollutant indicator assessments, and to understanding the ultimate fate of mercury in the marine web. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Odontocetes primarily rely on fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans as their main source of nutrition. In the digestive system, their polygastric complex exhibits similarities to that of their closest terrestrial relatives such as cows, sheep, and giraffes, while the entero-colic tract shares similarities with terrestrial carnivores. The morphology, caliber, and structure of the odontocete intestine are relatively constant, and, since there is no caecum, a distinction between the small and large intestine and their respective subdivisions is difficult. To address this issue, we used the intestinal vascularization pattern, specifically the course and branching of the celiac artery (CA) and the cranial and caudal mesenteric arteries (CrMA and CdMA). A series of pictures and dissections of 10 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were analyzed. Additionally, we performed a cast by injecting colored polyurethane foam in both arteries and veins to measure the caliber of the arteries and clarify their monopodial or dichotomous branching. Our results showed the presence of multiple duodenal arteries (DAs) detaching from the CA. The CrMA gave origin to multiple jejunal arteries, an ileocolic artery (ICA), and, in six cases, a CdMA. In four specimens, the CdMA directly originated from the abdominal aorta. The ICA gave rise to the mesenteric ileal branches (MIB) and mesenteric anti-ileal branches and the right colic arteries (RCA) and the middle colic arteries. From the CdMA originated the left colic and cranial rectal arteries (LCA and CrRA). The measurements revealed a mixed monopodial and dichotomous branching scheme. The analysis of the arteries and their branching gave us an instrument, based on comparative anatomy, to distinguish between the different intestinal compartments. We used the midpoint of anastomoses between MIB and RCA to indicate the border between the small and the large intestine, and the midpoint of anastomoses between LCA and CrRA, to tell the colon from the rectum. This pattern suggested an elongation of the duodenum and a shortening of the colic tract that is still present in this species. These findings might be related to the crucial need to possess a long duodenal tract to digest prey ingested whole without chewing. A short aboral part is also functional to avoid gas-producing colic fermentation. The rare origin of the CdMA on the CrMA might instead be a consequence of the cranial thrust of the abdominopelvic organs related to the loss of the pelvic girdle that occurred during the evolution of cetaceans. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Ensuring high standards of animal welfare is not only an ethical duty for zoos and aquariums, but it is also essential to achieve their conservation, education, and research goals. While for some species, animal welfare assessment frameworks are already in place, little has been done for marine animals under human care. Responding to this demand, the welfare committee of the European Association for Aquatic Mammals (EAAM) set up a group of experts on welfare science, cetacean biology, and zoo animal medicine across Europe. Their objective was to develop a comprehensive tool to evaluate the welfare of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), named Dolphin-WET. The tool encompasses 49 indicators that were either validated through peer review or management-based expertise. The first of its kind, the Dolphin-WET is a species-specific welfare assessment tool that provides a holistic approach to evaluating dolphin welfare. Inspired by Mellor’s Five Domains Model and the Welfare Quality®, its hierarchical structure allows for detailed assessments from overall welfare down to specific indicators. Through combining 37 animal-based and 12 resource-based indicators that are evaluated based on a two- or three-level scoring, the protocol offers a detailed evaluation of individual dolphins. This approach allows for regular internal monitoring and targeted welfare management, enabling caretakers to address specific welfare concerns effectively. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins in the wild cooperate to find food, gain and maintain access to mating partners, look after their young ones, or for the sheer joy of play. Under human care, environmental enrichments provide mental and physical stimulation and opportunities for the dolphins to practice their natural abilities. In this review, I focus on a set of enrichment devices we designed for cooperative problem-solving. They allowed the dolphins to utilize and improve their cognitive skills, leading to improved socialization within the group. While the devices provided appropriate challenges to the dolphins, they also allowed the investigation of the impact of demographic and social factors on the cooperative actions. We found that age and relatedness had no impact on cooperation; in turn, cooperation increased with group size. In addition, during the use of these cognitive enrichments, partner preference and intersexual differences were revealed in cooperative actions. The novel multi-partner devices were not only used by dolphin pairs but also by dolphin trios and quartets, providing evidence for group-level cooperation. In addition, a novel food-sharing device was used prosocially by dolphin pairs. Finally, the introduction of these cognitive enrichments leads to measurable short- and long-term welfare improvement. Thus, the use of these cognitive enrichments paired with systematic data collection bridged science with welfare. Future studies will investigate intersexual differences in independent groups, the emergence and function of cooperative interactions, and the socio-dynamics using cognitive enrichments. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Indus River dolphin (Platanista minor) is a severely threatened species of freshwater dolphin that occurs only in the lower Indus River system of Pakistan and India. The dolphin's range has declined by 80% since the 1870s, and total species abundance is estimated as approximately 2000 individuals. In 2007, a remnant population of Indus dolphins was discovered above Harike Barrage, in the Beas River in India, 600 km away from all other individuals of its species. This paper provides an overview of the conservation status of Indus dolphins in the Beas River, details the threats they face, and suggests priorities for their conservation and management. Between 2011 and 2022, 40 dolphin direct count surveys were conducted. Indus dolphins occur only in the lower third of the Beas River and reported counts have been from one to eight individuals. The data do not indicate an increase in abundance, and instead suggest a potential decrease; however, sightings of calves continue to be reported annually indicating reproduction is still taking place. Threats to the Beas River dolphin population include accidental entanglement in fishing gear, pollution, escapement downstream of Harike barrage, altered and depleted river flow regimes' and the effects of a very small population size. Urgent conservation measures are essential if this small, but important satellite population is to persist. Recommended management actions include the complete removal of fishing nets from dolphin habitat, reducing pollution, ensuring adequate river discharge to sustain aquatic ecology including dolphins, evaluating and monitoring dolphin movement through Harike barrage and into canals, and engaging riverside communities to protect dolphins. In addition, the possibility of conservation translocations to supplement this population with individuals from larger healthy populations elsewhere in the range of the species should be explored. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Finding sustainable and infinite green energy options in a world that relies primarily on fossil fuels is crucial as traditional sources decline. Wave energy is an excellent example of an environmentally friendly power source. A multi-utility bio-inspired floating device consisting of two TSUSUCA (TSUnami Protection Solar Utilization and other Coastal Applications) Dolphin-shaped bodies integrated with a linear motion electricity generator (LMEG) connected to a rigid deck by a hinged connection is tested experimentally under irregular waves. This novel and innovative multi-utility floating offshore device can function as a tsunami barrier and a wave energy extraction device. Its performance and operating mechanism are investigated under 8 different sets of irregular waves. The examined sea states are represented by JONSWAP and PM wave spectra with a range of significant wave heights (0.05–0.20 m) and peak periods (1.5 and 2.0 s). The experimental results show that the overall electrical power efficiency of LMEG coupled to each Dolphin obtained for set 6 is 32.04 % and 30.81 % for both JONSWAP and PM spectrums, respectively.

ABSTRACT: Most dolphin species produce broadband clicks for echolocation (i.e., biosonar pulses), and whistles and burst-pulsed calls for communication purposes. A few dolphin species in the Southern Ocean are reported to only produce clicks of a more narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) type, very similar to the clicks produced by porpoises. Here, we use underwater acoustic recordings of Peale's dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis) in the Falkland Islands to show that they also can produce broadband clicks and tonal whistle sounds similar to other whistling odontocete species in addition to NBHF clicks. Whistles and broadband clicks co-occurred in seven out of twelve acoustic encounters with Peale's dolphins. The co-occurrence of whistles and broadband signals, which were predominately burst-pulses, produced by Peale's dolphins in this study points to a probable function as communication signals. Furthermore, the measured frequency and time parameters of Peale's dolphin whistles were comparable with whistles recorded from four additional species in the Lagenorhynchus genus in various parts of their ranges. This is the only species of Lagenorhynchus recorded to date that can relax acoustic crypsis in a similar manner as Heaviside's (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii), Commerson's (C. commersonii), and Hector's (C. hectori) dolphins. Our findings make it likely that additional NBHF species have the ability to generate both pulsed signal types and whistles, and further challenges the acoustic classification of NBHF species. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Heavy metals are environmental contaminants and can easily accumulate and biomagnify in various marine species (fishes and mammalians) at the top of the aquatic food chain. Among marine mammalians, the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) is the most abundant cetacean in the Mediterranean Sea and is considered to be a sentinel species to monitor the environmental marine pollution. In this study, the contents of toxic metals and metalloids (Cd, Pb, Hg, and As), micro-elements (Ni, Cr, Cu, Fe, Co, Mn, Se and Zn) and macro-elements (Na, Ca, K, Mg and P) were evaluated by ICP-MS analysis in several organs/tissues (lung, skin, muscle and liver) of Stenella coeruleoalba. The assessment of marine environmental pollution and dolphins health status was carried out through further analysis of the same specific parameters such as the metal pollution index (MPI) and coefficient of condition (K). Finally, the correlation between toxic metals and metalloids and essential micro-elements, expressed as molar ratios, was analyzed to evaluate the detoxifying ability (effectiveness) of Zn, Se and Cu. Data obtained showed the presence of toxic metals and metalloids analyzed in the Stenella coeruleoalba samples but the MPI values suggested a low environmental contamination of the Mediterranean Sea where dolphins lived. The content of micro- and macro-elements was found to be in a normal range for this species and predictive of dolphins good health status, as confirmed by the coefficient of condition K. However, the correlation between toxic and essential metals, expressed as molar ratios, showed that the following toxic metals cannot be detoxified by the essential metals: 66Zn/201Hg, 82Se/201Hg, 63Cu/201Hg and 66Zn/52Cr, 82Se/52Cr, 63Cu/52Cr. Therefore, this study highlights the key role of dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba to assess marine pollution and the importance of analyzing the complete mineral profile to evaluate the animal health status. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Maritime traffic is a major contributor of anthropogenic disturbance for cetaceans, especially for coastal populations, such as that of resident common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Sado estuary (Portugal). Animals have been found to adjust their vocal behavior by changing vocal rates, or call frequency and/or duration, to overcome masking effects of underwater noise. To evaluate the potential impacts of boat traffic on the acoustic behavior of these dolphins, emission rates and acoustic characteristics of whistles and burst-pulsed signals were analyzed with and without boats operating nearby. In this study, no significant differences were found for emission rates of each type of vocal element in the presence of vessels. However, significant differences were found in acoustic parameters, namely changes in frequency and duration, for whistles and for pulsed sounds (creaks, grunts, squeaks, and gulps). These changes, such as a shift in vocal frequencies and production of shorter signals, may represent behavioral strategies to compensate for the noisy environment. Although resident bottlenose dolphins in the Sado region seem to have developed some tolerance to vessel noise, continuous noise exposure and noise-induced frequency shifts in vocal outputs could have indirect fitness costs for this population. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Society is showing a growing concern about the welfare of cetaceans in captivity as well as cetaceans in the wild threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. The study of the physiological stress response is increasingly being used to address cetacean conservation and welfare issues. Within it, a newly described technique of extracting cortisol from epidermal desquamation may serve as a non-invasive, more integrated measure of a cetacean’s stress response and welfare. However, confounding factors are common when measuring glucocorticoid hormones. In this study, we validated a steroid hormone extraction protocol and the use of a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test to measure cortisol concentrations in common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) epidermal samples. Moreover, we examined the effect of sample mass and body location on cortisol concentrations. Validation tests (i.e., assay specificity, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity) suggested that the method was suitable for the quantification of cortisol concentrations. Cortisol was extracted from small samples (0.01 g), but the amount of cortisol detected and the variability between duplicate extractions increased as the sample mass decreased. In common bottlenose dolphins, epidermal skin cortisol concentrations did not vary significantly across body locations while there was a significant effect of the individual. Overall, we present a contribution towards advancing and standardizing epidermis hormone assessments in cetaceans. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Short-latency auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded non-invasively in the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus. The stimuli were two sound clicks that were played either monaurally (both clicks to one and the same acoustic window) or dichotically (the leading stimulus (masker) to one acoustic window and the delayed stimulus (test) to the other window). The ratio of the levels of the two stimuli was 0, 10, or 20 dB (at 10 and 20 dB, the leading stimulus was of a higher level). The inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) varied from 0.15 to 10 ms. The test response magnitude was assessed by correlation analysis as a percentage of the control (non-masked) response. At monaural stimulation, the test response was of a constant magnitude (5–6% of the control) at ISIs of 0.15–0.3 ms and recovered at longer ISIs. At dichotic stimulation, the deepest suppression of the test response occurred at ISIs of 0.5–0.7 ms. The response was slightly suppressed at short ISIs (0.15–0.3 ms) and recovered at ISIs longer than 0.5–0.7 ms. The relation of parameters of the forward masking to echolocation in dolphins is discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

ABSTRACT: Long-term systematic records of cetacean strandings are valuable indicators of temporal responses of specific cetacean populations and communities to natural or anthropogenic pressures. They also help guide management objectives and conservation actions. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to analyse 10 years of systematic and opportunistic surveys of Guiana dolphin strandings in the Amazon Estuary region, Northern Brazil. The spatial distribution of strandings was assessed through kernel density maps, and age-at-death structure of this population was described. The model results revealed marked seasonality in the strandings and, by extension, the mortality of Guiana dolphins in the Amazon Estuary. This seasonality varied between the inner estuarine regions and Atlantic coastal area, reflecting the environment's characteristics. Long-term decline of strandings in the Amazon Estuary inner region and unusual high mortality of young sexually mature individuals were detected. These results, besides the high stranding rate detected for the species, are mostly attributed to the species' interaction with intense fishing activity in the region. Conservation efforts should consider the seasonality of Guiana dolphin strandings in the Amazon Estuary. The systematic monitoring of strandings, especially in high-frequency areas, is recommended for assessing long-term species mortality. Additionally, implementing management actions related to the species' interaction with fishing activities, such as regulatory enhancements, gillnet modifications and seasonal no-fishing zones, is advised. Educational campaigns targeting fishermen and riverine communities are essential to reduce bycatch and the folkloric use of the species. This study underscores the effectiveness of stranding data as a source of biological and ecological information, and as a tool for understanding human actions affecting coastal populations of aquatic mammals. It emphasizes the need for urgent studies to characterize this population, clarify the influence of bycatch as an anthropogenic pressure and implement effective conservation actions to preserve the Guiana dolphin population. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The complex and dynamic networks of river system, vital for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services, are under pressure due to human-induced water stress disrupting ecological processes. Recognition of the importance of rivers as source of life though has led to efforts towards protecting large rivers, nevertheless the conservation and management of smaller rivers remained mostly neglected, creating significant gaps in ecological restoration initiatives. In the present study, we assess the distribution and population status of Gangetic dolphin (Platanista gangetica) in the small rivers in the Ganga River Basin for integrating it into the basin wide river conservation strategy. We observed that the Gangetic dolphin inhabited most tributaries and sub-tributaries of the Ganga River, with a naïve occupancy rate of Ψ̂ = 0.68 ± 0.04 (mean ± SE) having 606 ± 142.77 (mean ± SE) individuals and accounts for 15% of the total Gangetic dolphin population in the Basin. The results of N-mixture and MaxEnt models demonstrate that channel depth, presence of meanders and water discharge were key predictors of distribution in these rivers, and the proximity to confluences were identified as a critical predictor. About 54% (620 km) of 1150 km of the surveyed river stretches exhibited suitability for dolphins in the Basin, indicated by a probability distribution score of ≥0.50. Combining this data with the available information, we delineated a total of 2850 km stretch covering entire Ganga River System suitable for Gangetic dolphins within the Basin. Notably, the 620 km of suitable stretches identified in smaller rivers represent 22% of the overall suitable stretches across the entire basin. These stretches were translated to conservation priority stretches for systematic conservation planning involving various stakeholders for improved river conservation in the Basin. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Creative or novel behaviors in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) can be indicators of flexible thinking and problem solving. Over 50 years ago, two rough-tooth dolphins demonstrated creative novel behaviors acquired through reinforcement training in human care. Since this novel training, a variety of species have been trained to respond to this conceptual cue. The current study assessed the creativity of 12 bottlenose dolphins (5 females, 7 males) housed at the Roatan Institute for Marine Sciences (RIMS) in Roatan, Honduras. Individual differences were found across four constructs measured for creativity: fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality. Variability in performance occurred across test sessions. Animals with less experience with this task performed fewer “innovative” behaviors as compared to more experienced animals. Despite errors, dolphins continued to attempt the task during test sessions, suggesting the concept of “innovate” was intrinsically rewarding and cognitively engaging. This task may be utilized across species to promote the comparative study of innovative or creative behavior as well as to promote cognitive welfare. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) is categorized as vulnerable in the Brazilian list of endangered animals, and its populations suffer from several anthropological threats. In this study, we analyzed the presence of macro, meso, and microplastics (MPs) in Guiana dolphins (n = 12) in Brazil Southeastern coast by analysing their gastrointestinal tract. The MP extractions were carried out with H2O2 (35 %) to remove organic matter. Four specimens ingested meso and macroplastics, including an item of polypropylene of 19.22 cm that was produced about 943 km from the place in which the animal was found stranded. All the specimens analyzed had fragment-type microplastics in their intestines. Blue was the prevailing color, followed by black, green, and red. We highlight the contamination by microplastics in the species, still little investigated, especially the need to understand the contamination by microplastics along trophic levels. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Organochlorine compounds (OCs) are persistent organic pollutants linked to damaging the immune and endocrine systems, leading to a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases at high concentrations. Sepetiba Bay, in the Southeastern Brazilian coast, historically presents anthropogenic activities and environmental contamination that could negatively impact resident populations. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the temporal trends in the accumulation of organochlorine compounds over a 12-year database in the Guiana dolphins’ (Sotalia guianensis) resident population from Sepetiba Bay, including individuals collected before, during, and after an unusual mortality event triggered by morbillivirus (n = 85). The influence of biological parameters was also evaluated. The OCs concentrations in the blubber ranged from 0.98 to 739 μg/g of ΣPCB; 0.08–130 μg/g of ΣDDT; <0.002–4.56 μg/g of mirex; <0.002–1.84 μg/g of ΣHCH and <0.001–0.16 μg/g of HCB in lipid weight. Increased temporal trends were found for OCs in Guiana dolphins coinciding with periods of large events of dredging in the region. In this way, our findings suggest that the constant high OCs concentrations throughout the years in this Guiana dolphin population are a result of the constant environmental disturbance in the area, such as dredging. These elevated OCs levels, e.g., ΣPCB concentrations found above the known thresholds, may impair the response of the immune system during outbreak periods, which could lead the population to a progressive decline. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cortisol is secreted from the adrenal cortex in response to stress, and its circulating levels are used as robust physiological indicators of stress intensity in various animals. Cortisol is also produced locally in adipose tissue by the conversion of steroid hormones such as cortisone, which is related to fat accumulation. Circulating cortisol levels, probably induced by cold stress, increase in cetaceans under cold conditions. However, whether cortisol production in subcutaneous adipose tissue is enhanced when fat accumulation is renewed during the cold season remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we examine the effect of environmental temperature on the expression of cortisol synthesis-related enzymes and a glucocorticoid receptor in the subcutaneous fat (blubber) and explore the association between these expressions and fluctuations in circulating cortisol levels in common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Skin biopsies were obtained seasonally from eight female dolphins, and seasonal differences in the expression of target genes in the blubber were analyzed. Blood samples were collected throughout the year, and cortisol levels were measured. We found that the expressions of cytochrome P450 family 21 subfamily A member 2 (CYP21A2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1), a glucocorticoid receptor, were increased in the cold season, and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1) showed a similar trend. Blood cortisol levels increased when the water temperature decreased. These results suggest that the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to cortisol via 11-deoxycortisol and/or of cortisone to cortisol is enhanced under cold conditions, and the physiological effects of cortisol in subcutaneous adipose tissue may contribute to on-site lipid accumulation and increase the circulating cortisol concentrations. The results obtained in this study highlight the role of cortisol in the regulation of the blubber that has developed to adapt to aquatic life. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Caring for dolphins is a delicate process that requires experienced caretakers to pay close attention to their behavioral characteristics. However, caretakers may sometimes lack experience or not be able to give their full attention, which can lead to misjudgment or oversight. To address these issues, a dolphin behavior analysis system has been designed to assist caretakers in making accurate assessments. This study utilized image preprocessing techniques to reduce sunlight reflection in the pool and enhance the outline of dolphins, making it easier to analyze their movements. The dolphins were divided into 11 key points using an open-source tool called DeepLabCut, which accurately helped mark various body parts for skeletal detection. The AquaAI Dolphin Decoder (ADD) was then used to analyze six dolphin behaviors. To improve behavior recognition accuracy, the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was introduced. The ADD and LSTM models were integrated to form the ADD-LSTM system. Several classification models, including unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM, GRU, and SVM, were compared. The results showed that the ADD module combined with a double-layer bidirectional LSTM method achieved high accuracy in dolphin behavior analysis. The accuracy rates for each behavior exceeded 90%. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Many human cultures involve positive interactions with wildlife in the past and present. Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops gephyreus), for example, have developed tactics for coastal and estuarine foraging, which sustains a fishing practice known as “cooperative fishing” by traditional fishers in estuaries of southern Brazil. Here, we use aerial footage to describe the behavioral repertoire of the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins and how it relates to the frequency of net casting by fishers in the Tramandaí Inlet. From nearly 8 h of footage from June 2017 to May 2018, we mainly observed dolphins foraging in the estuary inlet when fishers were present along the shoreline. Dolphins performed at least 27 clearly distinct behaviors and three types of movement patterns. A generalized additive model supported that the fishers interpret a subset of this repertoire (64%) as cues for casting their nets. The behavioral overview of the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins presented here demonstrates not only a diverse repertoire for this population, but also its clear influence on fishers’ activities. Scientific and traditional perspectives should be integrated to better understand the ecological significance of this “cooperative fishing” for both dolphin populations and fishers that depend on them. Significance statement: Interactions between different species can be very complex. It is a three-dimensional universe that comprises the behavioral and ecological characteristics of both sides, and then the dynamic they create together. In the case of the “cooperative fishing” between fishers and dolphins in southern Brazil, we still have one dimension to disclose in detail: the dolphins’ behavioral repertoire. Using aerial videos from a drone, we were able to shed light on how those dolphins behave and also how fishers coordinate their activity in response to the dolphins. We also showed that the dolphins’ behavioral repertoire is more diverse than assumed so far. Results suggest that the “cooperative fishing” seems to be based on the human’s perception of an extensive Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin behavioral repertoire during hunting. The knowledge provided here is essential to track the dynamic of this unique interaction in a given space and time. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Marine pollution is considered a current driver of change in the oceans and despite the urgency to develop more studies, there is limited information in the southern hemisphere. This study aimed to analyze the levels and profiles of natural (MeO-PBDEs) and anthropogenic (BFRs: PBDEs, HBB, PBEB) organic brominated compounds in adipose tissue of two species of dolphins with different distribution and trophic requirements from the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean; the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and the Fraser's dolphin (Lagenodelphis hosei). In addition, we aim to investigate maternal transfer and biological pattern relationship (sex, age, sexual maturity) in short-beaked common dolphin bioaccumulation. The levels of both groups of contaminants were in the same order of magnitude as those reported for other marine mammals on both a regional and global scale. BFRs profiles were dominated by BDE 28 and BDE 47 in short-beaked common dolphin and Fraser's dolphin, respectively, whereas 2-MeO-BDE 68 was the most abundant natural compound in both species. Evidence of maternal transfer, temporary increase in BDE 154 levels and no influence of sex, age, or sexual maturity on brominated compound concentration was observed in short-beaked common dolphin. This study fills a gap in the knowledge of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean providing new information on emerging organic pollutants bioavailability for dolphins and, therefore, for the different trophic webs. In addition, it serves as a baseline for further contamination assessments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We studied baroclinic tide generation at the Dolphin and Union Strait, a channel in the southern Canadian Arctic Archipelago that consists of a shallow sill. Utilizing both observational data and numerical simulations, we found that, due to the presence of strong stratification in the summertime, baroclinic tides are generated at both M2 and K1 frequencies as a result of the interaction between the amplified tidal currents and bottom topography. The M2 baroclinic current, which is comparable to the M2 barotropic current in terms of amplitude, is dominated by linear dynamics in the first baroclinic mode. The amplitude of the M2 baroclinic current increases as the strength of stratification increases. In contrast, the K1 baroclinic current has a smaller amplitude in general. Dynamics of the K1 baroclinic current are more complicated, possibly due to nonlinear effects as well as contributions from the higher baroclinic modes. On the other hand, increasing the strength of stratification leads to a noticeable reduction of K1 elevation in the nearby basin, but has a very minor effect on M2 elevation. © The Arctic Institute of North America.

ABSTRACT: Age is necessary information for the study of life history of wild animals. A general method to estimate the age of odontocetes is counting dental growth layer groups (GLGs). However, this method is highly invasive as it requires the capture and handling of individuals to collect their teeth. Recently, the development of DNA-based age estimation methods has been actively studied as an alternative to such invasive methods, of which many have relied on used biopsy samples. However, if DNA-based age estimation can be developed from faecal samples, age estimation can be performed entirely non-invasively. We developed an age estimation model using the methylation rate of two gene regions, GRIA2 and CDKN2A, measured through methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) from faecal samples of wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). The age of individuals was known through conducting longitudinal individual identification surveys underwater. Methylation rates were quantified from 36 samples collected from 30 individuals. Both gene regions showed a significant correlation between age and methylation rate. The age estimation model was constructed based on the methylation rates of both genes which achieved sufficient accuracy (after LOOCV: MAE = 5.08, R2 = 0.33) for the ecological studies of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, with a lifespan of 40–50 years. This is the first study to report the use of non-invasive faecal samples to estimate the age of marine mammals. © 2023 The Authors. Molecular Ecology Resources published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Aims: Gastrointestinal disease is a leading cause of morbidity in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under managed care. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) holds promise as a therapeutic tool to restore gut microbiota without antibiotic use. This prospective clinical study aimed to develop a screening protocol for FMT donors to ensure safety, determine an effective FMT administration protocol for managed dolphins, and evaluate the efficacy of FMTs in four recipient dolphins. Methods and Results: Comprehensive health monitoring was performed on donor and recipient dolphins. Fecal samples were collected before, during, and after FMT therapy. Screening of donor and recipient fecal samples was accomplished by in-house and reference lab diagnostic tests. Shotgun metagenomics was used for sequencing. Following FMT treatment, all four recipient communities experienced engraftment of novel microbial species from donor communities. Engraftment coincided with resolution of clinical signs and a sustained increase in alpha diversity. Conclusion: The donor screening protocol proved to be safe in this study and no adverse effects were observed in four recipient dolphins. Treatment coincided with improvement in clinical signs. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Applied Microbiology International.

ABSTRACT: Biopsy has recently become a preferred protocol for sampling the skin and blubber of many cetacean species, although it is desirable to collect as minimally invasive as possible. Here, the effect of biopsy sampling on the captive common bottlenose dolphins was evaluated by analyzing the process of wound healing and changes in hematological and blood biochemical parameters after biopsy using a puncher developed to collect up to the inner layer of the dolphin blubber. Results showed that the wounds caused by biopsy were closed in as early as 1 day and completely covered with the epidermis within 5–11 days. Blood fibrinogen, which generally increases due to a wound-induced inflammatory response or activation of the coagulation system, was significantly elevated after the biopsy indicating ongoing tissue repair, while other parameters did not exhibit significant differences. Furthermore, histological observation and RNA extraction of samples were performed to investigate the versatility of this method to cetacean research. Histological examination revealed three distinct layers of the blubber in the biopsy samples. Moreover, total RNA extracted from biopsy samples exhibited sufficient quality and quantity for gene expression analyses. Overall, the puncher utilized in our study represents a valuable and minimally invasive tool for investigating various aspects of small cetacean studies. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We examined the habitat use of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus around Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, Japan. Of the approximately 200 individuals that resided in the waters north of this island, about 30 individuals moved to the south around Nagashima Strait, with different environments, and then disappeared. The habitat use of these dolphins in the south was examined using land- and boat-based surveys and compared with that in the north. The ferry crew sightings were also analyzed. Intensively used areas, which were estimated using a first-passage time analysis, were shallow waters close to the shore, located around small islands or in coastal areas facing the strait. Resting behavior, characterized by low apparent moving speed and synchronous dives, was observed in the intensively used areas. The dolphins tended to be on the south side of the strait in daytime hours, and the similar trend was observed at low and ebb tides. The habitat use, such as having certain resting places, possible habitat areas at night, and tidal-affected distribution was similar to that in the north. Resting places were scattered and not stable throughout the study period. The disappearance of dolphins may be due to drop in suitability of resting places. © 2024 The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: Numerous dolphins are found dead on beaches and waterways of the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi Sound every year. In 2019 an unusual mortality event (UME) occurred when 337 deceased bottlenose dolphins were stranded between Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. According to NOAA, based on observations of skin lesions or distinct ulcerative dermatitis and other internal pathologic findings and the environmental conditions during that period of time, the identified cause of this UME was determined to be protracted exposure to low salinity waters. Dolphin carcasses are often found stranded on beaches days after they die. Consequently, their initial place of death is unknown. In this study, an existing 2D hydrodynamic model (EFDC+ 11.2) of the Mississippi Sound simulated by Armandei et al. (2021) was used to track dolphin carcass movement and to simulate salinity at the time and location of each predicted dolphin's death. Particles within the Lagrangian particle tracking module were used to represent the movement of 19 dolphin carcasses. A large number of particles (virtual dolphin carcasses) were seeded throughout the model domain and tracked for five days. These results were used to hindcast each dolphin's original location of death. The results indicate that the most likely place of death for 12 dolphins stranded on the beaches of Mississippi, along with the two found on Ship and Horn Islands, was west of their stranding location., For both of the dolphins stranded on Dauphin Island, the most likely place of death was in the Mobile Bay area north of where they were found. The remaining three dolphins found dead on barrier islands, most likely originally died in close proximity to their stranding locations. The average simulated salinity of all the dolphins' most probable original place of death was below five except for two cases. These results are compared to the salinity of the Mississippi Sound during Bonnet Carré spillway opening and non-opening dates. The results highlight the significant impact of the spillway's opening on the reduction of salinity and its association with dolphin mortality. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Vocal communication is an emblematic feature of group-living animals, used to share information and strengthen social bonds. Vocalizations are also used to coordinate group-level behaviours in many taxa, but little is known of the factors that may influence vocal behaviour during cooperative acts. Allied male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) use the 'pop' vocalization as a coercive signal when working together to herd single oestrous females. Using long-term association and acoustic data, we examined the influence of social and non-social factors on pop use by allied male dolphins in this context. Neither pop rate nor pop bout duration were influenced by any of the factors examined. However, allied males with stronger social bonds engaged in higher rates of vocal synchrony; whereby they actively matched the timing of their pop production. Hence, social bond strength influenced pop use in a cooperative context, suggesting dual functions of pop use: to induce the female to remain close, and to promote social bond maintenance and cooperation among males.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabit waters across a broad natural salinity gradient and exhibit changes in skin condition based on the quality of their environment. Prolonged exposure to low salinities (≤10–20 ppt) degenerates the epidermal barrier and causes cutaneous lesions in dolphins, while the role of high salinity exposure (>35 ppt) in lesion development remains unknown. We assessed seasonal lesion prevalence in three free-ranging dolphin stocks inhabiting coastal Gulf of Mexico (GoM) waters of different salinities (0–30 ppt, 22–35 ppt, and 36+ ppt) using images of dolphin bodies. Lesions were documented on 44% of the dolphins photographed (n = 432), and lesion occurrence was significantly related to cold seasons and water temperatures but not salinity. Cold water temperatures may heighten dolphin susceptibility to infectious pathogens and disease and compound the effects of anthropogenic pollutants in the GoM. As dolphins are a bioindicator species of marine habitat welfare, natural studies assessing dolphin skin may reveal environmental degradation with potential impacts on marine ecosystems and human health. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is rapidly affecting species distributions across the globe, particularly in the North Atlantic. For highly mobile and elusive cetaceans, the genetic data needed to understand population dynamics are often scarce. Cold-water obligate species such as the white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) face pressures from habitat shifts due to rising sea surface temperatures in addition to other direct anthropogenic threats. Unravelling the genetic connectivity between white-beaked dolphins across their range is needed to understand the extent to which climate change and anthropogenic pressures may impact species-wide genetic diversity and identify ways to protect remaining habitat. We address this by performing a population genomic assessment of white-beaked dolphins using samples from much of their contemporary range. We show that the species displays significant population structure across the North Atlantic at multiple scales. Analysis of contemporary migration rates suggests a remarkably high connectivity between populations in the western North Atlantic, Iceland and the Barents Sea, while two regional populations in the North Sea and adjacent UK and Irish waters are highly differentiated from all other clades. Our results have important implications for the conservation of white-beaked dolphins by providing guidance for the delineation of more appropriate management units and highlighting the risk that local extirpation may have on species-wide genetic diversity. In a broader context, this study highlights the importance of understanding genetic structure of all species threatened with climate change-driven range shifts to assess the risk of loss of species-wide genetic diversity. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Global ocean warming and extreme climate events pose a severe threat to marine biodiversity by inducing species redistribution and ecosystem reorganization. It is important to quantify the impacts of marine heatwaves (MHWs) on marine cetacean habitats to avoid rapid ecosystem shifts. Here we utilized detected breakpoints and early warning indicators derived from sightings data spanning from 2009 to 2021 to assess the distribution change of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). We found that (1) during the 2014 MHWs, the encounter rates (number of on-effort sightings per 100 km) of humpback dolphins in Hong Kong waters significantly decreased, with the breakpoint occurring during the autumn of 2014; (2) Since 2014, Hong Kong waters have experienced more prolonged and frequent MHWs, with a significant reduction of core habitat by 26%; according to Granger causality analysis, changes in sea surface temperature drove shifts in dolphin distribution; (3) Our analysis revealed a co-existence of rapid annual increases in MHWs and high habitat usage, with the marine park located in Southwest Lantau being particularly at risk. This study on dolphin distribution shifts and their relationships with marine heatwaves in Southern China made a contribution to our understanding of the action of marine cetaceans' response to climate change. Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering MHWs in dolphin conservation efforts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic compounds that can accumulate in high concentrations in the blubber of marine mammals, which are long-lived, top-level predators in their ecosystems. These compounds, which include DDTs, PCBs, PBDEs, HCHs, and CHLDs, impact mammalian health, including neurological effects, reduced immune system efficiency, and reproductive failure. POPs are transferred from females to their offspring during gestation and lactation, which have implications for the health of newborn marine mammals, particularly first-born offspring who receive higher concentrations. The dynamics of POP transfer during lactation have been studied in a few pinniped species, but there are no comparable studies on living cetaceans. Because life history strategies and behavior of lactating phocids differ from dolphins, a study on delphinid maternal transfer is warranted. To accomplish this, placenta and longitudinally collected blood and milk samples were taken concurrently from trained bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, mother/calf pairs to assess the dynamics of maternal contaminant transfer. Initial POP levels in placenta, blood serum, and milk varied by individual and were related to the age and reproductive history of the females. Regardless of initial POP levels, maternal serum and milk concentrations decreased while calf serum POP levels increased over time. Pollutant transfer varied by POP class and by congener. Contaminant transfer efficiency to calves was most apparent for 4- to 6‑chlorine PCBs, DDT isomers p,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDD, and o,p′-DDE, trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, heptachlor epoxide, nonachlor III, and oxychlordane. By the end of the lactation period, calf serum POP levels were considerably greater than those of their mothers, particularly for compounds with fewer chlorines. POP levels were most biomagnified in the calf born to the primiparous female. These results provide critical information on one component of contaminant transfer in the marine ecosystem and for understanding potential risks of POP exposure to developing odontocete calves. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Understanding the impact of environmental and biological factors on species’ habitat use is crucial for conservation. A regular presence of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) has recently been observed in the Western Ligurian Sea, but their distribution, habitat preferences, and social dynamics remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these aspects, focusing on spatial distribution and habitat partitioning by age classes. Data were collected during 273 boat-based surveys from April 2018 to December 2021, resulting in 146 dolphin sightings. Group size and composition were analysed based on three group-types: N-groups including at least one newborn (n = 35), C-groups with at least one calf but no newborns (n = 62) and A-groups comprising only independent juveniles, subadults and/or adults (n = 49). Using an ensemble modelling approach (BIOMOD), each group’s distribution was separately modelled incorporating seven environmental variables. Bathymetry, distance to the shelf break, bottom type and sea surface temperature emerged as the most significant predictors influencing groups’ distribution. Results showed N-groups predominantly occupying areas further from the shore, C-groups distributed across both coastal waters and areas near the shelf break and A-groups principally found very close to shore. The study suggests habitat selection and group size vary based on the unique needs and threats faced by the different age classes. These insights are highly valuable for managing bottlenose dolphins in the Ligurian Sea, considering the area’s particular morphology that leads to an important overlap between their presence and local anthropogenic activities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, is an endemic dolphin off the east coast of South America and is considered the most endangered cetacean in the western South Atlantic. In the present study, we analyzed the muscle tissue of 24 franciscana dolphins found on the coast of Espírito Santo (ES) between 2010 and 2019 to investigate trophic ecology using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. In addition, 127 prey were analyzed to identify the preferred prey. The most important prey species in the diet of the franciscana dolphins were Trichiurus lepturus, Chirocentrodon bleekerianus, and Pellona harroweri. The franciscana dolphins were grouped into three subareas according to where they were collected throughout the distribution: 1 (North), 2 (Center), and 3 (South). In subarea 1, the preferred prey were Stellifer spp., Isopisthus parvipinnis, and P. harroweri, while in subareas 2 and 3, the prey were similar, changing the order of preference among them (Stellifer spp., T. lepturus, and C. bleekerianus). Finally, we identify two possible ecological groups of franciscana dolphins on the coast of ES, influenced by different carbon sources. Our results improve our understanding of the franciscana dolphin's trophic ecology and habitat use, providing new information and guidelines for species conservation in the region. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) is an endangered species endemic to the coastal waters of Aotearoa New Zealand. To address the unsustainable bycatch of Hector's dolphins, restrictions on commercial gillnetting within 4 nautical miles of the coast were implemented in 2008, covering most of the South Island's east and south coasts. A small subpopulation of Hector's dolphins, estimated at 42 (95% CI: 19–92) in 2012, is located off Dunedin, on the south-east coast of the South Island. It is known from other locations that Hector's dolphins are distributed well beyond 4 nautical miles from the coast and hence are vulnerable to ongoing gillnetting. In this study, a combination of boat-based surveys, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and analysis of fishing effort were used to generate an up-to-date abundance estimate for Hector's dolphins off Dunedin and assess their vulnerability to commercial fishing. In the summer of 2021, abundance was estimated at 41 individuals (95% CI = 31–54), providing no evidence for population change since 2012. Analysis of visual sighting data indicated ongoing overlap between Hector's dolphins and commercial fishing effort. Using PAM, Hector's dolphins were detected on 94% of days at a location approximately 0.3 nautical miles from the coast, suggesting that shallow waters provide critical habitat for these dolphins year-round. At an offshore mooring, approximately 4.5 nautical miles from the coast and therefore outside the area in which gillnetting is prohibited, detections were made on 35% of days, indicating potential for direct overlap with commercial fisheries. The inherent vulnerability of small populations to extinction highlights the need to take a precautionary approach to the management of Dunedin's Hector's dolphins if population recovery is to be facilitated. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Invasive neuronal tract-tracing is not permitted in very large or endangered animals. This is especially the case in marine mammals like dolphins. Diffusion-weighted imaging of fiber tracts could be an alternative if feasible even in brains that have been fixed in formalin for a long time. This currently is a problem, especially for detecting crossing fibers. We applied a state-of-the-art algorithm of Diffusion-weighted imaging called Constrained Spherical Deconvolution on diffusion data of three fixed brains of bottlenose dolphins using clinical human MRI parameters and were able to identify complex fiber patterns within a voxel. Our findings indicate that in order to maintain the structural integrity of the tissue, short-term post-mortem fixation is necessary. Furthermore, pre-processing steps are essential to remove the classical Diffusion-weighted imaging artifacts from images: however, the algorithm is still able to resolve fiber tracking in regions with various signal intensities. The described imaging technique reveals complex fiber patterns in cetacean brains that have been preserved in formalin for extended periods of time and thus opens a new window into our understanding of cetacean neuroanatomy. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Dolphins have become famous for their ability to perform a wide variety of athletic and acrobatic behaviors including high-speed swimming, maneuverability, porpoising and tail stands. Tail stands are a behavior where part of the body is held vertically above the water’s surface, achieved through thrust produced by horizontal tail fluke oscillations. Strong, efficient propulsors are needed to generate the force required to support the dolphin’s body weight, exhibiting chordwise and spanwise flexibility throughout the stroke cycle. To determine how thrust production, fluke flexibility and tail stroke kinematics vary with effort, six adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were tested at three different levels based on the position of the center of mass (COM) relative to the water’s surface: low (COM below surface), medium (COM at surface) and high (COM above surface) effort. Additionally, fluke flexibility was measured as a flex index (FI=chord length/camber length) at four points in the stroke cycle: center stroke up (CU), extreme top of stroke (ET), center stroke down (CD) and extreme bottom of stroke (EB). Video recordings were analyzed to determine the weight supported above the water (thrust production), peak-to-peak amplitude, stroke frequency and FI. Force production increased with low, medium and high efforts, respectively. Stroke frequency also increased with increased effort. Amplitude remained constant with a mean 33.8% of body length. Significant differences were seen in the FI during the stroke cycle. Changes in FI and stroke frequency allowed for increased force production with effort, and the peak-to-peak amplitude was higher compared with that for horizontal swimming. © 2024.

ABSTRACT: Rhodococcus equi is a terrestrial bacterium and a common pathogen in foals (Equus caballus), in which causes pneumonia. This report describes for the first time the infection caused by R. equi in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) stranded in the Calabrian coast, Italy. The post mortem examination of the animal revealed lesions in lung and colon. The animal was also positive to dolphin morbillivirus. The histological study showed lesions attributable to R. equi infection, such as pyogranulomatous bacterial pneumonia and chronic granulomatous colitis. Whole genome sequencing of the isolated strain confirmed its identification as R. equi. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Aquaculture has maintained a sustained growth trend over the last 50 years, worldwide and in Aotearoa New Zealand. This industry is known to have environmental consequences, such as impacts on benthos, water column and higher trophic levels. Some of these impacts have been thoroughly studied, while others, such as the effects on cetaceans, are not well understood. This study used passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to assess, for the first time, the overlap between kūtai—New Zealand greenlipped mussel (Perna canaliculus)—farms and habitat use by endemic endangered Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori) within the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary. T-PODs were deployed in six bays, three with mussel farms and three without, between 2018 and 2019. Occurrence of dolphins, expressed as ‘dolphin positive minutes per day’ (DPM/day), was modelled using generalized linear mixed models. Results showed a strong interaction between farm (presence/absence) and season (summer/winter), with fewer acoustic detections of dolphins in winter if farms were present. Furthermore, in bays with mussel farms, there were significantly more click train detections on the opposite side of the bay, compared to the side by the mussel farm. Considering that results from this study suggest potential displacement of the dolphins due to the mussel farms, the recommendation is a precautionary approach. Further expansion of aquaculture in Hector's dolphin habitat should be done carefully, taking into account their habitat use, and conducting intensive monitoring including a robust ‘before and after’ design prior to the establishment of new farms. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The article performs a comparative analysis of the underwater sounds of two sympatric dolphin species living in the Black Sea: bottlenose and common dolphins. During sound processing and analysis, the special program nanoCAD 22 was used. Both the similarity of the physical parameters of the sounds of the two species and a number of specific features of whistles characteristic of each were demonstrated. Common dolphin production of some types of whistles with significant similarities (sometimes almost identical) to the signature whistles of bottlenose dolphins was detected and analyzed. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2024.

ABSTRACT: A new long-snouted homodont odontocete fossil from the Lower Miocene of Austria (ca. 22.5–22.0 Ma) is formally described and interpreted based on external skull characteristics supplemented by CT and µCT data. The specimen was found in deposits from the Central Paratethys and includes an incomplete and fragmented cranium and mandible as well as ear bones. It differs markedly from previously identified long-snouted archaic dolphins with single-rooted, homodont dentition, and thus is suggestive of a new taxon, for which the name Romaleodelphis pollerspoecki proposed. The geological context of R. pollerspoecki hints at a neritic habitat in close vicinity to estuarine environments. Romaleodelphis pollerspoecki shares key features with certain members of the so-called ‘Chilcacetus clade’ such as the widening of the premaxillae at the rostrum base and the absence of a deep lateral groove along the rostrum; however, a phylogenetic analysis reconstructs R. pollerspoecki in a polytomy with members of this ‘clade’ and a larger clade including many other taxa. To better understand the phylogenetic relationships of these taxa, comprehensive reexamination of Argryocetus and Macrodelphinus will be necessary. Measurements obtained through µCT-based internal anatomical reconstruction of the bony labyrinth indicate that R. pollerspoecki had the ability to hear specialized high-frequency signals similar to modern narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) specialists. This work further identifies several extinct platanistoids as hearing within the NBHF spectrum, increasing the understanding of the diversity of ecological adaptations in early-diverging odontocetes and providing more examples of convergent evolution of this hearing type. © 2024, by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean calves are considered fragile and vulnerable, especially in the first year of life. To guarantee safety and increase the likelihood of survival, females with calves use habitats with unique characteristics, called nursery areas. In the present study, we investigated whether the Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis, considered a threatened species in Brazil, uses the Tibau do Sul Coastal Wildlife Reserve (REFAUTS) as a nursery area. We identified the Guiana dolphins through photographs and recorded the composition of the groups during the 41-day sampling period, between 2013 and 2019. We identified 17 adults/juveniles in the company of calves, five of which were recorded in three or more years of the study. The average size of the Guiana dolphin groups (mean±SE) was 2.4±0.08 individuals, ranging from 2 to 5 individuals (n = 98). Groups with calves were recorded in every year of the study and on 53.7% of the sampling days. A total of 35.8% of the Guiana dolphin groups had calves. These results suggest that REFAUTS is an important nursery area for Guiana dolphins on the Northeast coast of Brazil. © 2024 Romanian Inventors Forum. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins produce narrowband and frequency modulated sounds called whistles during a variety of behavioral contexts. Dolphin species vary in their whistle contour composition, frequency range, modulation, and duration, and these differences can be useful in their identification. Here, we compare the whistle contours of two sympatric dolphin species at La Paz Bay, Gulf of California, the Eastern Tropical Pacific bottlenose dolphin, and the long-beaked common dolphin. Dolphins were recorded (7 h and 1 min recording effort) from the research vessel with the engine off using an over-the-side hydrophone and a broadband recording system. A total of 666 high quality whistles (bottlenose dolphin, n = 415; long-beaked common dolphin, n = 251) were analyzed. A Random Forest Analysis identified duration, ending frequency, and maximum frequency as the most important variables that distinguish the two dolphin species. The most common whistle contour types of bottlenose dolphins were sine and convex, while the long-beaked common dolphins produced mainly upsweep and concave whistles. The results showed that bottlenose dolphins and long-beaked common dolphins differ in their whistle variables and contours facilitating their identification in future passive acoustic studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Emotions in animals may be expressed by arousal and understanding this often relies upon the monitoring of their behaviour. Under human care, animals’ arousal states may be linked to husbandry decisions, whereby animals may display arousal responses to scheduled events such as feeding and human interaction. Here, we investigate vocal correlates of arousal associated with public presentations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) in human care by comparing vocal production rates and characteristics between high and low arousal contexts. Elevated arousal during the day compared with overnight was characterised by increased signature and non-signature whistle production. High intensity broadband crack vocalisations were produced less than whistles during the day and did not correlate with increased arousal around presentation times. Three of ten dolphins increased signature whistle production before and/or after presentation sessions, indicating elevated arousal and variation in individual responses. Many individuals elevated minimum frequency and suppressed maximum frequency of signature whistles in a way that correlated with higher arousal contexts, indicating that these may therefore be good indicators of changes in arousal state. Overall, our study demonstrates that passive acoustic monitoring can provide a useful indication of arousal linked to husbandry decisions, and that individual variation in vocal responses, likely linked to personality, is important to consider. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The behavioral plasticity among and within cetacean species can be driven by their prey sources, local adaptations to environmental features, and/or interactions with human activities. One of the tactics displayed by cetaceans is the barrier feeding, in which individuals or groups herd fish schools against natural and non-natural barriers to restrict movements of their prey. Coastal odontocetes, for example, are known for using shorelines and underwater slopes to trap their prey. Here, we documented two distinct populations of Guiana dolphin using the mangrove margins as a natural barrier to herd and capture fish. The observations took place in the Cananéia estuary, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil, and in the Paranaguá estuary, Paraná State, southern Brazil. A total of 63 dolphins over eight encounters were observed performing six different events using mangroves as a natural barrier, summing both study areas. These findings not only expand our understanding of the behavior plasticity of the species but also call attention to the importance of the mangrove ecosystem directly to Guiana dolphins and indirectly to the components of their food web. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region on the southeast coast of China is among the largest and most populated metropolitan regions of the world, subjecting the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) inhabiting coastal waters of this region – apparently the largest population of this species – to intense anthropogenic pressure. In this 5-year study (2011-2015), we applied mark-recapture techniques to quantify population parameters of humpback dolphins in the main body of the extensive estuarine system of the Pearl River, the Lingding Bay (LB), the most urbanized and industrialized part of PRD. The super-population size was estimated at 928 individuals (95% CI=823-1046), which however over-represents the latest number of extant animals. Annual estimates fluctuated between 708 and 750 dolphins, and likely reflect most accurately the latest/current number of humpback dolphins in waters of LB. Both the overall and annual estimates generated by our study are considerably lower than previously published abundance estimates. Apparent survival rates were generally low, estimated at 0.943 (SE = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.929-0.958) and 0.815 (SE = 0.025, 95% CI = 0.766-0.866) for adults and juveniles, respectively. In conjunction with limited recruitment, they may have led to a substantial decline in population numbers over the past two decades. Notably, dolphins exhibited heterogeneous apparent survival rates across the complex anthropogenic seascape of LB. Adult individuals that use Hong Kong waters as their primary habitat exhibited 6.2% higher survival rates than those in other parts of LB. This difference tripled (19.2%) for juveniles, a likely expression of their susceptibility to environmental and/or anthropogenic stresses. We suggest that the difference in survival is largely due to heterogeneous anthropogenic stressors that vary spatially across the estuary, among which habitat loss, pollution, and declining prey resources appear to be the primary threats. Based on our latest findings, we call for a strategic conservation planning with the highest priority given to preserve the remaining key dolphin habitats in Hong Kong waters, and to quantify and mitigate the impacts of major stressor(s) in Guangdong (mainland China) waters. Given the encroachment of ever-more-intense human activities on the coastal habitats of humpback dolphins, understanding their demographic response and the underlying mechanisms of the population processes may prove instrumental in the formulation of a conservation management strategy that can secure their continuous survival.

ABSTRACT: Qualitative ratings are increasingly used to assess animal welfare. We investigated the associations between daily caretakers’ ratings of individuals’ behavioral style, behavior during free time, participation during training sessions, and environmental variables in captive Yangtze finless porpoises, East-Asian finless porpoises, and bottlenose dolphins. Associations between caretakers’ ratings and behavior were found, including social swimming, fast swimming, play, interaction with humans, and agonistic and socio-sexual interactions. Ratings were also associated with participation during training sessions and food intake. Social separation, transport to a new pool, high visitors’ density, and holding of a sick conspecific were associated with ratings indicating a deteriorated human–animal relationship, a lower interest/fear of the environment, and/or a higher social cohesion depending on the group. Through principal component analyses, new variables that represented both caretakers’ ratings and behavior and that could be used for an easier interpretation of the data for welfare monitoring within each group were extracted. Caretaker ratings and behavior should be used as a complement to previously validated indicators to detect changes in welfare state and understand the potential causes of these changes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: There is no current population estimate for Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) in Scottish waters and their distribution in the northeast of Scotland and the Northern Isles is poorly documented. Using a combination of citizen science and historical sightings data, photographs of Risso’s dolphins from northeast Scotland and the Northern Isles were gathered to gain an indication of the presence of the species in this region. A review of all available sighting records from as early as 1933 (n = 1,904 records), showed a historical presence of Risso’s dolphins in the study locations, with a notable increase in sightings reports over time and with higher numbers of sightings reported from July-September. Collation of photographs (n = 1,884) taken by members of the public and researchers facilitated the establishment of two photo-identification catalogues for Northeast Scotland and Orkney (n = 112 individuals) and for Shetland (n = 47 individuals) respectively. Mother/calf pairs were recorded between April and November. Repeated recaptures of identifiable animals throughout the study area provided the first evidence of inter/intra-annual site fidelity. The combined datasets demonstrate the potential importance of inshore coastal waters in northeast Scotland, Orkney, and Shetland as critical habitat for Risso’s dolphins. Recommendations are made for ongoing monitoring studies to inform the protection of Risso’s dolphins in Scottish waters.

ABSTRACT: Most intrinsic muscles of the forelimb in dolphins are either degenerated or lost; however, the muscles around the shoulder joint are well preserved. We dissected the forelimbs of Pacific white-sided dolphins and constructed a full-scale model of the flipper to compare and examine their movements following dissection. The humerus was oriented at approximately 45° ventrally from the horizontal plane of the dolphin and 45° caudally from the frontal plane. This maintains the neutral position of the flipper. The deltoideus and pectoralis major muscles were inserted into the body of the humerus, and the flipper was moved in the dorsal and ventral directions, respectively. A large tubercle, known as the common tubercle, was observed at the medial end of the humerus. Four muscles were inserted into the common tubercle: the brachiocephalicus, supraspinatus, and cranial part of the subscapularis, which laterally rotated the common tubercle. Subsequently, the flipper swung forward, and its radial edge was lifted. Conversely, the medial rotation of the common tubercle caused by the coracobrachialis and the caudal part of the subscapularis was accompanied by backward swinging of the flipper and lowering of the radial edge. These findings suggest the function of the flipper as a stabilizer or rudder is caused by the rotation of the humerus's common tubercle. © 2023 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) are commonly found in shallow waters from South and Central America. From March 2018 to June 2019, boat surveys were conducted to monitor two populations inhabiting the adjacent waters of Ilha Grande Bay and Sepetiba Bay to estimate population abundances and population parameters of apparent survival and capture probability. Photo-identification was used as a mark-recapture technique. A total of 672 dolphins was cataloged in Ilha Grande Bay and 826 in Sepetiba Bay, with two individuals being photographed in both areas. Population parameters were estimated through mark-recapture models and total population abundance was estimated at 1,949 and 1,560 individuals in Ilha Grande Bay and Sepetiba Bay, respectively. Seasonal estimates were modeled showing that the Sepetiba Bay population may have stronger site fidelity to the study area than individuals in Ilha Grande Bay. Apparent survival was estimated in a mixed model framework avoiding bias due to the large presence of transient individuals. The estimates presented here are a result of an effort conducted months after an unusual mortality event linked to Guiana dolphin cetacean morbillivirus and our findings indicated that surviving individuals did not have long-term deadly effects, but continuous efforts should be considered for a long-term evaluation. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Potential anthropogenic stressors on marine fauna continue to increase, yet how marine mammals fare under these conditions remains largely unmeasured. For example, noise sources may trigger a stress response in whales and dolphins, which typically causes health and cognitive deficits in other mammals. Yet, we do not have data of sufficient quality to demonstrated how anthropogenic impacts on these highly protected and unique species. The objective of this project is to collect health data from dolphin blowhole mucus as animals surface to breathe using a custom uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) developed for cetacean applications. While COTS rotary wing UAS have been used to collect samples from large whales, smaller cetaceans such as dolphins present a greater challenge for sample collection in the wild. Data from observations indicate that the use of standard commercial drones will result in inaccurate data as the system noise will likely increase stress hormone levels and chase subjects away. Furthermore, rotary wing UAS are likely to blow viable samples away through downwash from the spinning blades. However, silent fixed-wing capable UAS will enable accurate estimation of stress levels, pathogen load, and microbiological contaminants through the successful collection of blow samples, since dolphins should be unable hear and see the drone based on observations mapping dolphin field of vision as well as their sensitivity to different drone sounds. The paper summarizes the design, development, and successful demonstration of the PHASM (Passive Health Assessment of Sea Mammals) UAS for collection of blowhole mucus samples from dolphins. © 2024, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

ABSTRACT: Descriptions of social structure of a species or population help to understand the processes that shaped its social system, and such knowledge can be valuable in terms of conservation planning. While striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba are among the most abundant cetacean species worldwide, and the most abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, their social and community structure is poorly known. This study investigates the association patterns of a population inhabiting the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. A total of 501 individuals were photo-identified across 7 years (2011–2017). Groups were significantly larger (M = 44.7, SD = 46.3) than those studied to date in other Mediterranean areas. Association analyses in SOCPROG relied on the time and position metadata of dorsal fin photographs. Results indicated a single community characterized by nonrandom associations and a loose clustering of individuals (best division into clusters corresponded to an association index of 0.02). The high degree of social cohesion may result in part from geographic isolation within a semienclosed basin.

ABSTRACT: Information on the feeding habits of the critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella breviros-tris) in the Mekong River and how their diet over-laps with that of the species targeted by fisheries is limited. The information provided herein will be helpful for evaluating and protecting important dol-phin food resources. The composition of large prey species of Irrawaddy dolphins and the extent of fish resources were surveyed in the Mekong River, Cambodia, using local ecological knowledge. The results showed that Irrawaddy dolphins fed on 13 species of large fish, with Pangasius conchophilus, Cyclocheilichthys enoplos, and Hemibagrus wyckii the most frequently consumed prey. Twelve of the 13 reported prey species were usually caught by fishers. The results also revealed that the average weight of fish caught daily by fishers was signifi-cantly lower in 2019 than about five years before that, regardless of the season. A significant decline in fish resources and a high overlap of dolphin diets with fishery target species indicate that Irrawaddy dolphins may also be threatened by prey depletion, especially during the dry season when dolphins are concentrated in deep pools. © (2024), (Western Illinois University).

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activity in coastal areas can damage marine habitats and alter marine mammal behavior and habitat use. Understanding behavioral associations with diverse habitat features in industrialized coastal areas is crucial for marine mammal conservation management. A shore-based digital theodolite was used to assess the behavioral states and habitat use of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) off Port Aransas, Texas across seasons. The relationship between behavioral states and environmental and geographical variables were analyzed. Behavioral hotspots were identified. Dolphins frequently foraged (46%), indicating the area is an important feeding ground. Dolphins also traveled (25%) and milled (22%), with less frequent occurrences of socializing (6%) and resting (1% of observations). Season, time of day, and distance to shoreline were significant predictors of foraging and traveling behavioral states. Dolphins engaged in all behavioral states closer to seawall shorelines than to mangroves and natural seagrass beds, suggesting that hard shoreline features may influence daily activity patterns. Despite daily anthropogenic operations, bottlenose dolphins use features of the industrialized area (i.e., deeply dredged channels, human-engineered seawalls) to engage in a variety of behaviors. Monitoring of dolphin behavioral states and habitat use in active ship channels are needed to assess changes from baseline data from increasing coastal development and vessel activities.

ABSTRACT: Anticipatory behavior describes the actions taken to prepare for an upcoming event. It is considered a promising tool for welfare assessment, but it is not fully applied in zoos and other facilities. This is probably due to the need to train animals, which can take a long time and make its use impractical. In this work, we tested, on a group of six dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), the effectiveness of a new technique to induce and measure anticipatory behavior without training animals. Our results show how this new methodology, which we called The Fast Technique (TFT), has been able to induce and measure anticipatory behavior toward the event studied, i.e., the play sessions with objects (PSO). Furthermore, it has produced the same result obtained with The Classical Technique (TCT), which requires a training phase. Therefore, our finding demonstrates the efficacy of a new technique that could facilitate the use of anticipatory behavior for both research and animal welfare assessment protocols. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses infect numerous non-human species. Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into novel animal reservoirs may present a danger to host individuals of these species, particularly worrisome in populations already endangered or threatened by extinction. In addition, emergence in new reservoirs could pose spillback threats to humans, especially in the form of virus variants that further mutate when infecting other animal hosts. Previous work suggests beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) may be at risk owing to their formation of social groups, contact with humans, exposure to contaminated wastewater, and structure of their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins, which SARS-CoV-2 uses as a cellular receptor. We examined marine-mammal susceptibility to virus infection by challenging 293T cells expressing beluga or dolphin ACE2 with pseudovirions bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Beluga and dolphin ACE2 were sufficient to allow cell entry by an early pandemic isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1) and two evolved variants (Delta B.1.617.2 and Omicron BA.1 strains). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 poses a potential threat to marine mammal reservoirs that should be considered in surveillance efforts. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are social animals that depend on sound to communicate, navigate, and find food. The aim of our research was to describe dolphin whistle characteristics and compare whistles between two isolated populations of bottlenose dolphins in New Zealand. We focused on three aspects of dolphin bioacoustics (1) classification of whistles; (2) comparison of the whistles of two discrete bottlenose dolphin populations; and (3) comparison of whistles of dolphin populations from around the world. At Great Barrier Island, the most common type of whistle was upsweep followed by sine, while at Doubtful Sound, convex and sine whistles were the most common whistle types. Random Forest models discriminated between whistles from the two populations with an estimated accuracy of 90%. The key differences were whistle-type contour, duration, and end frequency. Linear Mixed models show that whistle acoustic parameters were influenced by location but not by group size or the presence of immatures. Whistle parameters of both populations fell within the range of multiple populations from around the world. This studyprovides a benchmark for future research into drivers of geographic variation in dolphin vocal communication. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Food has regularly been proven to be a key source of exposure to environmental pollutants, drawing attention to the dietary exposure risks of contaminants to mammals with significant daily food intake. Here, the levels of six organotin compounds (OTs) in 18 fish (n = 310), three cephalopods (n = 50), and one shrimp (n = 34) from the Lingdingyang (LDY) and west four region (WFR) of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and their dietary exposure risks to Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and humans were first investigated. Total OT levels ranged from 3.84 to 901. 48 ng/g wet weight (ww) in 22 prey species from the LDY, and from 14.37 to 1364.64 ng/g ww in 19 species from the WFR. The LDY marine species generally accumulated higher butyltin levels but lower phentyltin levels than those in the WFR. All species have a phenyltin degradation index <1 and over 60 % of the sampled species have a butyltin degradation index <1, suggesting the PRE marine species might be exposed to the fresh discharge of OTs. A total of nine marine species exceeded the threshold levels of OT intake for adverse health effects on human juveniles by consumption, all 22 marine species posed high dietary risks to the PRE humpback dolphins. Moreover, probabilistic risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the probabilities of RQ values associated with WFR OT exposure higher than 1 were 18.87 % for human adults, 40.55 % for human juveniles, 100 % for both humpback dolphin adults and humpback dolphin juveniles. Our results highlighted the potentially high dietary exposure risks of OTs to marine mammals and residents in the PRE. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The relationship between a dolphin mother and her calf has been well studied, but details regarding tactile exchanges within these dyads are limited. Contacts between five adult female bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and their calves, with data from three pairs analyzed statistically, were examined from video collected in October 2017, 2018, 2019, and in January 2018. Of 289 contact events, calves initiated 65.7% (n = 190), of which 82.6% (n = 157) were affiliative; 77.8% (n = 77) of mother-initiated contacts were categorized similarly. Thus, the overall trend for mother-calf contacts was affiliative. Mothers initiated contact with the dorsal fin less often (n = 3), while calves initiated with their dorsal fin more often (n = 40), especially one-year-old (C1) calves (n = 33). The body was used to initiate contact more by three-year-old (C3) calves (n = 47) and less by C1 calves (n = 22). Both results are likely an artifact of the infant position used by calves at different developmental stages. Only two-year-old (C2) calves initiated agonistic contact with their rostrum (n = 4); 75% of these contacts were initiated by one male calf. Mothers used the body to initiate contact with most calf ages, though contact by pectoral fin occurred more often than expected with their C2 calves (n = 11). Since 72.7% of these contacts came from one mother, a specific maternal style may be present. Only one mother used her rostrum with her C3 calf to initiate agonistic contacts; all others used the fluke. Several variables, including individual preference, calf sex, and maternal experience, may explain some of the contact patterns, but a larger sample size is needed to illustrate potential patterns among pairs. Still, these results support the notion that mothercalf dyads share more affiliative than agonistic contacts, expanding our knowledge on the tactile relationships of mother-calf pairs. © (2024), (European Association for Aquatic Mammals).

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans can serve as sentinel species in marine environments as long-lived, apex predators that can concentrate environmental contaminants with potential health consequences. Thus, monitoring the well-being of these species may provide an additional indicator of ecosystem health. In cetaceans, one method for assessing individual and population health is by examining skin conditions. For decades, skin lesions have been increasingly documented in coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) worldwide. Lesion presence can indicate diminished health and may reflect environmental stressors. Herein, we document the prevalence of epidermal lesions/marks in bottlenose dolphins from the waters off New York and New Jersey during their seasonal presence from spring to fall. Photographs of distinct individuals sighted from May to October 2017 to 2021 were compiled into a catalog, and skin lesions were categorized and counted. Annually, the lowest skin lesion prevalence was in 2021 (p = 0.31), and the highest was in 2017 (p = 0.81). By month, prevalence generally decreased from spring to fall. Overall lesion prevalence in this population was higher than reported estimates for other populations in the coastal waters of the United States. The five most common categories were cloudy white spots, dark spots, white amorphous lesions, tattoo lesions, and dark fringe lesions; and the three most common groups were potentially pathogenic lesions, hypopigmentation, and rake mark-associated potentially pathogenic lesions. Some of the observed lesions have been associated with viral infections that may be exacerbated by environmental stressors. This research establishes an important baseline for further studies into bottlenose dolphin population health in and around the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary, particularly given the continued expansion of anthropogenic activities, including those related to forthcoming offshore wind development. © (2024), (European Association for Aquatic Mammals).

ABSTRACT: Microplastic ingestion was reported for common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting Sarasota Bay, FL, USA, a community that also has prevalent exposure to plasticizers (i.e., phthalates) at concentrations higher than human reference populations. Exposure sources are currently unknown, but plastic-contaminated prey could be a vector. To explore the potential for trophic exposure, prey fish muscle and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) tissues and contents were screened for suspected microplastics, and particle properties (e.g., color, shape, surface texture) were compared with those observed in gastric samples from free-ranging dolphins. Twenty-nine fish across four species (hardhead catfish, Ariopsis felis; pigfish, Orthopristis chrysoptera; pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides; and Gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta) were collected from Sarasota Bay during September 2022. Overall, 97% of fish (n = 28) had suspected microplastics, and GIT abundance was higher than muscle. Fish and dolphin samples contained fibers and films; however, foams were common in dolphin samples and not observed in fish. Suspected tire wear particles (TWPs) were not in dolphin samples, but 23.1% and 32.0% of fish muscle and GIT samples, respectively, contained at least one suspected TWP. While some similarities in particles were shared between dolphins and fish, small sample sizes and incongruent findings for foams and TWPs suggest further investigation is warranted to understand trophic transfer potential. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Sindhudurg coast in Maharashtra, India, supports diverse fisheries and is a vital habitat for the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea, a species found nearshore along the west coast of India. Here, dolphins cause economic losses to fishermen by competing for catch and damaging fishing gear. Dolphins are also affected by entanglement in or ingestion of parts of fishing nets. There is a need for a systematic assessment of the distribution of risks to dolphins and the specific fisheries most impacted by interactions with dolphins. To bridge this information gap, we (1) analysed the behaviour and locations of dolphin groups in the absence and presence of fishing vessels (2012—2015) and (2) mapped the spatial overlap of dolphins and fishing vessels (2014— 2015) to determine high-risk areas for dolphins. We observed 175 dolphin groups, of which 75 groups (43%) engaged in foraging behaviours. Dolphins occurred in approximately 50% (164 km2) of the total survey area, and fishing vessels were observed in 100% of the total survey area (333 km2). The proportion of dolphin groups engaged in foraging behaviours was significantly higher when fishing vessels were present compared to when absent. Gillnet (55%) and trawl (32%) accounted for the majority of observed fishing vessels when dolphins were present. Gillnet vessels had a 95% spatial overlap with dolphin habitat, and trawl and purse-seine vessels each had 86%. We identified 8 high-risk areas that were within ~500 m of the coastline, coinciding with high-density dolphin habitat near estuaries.

ABSTRACT: Extracting parameter information from active sonar target echoes can be used to effectively implement underwater target recognition, and dolphin sonar has shown an excellent performance in underwater target recognition. This paper refers to the processing method of underwater signals based on dolphin hearing and investigates parameter estimation of underwater targets based on the auditory perception model of dolphin. The target acoustic scattering echo was processed by the auditory perception model. The radius and thickness estimation of spherical shell were attained using reconstruction methods. Finally, the proposed method was validated experimentally. © 2024 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: As highly social animals, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) exhibit community differentiation. Nevertheless, our understanding of the external and internal factors influencing these dynamics, as well as their spatiotemporal variations, is still limited. In the present study, variations in the social structure of an endangered Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin population in Xiamen Bay, China, were monitored over two distinct periods (2007–2010 and 2017–2019) to analyze the effects of habitat utilization and the composition of individuals within the population. In both periods, the population demonstrated a strikingly similar pattern of social differentiation, characterized by the division of individuals into two main clusters and one small cluster. Spatially, the two primary clusters occupied the eastern and western waters, respectively, although the core distribution area of the eastern cluster shifted further eastward between the two periods. Despite this distribution shift, the temporal stability of the social structure and inter-associations within the eastern cluster remained unaffected. A subset of 16 individuals observed in both periods, comprising 51.6% and 43.2% of the population in each respective period, emerged as a foundational element of the social structure and may be responsible for sustaining social structure stability, especially during the 2007–2010 period. These observations suggest that the composition of dominant individuals, an internal factor, had a more substantial influence on the formation of the social network than changes in habitat use, an external factor. Consequently, the study proposes distinct conservation measures tailored to each of the two main clusters.

ABSTRACT: The striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) is a cosmopolitan cetacean and the most commonly sighted dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea. It usually appears in groups of very different sizes, ranging from less than ten to more than 500 individuals, although it is usually found in groups of between 21 and 50 individuals. In the western Mediterranean, and more specifically in the Gulf of Mazarrón, S. coeruleoalba was the most frequently sighted cetacean during the 1042 whale-watching trips. The goal of this study was to establish the spatial and temporal distribution of striped dolphin sightings along the Gulf of Mazarrón between 2004 and 2014. Spatial patterns were analysed using a Random Forest based Species Distribution Model to estimate the presence of the species. Twentythree variables (three geographic, one temporal, eight geomorphometric and twelve oceanographic) were used as predictors. Out of the 1042 cruises, 872 records of striped dolphins were obtained. Some variations in the grouping patterns of these mammals were observed during the years 2006–2007, with an average shift in the size of the groups to fewer individuals (3−10). This variation is probably related to an epizootic event of morbillivirus occurring during those years, which was responsible for an abnormal rate of strandings of striped dolphins and long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). The Random Forest model allowed to select 6 predictors related to morphometry and sea currents, suggesting the importance of specific habitat in offshore areas between 1000 and 3000 m depth in the continental slope. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The Peruvian coast is considered the southern limit of the distribution area of the pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. However, sightings of this species were scattered and scarce. This study reports an unexpected increase in sightings of this species in northern Peru from 2021 to 2023. Over this period, a total of 34 groups were recorded, with 85.3 % (n = 29) observed just in 2023. This significant rise in sightings suggests shifts in dolphin distribution related to rising sea surface temperatures associated with a strong El Niño event. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Amazon River dolphins are an important flagship species in the Anavilhanas National Park, Brazil, where they interact with visitors. This study aimed to quantify and identify fungi isolated from dolphin skin and oral samples and their surrounding environment in this unique ecosystem. Samples were collected from three dolphins and water samples from Flutuante dos Botos and the Novo Airão city harbor. Fungi were isolated using culture media and identified through micromorphology assays and ITS region sequencing. Oral swab samples resulted in culture of Trichosporon montevideense and Exophiala dermatitidis. Skin samples from one dolphin revealed Toxicocladosporium irritans and Diaporthe lithocarpus. Water samples exhibited higher fungal counts and diversity, with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Exophiala dermatitidis, Penicillium citrinum, Fomitopsis meliae, and Nectria pseudotrichia identified at the collection site and Candida spencermartinsiae and Penicillium chermesinum at the city harbor. This study provides important insights into the fungal diversity associated with Amazon River dolphins and their environment, enhancing our understanding of the public health and ecological dynamics in the Anavilhanas National Park.  © 2024 Marla Jalene Alves et al.

ABSTRACT: Small vessels contribute substantially to coastal soundscapes, presenting myriad potential impacts on marine species and ecosystems, yet are challenging to monitor using standard tracking methods (e.g. AIS). Here, we present an automated camera system developed to quantify coastal vessel traffic in a core habitat for Hector’s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) within Akaroa Harbour, Aotearoa New Zealand. Analysis of 55,569 images taken during the austral summer of 2019/20 showed that traffic was highest around midday, on weekends, and in January. A mean of 41.9 vessel trips per day transited the area of core habitat. Vessel speeds estimated from photographs were assigned to 5-knot bins with 84% accuracy. Findings suggest vessel traffic in Akaroa Harbour has approximately doubled between 2006–2008 and 2020. Additionally, tours focused specifically on dolphins composed a significantly larger proportion of vessel traffic in 2020 than observed during 2006–2008. We validate the use of an automated camera system as a robust, novel, repeatable, and cost-effective tool for quantifying fluctuations in coastal vessel traffic. Such tools can provide baseline data and help assess impacts, and their use can guide management action. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Providing abundance estimates for cetaceans is essential for their conservation and management. Passive acoustics provide a cost-effective option that is being increasingly explored. One promising approach is to use signature whistles within a capture-recapture framework. In this study, both photo-ID and acoustic data of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were collected between August and October 2019 off Northumberland, United Kingdom. A total of 26 surveys were conducted and 5771 h of acoustic data were recorded across three sites. The resulting photo-ID catalog contained 43 noncalf individuals and 45 unique signature whistle types were identified using the SIGnature IDentification method. Each dataset was analyzed using closed capture-recapture models and different modeling approaches were considered for the whistle data, including Spatially Explicit Capture Recapture (SECR). The resulting total abundance estimate from photo-ID data was 60 (95% CI 49 to 73) individuals. Using the photo-ID estimate as benchmark, the whistle data modeling approach that provided the most similar estimate was SECR, resulting in 66 (95% CI 56–104) individuals. The study provides further evidence of the applicability of using signature whistles for estimating abundance of bottlenose dolphins and provides the first abundance estimates for the species off Northumberland, United Kingdom. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The location of offshore and coastal marine engineering projects often shows considerable overlap with the foraging and breeding grounds of marine mammals. Lingding Bay, located in the Chinese Pearl River Delta, is home to the world’s largest known population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis). The bay is also the site of the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge mega-engineering project. This study assessed the responses of the dolphins to the bridge construction. Data were collected on dolphin sightings by survey vessels following standard line-transect tracks, with surveys conducted during the pre-construction (2005–2006), construction (2015–2016), and post-construction (2020–2021) phases. The dolphin distribution patterns, density, group sizes, and presence of calves were compared across these three periods. Additionally, the range patterns of the dolphins were analyzed following the identification of individuals during the post-construction phase. The average distance at which humpback dolphins were sighted from the bridge was significantly shorter after the completion of the bridge than during the pre-construction and construction phases. Furthermore, the density of humpback dolphins in the southern region of the bay—where the bridge is located—was significantly higher post-construction compared with that recorded during the pre-construction and construction phases. A noticeable increase in dolphin group sizes post-construction may indicate a shift in foraging strategy. The post-construction phase coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, and the resultant reduced human activity in Lingding Bay may have influenced the distribution of dolphins and other animals to some extent. Individual identification results demonstrated that the waters near the bridge remained an integral habitat for the dolphins post-construction, as they freely traversed underneath the bridge. The results of this study hold considerable importance within the realm of marine engineering, offering valuable guidance and references for informed decision-making and operational practices in associated domains.

ABSTRACT: Age of cetaceans is an important data set for their conservation and management. Although the chronological age of a toothed whale has traditionally estimated from the number of annual tooth growth layer groups (GLGs), this method has potential difficulties such as errors due to the subjectivity of the age-readers and time-consuming sample processing, in addition to lethal tooth sampling in many cases. To overcome these difficulties through a non-lethal approach, considerable amount of efforts has been made in recent years to construct chronological age estimation models based on the correlation between chronological and biological age expressed as the frequency of DNA methylation at CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites. The present study, by using next-generation sequencing on DNA extracted from the skin tissues of 30 individuals (15 males and 15 females), performed methylation analysis on multiple CpG sites in the three genes previously reported as age-linked in cetaceans (GRIA2, TET2, and CDKN2A) to construct an age estimation model for Risso’s dolphins. Key aspects of this study are: (1) the chronological ages of Risso’s dolphins of wild origins used in this study had been determined by the GLGs of teeth prior to this study, and (2) as Risso’s dolphins are said to have a lifespan of 30 years, samples were collected from individuals aged 1–29 years, covering from young to old ages. Among the 11 CpG sites in GRIA2, 6 CpG sites in TET2, and 7 CpG sites in CDKN2A analyzed, the CpG sites in GRIA2 showed a statistically significant correlation with age, whereas those in TET2 and CDKN2A did not show such a strong correlation. Using multiple regression analysis on the CpG sites in the three genes, the best fitted model was expressed as follows: y=-0.7548 + 5.6164x(GRIA2_CpG3)+2.6187x(TET2_CpG6)-1.5907x(CDKN2A_CpG3) (R²=0.7062, residual mean=2.98, standard deviation=2.3). With the mean error of 2.98 years between the estimated and known chronological ages, the accuracy of this model was found to be comparable to or higher than that of previously reported age estimation models for cetaceans. This study demonstrated for the future that the age of wild Risso’s dolphins can be estimated by using their skin samples collected with minimal invasiveness.

ABSTRACT: For more than 140 years, the type locality of the Hector’s dolphin, Cephalorhynchus hectori [Van Beneden 1881] and the whereabouts of the holotype have been in question. The species was based on a specimen from New Zealand, sent to Otto Finsch in Germany. Finsch forwarded the specimen to Pierre-Joseph Van Beneden in Belgium who described it as Electra hectori, without specifying whether its location was the NE coast of the South or the North Island. Of the six persons who may have shipped out the holotype, von Haast, Hutton, or Travers are the most likely; Potts, Hector and Buller are less plausible. The connections between NZ and European museums were analysed. Based on our review and the rarity of records from the NE coast of the North Island, we believe that the NE coast of the South Island should be considered the type locality, consistent with the nomenclature of the two subspecies C. h. hectori and C. h. maui. The holotype was partially destroyed at Leuven Museum during WWII, while remaining bones, transferred to the national museum in Brussels, possibly in 1964, were lost. Finally, we propose to change the species name to Aotearoa dolphin, to distinguish from the true Hector’s dolphin, the nominate subspecies C. hectori hectori. © 2024 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Catastrophic natural events can have major impacts on marine ecosystems, but effects on mobile predators, such as cetaceans, remain poorly understood. This study investigated whether the coastal distribution patterns of Hector’s dolphins Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori off Kaikōura, New Zealand, changed after the powerful Kaikōura earthquake in November 2016. Dolphin sightings from boat-based surveys conducted before (2013–2016) and after (2016–2020) the earthquake were binned into 18 sectors of 4 km length each. The dolphins’ occurrence across sectors was then compared during pre- and post-earthquake periods using generalised linear models. Areas of high and low occurrence probability were temporally stable for Hector’s dolphins from before to 1.5 yr post-quake. Historic sighting data (from the 1990s) matched with the observed high-occurrence areas, indicating decadal stability in distribution patterns. An increase in dolphin occurrence was noted in the final 2–4 yr post-quake period across most nearshore sectors. This was particularly noticeable in the historically low-use areas along the narrow shelf at the head of the deep Kaikōura Canyon. This observation could indicate increased population connectivity between dolphins using the northern and southern sections of the Kaikōura Peninsula. The dolphins’ occurrence patterns pre-quake at the sector level were broadly explained by water depth, distance to rivers, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll when explored with generalised additive models. We discuss scenarios that may explain the species’ persistent distribution patterns during natural perturbation events as well as synergies with other conservation measures. © Inter-Research 2024.

ABSTRACT: Stranded animals offer valuable information on marine mammal physiology and pathology; however, the decomposition state of the carcasses and lack of a rigorous cold chain for sample preservation can sometimes discourage diagnostic analyses based on nucleic acid detection. The present paper aims at evaluating the reliability of FTA® card tissue imprints as an alternative matrix to frozen tissues for virological analyses based on biomolecular methods. Given the contribution of Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) to strandings and the increase of herpesvirus detection in cetaceans, these two pathogens were selected as representative of RNA and DNA viruses. Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and herpesvirus presence was investigated in parallel on tissue imprints on FTA® cards and frozen tissues collected during necropsy of dolphins stranded in Italy. Samples were analysed by nested RT-PCR for DMV and nested-PCR for herpesvirus. Only one animal was positive for herpesvirus, hampering further considerations on this virus. DMV was detected in all animals, both in FTA® card imprints and tissue samples, with differences possibly related to the decomposition condition category of the carcasses. Tissue sampling on FTA® cards seems a promising alternative to frozen tissues for biomolecular analyses, especially when ensuring adequate storage and shipment conditions for frozen tissues is difficult. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Guiana dolphins in the Costa Verde estuarine complex of southeastern Brazil are relatively well-studied, but there is still limited knowledge about their movement patterns between the two management units in the region. This study was based on the identification of the individual dolphins that transited between the two Costa Verde management units. Dolphins were photo-identified within the study area from 1994 to 2020, and two photo-identification catalogs were compiled based on this material. These catalogs were systematically compared on the finFindR software, which found 80 individuals that had transited between both management units, between 904 in Sepetiba bay and 808 in Ilha Grande Bay. The most common type of movement was a one-way (no return) movement from Sepetiba to Ilha Grande bay (62.5 %). © 2024 The authors.

ABSTRACT: Accurate whistle contour extraction is crucial in many dolphin behavioural studies. Traditionally, whistle contour extraction involves a first step of finding whistle candidates by peak-level detection in the time-frequency domain, followed by a determination of when peaks are close enough to each other to be part of the same whistle contour. In complex scenarios, such as those with a large number of individuals vocalising simultaneously or those with a sudden increase in background noise, peak-level detection may not provide a number of accurate whistle candidates that is large enough to extract the whistle contour or to disambiguate individual whistles when they cross one another. In these adverse scenarios, a different approach, based on the pyknogram representation, can produce a more accurate detection of whistle candidates and evenly distributed candidates throughout the duration of the whistle. This work compares the peak-level extraction approach of the spectrogram with the point-density extraction approach of the pyknogram. We propose a technique that combines estimates of the central frequency and bandwidth to extract whistle candidates in adverse scenarios. The method has been successfully used for the vocalisation extraction of dolphins in the Bay of Biscay (Spain) using a database of more than 2000 dolphin whistles. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Research on social structure and residency provides important information on the dynamics of a population, improving knowledge of the species' behaviour and ecology. This study investigated the social network, site fidelity, and residency patterns of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) off Lampedusa Island. Direct visual detection and photo-identification methods were used to collect data during 124 boat-based surveys conducted from 2013 to 2020. A total of 117 groups (mean size 4.5 ± 3.3) were sighted; 73 well-marked animals were identified, of which 59% were resighted over the years. The estimate of social differentiation was 0.72 (SE = 0.07), suggesting differentiated social groups within the community. Data were somewhat representative of the true social system, as the correlation coefficient was close to 0.4. However, the half-weight index averaged 0.07 (±0.03), indicating individuals' low tendency to associate. Five social clusters were identified with strong relationships between individuals within each cluster, in which 94% of maximum association indices were ≥0.4. The data also highlighted preferred and avoided associations and stable relationships. The removal of individuals with the highest values of strength and eigenvector centrality from the network did not affect its connectivity, suggesting inherent robustness. Despite the different levels of site fidelity among individuals, the results indicated rather high levels of yearly sighting rate. Temporary migration into and out of the area shown by this study indicates that Lampedusa coastal waters are an important, regularly used bottlenose dolphin habitat. These results suggest extensive ranging behaviour, which implies the need for networking between institutions and organizations from the various states bordering the Strait of Sicily to address conservation efforts and inform regional management of the Mediterranean bottlenose dolphin population. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Marine organisms continually adapt their physiology and behaviour to temporal variations in their environment, resulting in diurnal rhythmic behaviour, particularly when foraging. In delphinids, these rhythms can be studied by recording echolocation clicks, which can provide indicators of foraging activity. The foraging rhythms of delphinids and their relationship to temporal parameters are poorly documented and most studies so far have used moored passive acoustic systems. The present study provides, for the first time, information on the activity rhythms of delphinids investigated in relation with temporal variables at a basin scale from a moving platform, in the western and central Mediterranean Sea. We used passive acoustic recordings collected by hydrophones towed along transect lines during the ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative in the summer 2018. We extracted variables that may influence daily and monthly rhythms, including time of day, lunar cycle, lunar illumination and sea state and fitted generalised additive models. The nycthemeral and lunar cycles were the two main factors influencing dolphin activity rhythms. Echolocation activity was predominant at night, with a maximum of 0.026 acoustic events per minute at 21:00/22:00 compared to as few as 0.0007 events per minute at 11:00. These events were also more frequent during the third quarter of the moon; 0.033 acoustic events on day 22 of the lunar cycle as opposed to 0.0008 on day 8 of the lunar cycle, corresponding to the first quarter of the moon. Variations in the echolocation activity of delphinids in the Mediterranean Sea could reflect variation in their foraging effort and be related to prey density, composition, accessibility and catchability within dolphin foraging depth range. These results should also improve interpretation of passive acoustic monitoring data. Copyright © 2024 Sol, Ollier, Boisseau, Ridoux and Virgili.

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphin is found in the coastal and estuarine areas of West Penang, Malaysia. Studies were conducted to estimate the site fidelity, residence index, and population size of Irrawaddy dolphins in West Penang. Photo-identification studies were conducted using boat surveys from 2019 to 2021. Thirty-nine marked Irrawaddy dolphins were identified, with thirty-six newly identified individuals and three individuals observed in 2013. Resightings of four individuals indicated that they were found north of Sungai Burung and Sungai Pinang in West Penang. The majority of individuals had low sighting rates, ranging from 2.6 to 7.7%, with three individuals having medium sighting rates, the highest being 15.4%. The residence index was 0.01 for all 36 individuals, and the highest value of 0.36 was recorded for one individual. Using open population models and closed models, the population size was determined to be 64 or and 52, respectively. The results suggest that although there is a population present, it is probably open, as the residence index is low. The population size appeared to be stable from 2013 to 2021. This information will inform conservation managers of the best way forward for the conservation of Irrawaddy dolphins in Penang. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A juvenile rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) was live-stranded and rescued in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. From the results of diagnostic examinations, blood tests indicated that the dolphin was malnourished, dehydrated, and anemic. The dolphin died on sixth day of rescue despite treatment. At autopsy, 570 g of foreign material, including 34 pieces of cellophanes and plastic debris (PD), were found in the forestomach. Additional gross findings, including some endoparasitism and presence of accessory spleens were also identified. This is the first case in Japan which accidental ingestion of foreign bodies, including PD, was suspected to be the cause of death in a cetacean. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Although toothed whales have dentition peculiar to mammals, little attention has been paid to the periodontal tissues that support these characteristic teeth. In this study, we clarified the anatomical characteristics of the periodontal tissue in several species of Delphinidae through three-dimensional observation using micro-computed tomography, histological observations using decalcified sections, and immunohistochemical analysis. The results indicated that the teeth and the periodontal tissues of dolphins are morphologically unique among mammals. The alveolar bone was both crude and spongy. The lamina dura, a radiopaque line observed in the alveolar bone of common mammals, was thin in dolphins, and the teeth were attached to the trabeculae with the periodontal ligament (PDL). The alveolar sockets were massive for the size of the teeth. The PDL, a collagen fiber that fills the periodontal space, was well-developed and peculiarly divided into two layers. The inner layer fibers radially spread out from the cementum, similar to the PDL in common mammals. However, the outer layer fibers penetrate the spongy bone in a complicated manner. The interstitial space between the inner and outer layers contained nerve fiber bundles that were thicker than those found in the PDL of other mammals. Sensory receptor-like structures were observed at the terminal ends of the nerve fibers. These findings indicated that the dolphin PDL is more sensitive to dental stimuli than those of other mammals, suggesting that the dolphin dentition plays a functional role as a sensory receptor, similar to tactile hair. © 2024 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) includes highly polymorphic genes involved in antigen presentation, which is crucial for adaptive immune response. They represent fitness related genetic markers particularly informative for populations exposed to environmental challenges. Here we analyse the diversity and evolutionary traits of MHC class II DQA and DQB genes in the dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba and Grampus griseus from the Mediterranean Sea. We found substantial nucleotide and functional diversity, as well as strong evidence of balancing selection indicated by allele and supertype frequencies, Tajima's D statistics and dN/dS tests. The Risso's dolphin, considered the least abundant in the region, showed the effect of divergent allele advantage at the nucleotide and functional-peptide levels. An outstanding polymorphism was found in the striped dolphin, particularly intriguing in the DQA gene where the Ewens-Watterson test detected a selection sweep that occurred in recent history. We hypothesize that morbillivirus, which has recurrently invaded Mediterranean populations over the last decades, exerted the detected selective pressure. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris Gray, 1866) can be found in diverse aquatic environments, ranging from coastal to brackish water, stretching from the West of Bengal in India to the central part of the Indonesian archipelago. Despite its widespread distribution and flexible habitat tolerance, Irrawaddy dolphins in Songkhla Lake, Southern Thailand, are hypothesized to be isolated and exhibit concerningly low population numbers, threatening their long-term survival. Limited knowledge exists regarding their population genetics status. This study analyzed 30 samples from Songkhla Lake (SKL) and the Lower Gulf of Thailand (LGT) to assess their genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity using 16 microsatellite loci. Extremely low genetic diversity was observed in SKL (Ho = 0.039±0.039; AR = 1.122±0.489) and LGT (Ho = 0.033±0.033; AR = 1.141±0.566) populations. Population differentiation (FST = 0.033, p>0.05) and clustering analyses based on both Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) suggest limited genetic divergence and potential panmixia (single genetic pool) between both populations. These findings highlight critical conservation concerns due to low diversity despite the lack of isolation, emphasizing the need for immediate and targeted efforts to ensure the long-term viability of this iconic yet vulnerable population. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic properties of the underwater environment are important in maintaining biological processes of various marine organisms. However, with the increasing level of underwater noise in the global ocean, there is a growing need to better understand how marine animals use soundscape cues in their habitat selection. Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) inhabiting the Pearl River Estuary, southeast China, live in one of world's most developed and noisiest coastal environment and are subjected to many sources of anthropogenic noise. To investigate whether spatial variability of underwater soundscape corresponds with their habitat utilization, we collected daytime underwater recordings in western Hong Kong waters from mid-2016 to mid-2018, and quantified the spatial pattern of marine acoustic environment and its differing characteristics in a fine spatial scale. We developed a framework of soundscape information retrieval to investigate spectral features that may facilitate identification of dolphins’ core habitats. Our findings reveal that a spectral feature, which peaks at 2 kHz, is a reliable predictor of humpback dolphin core habitat. Further modelling of spatial and seasonal variations of underwater soundscape demonstrates that the relative strength of this spectral feature is positively correlated with the sighting rates of humpback dolphins throughout the year. Although the source of the 2 kHz feature remains unknown, it is likely associated with humpback dolphins’ prey. We suggest that underwater acoustic environment represents an important component in evaluating the quality and suitability of coastal habitats for the daily needs of this threatened dolphin species. Local and regional conservation authorities should include habitat-specific baseline soundscape data when developing conservation management strategies. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The emergence of Brucella infections in marine mammals is a growing concern. The present study reports two cases of systemic Brucella pinnipedialis infection detected in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) pair stranded together in the Cantabrian coast of Spain. Both animals showed systemic lesions associated with the Brucella infection, more severe in the younger dolphin, considered the likely offspring of the other individual. Real-time PCR, bacterial culture, and whole-genome sequencing were used to detect and characterize the Brucella strains involved in both dolphins. The phylogenetic analysis performed on the Brucella genomes retrieved revealed that the species involved was B. pinnipedialis (ST25). Both animals resulted seropositive in a commercial multispecies blocking ELISA but tested negative in the standard Rose Bengal test. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a systemic infection resulting in various lesions associated with Brucella pinnipedialis (ST25) in two bottlenose dolphins. It is also the initial isolation of Brucella in the milk of a non-pregnant or non-aborting female cetacean likely stranded with its offspring. These findings provide new insights into the epidemiology and clinical impact of B. pinnipedialis infection in cetaceans and underscore the importance of continued diagnostic surveillance to gain better understanding of brucellosis effects and transmission in marine mammal populations. IMPORTANCE Brucella spp. are zoonotic pathogens that can affect both terrestrial and marine mammals. Brucella ceti has been identified in various cetacean species, but only one sequence type (ST27) has been reported in humans. However, it is important to conduct surveillance studies to better understand the impact of marine Brucella species on marine mammals, a typically understudied host group. Here, we describe a systemic infection by two related strains of Brucella pinnipedialis (ST25) in a couple of live-stranded bottlenose dolphins, with more severe lesions in the younger animal. Furthermore, B. pinnipedialis was first detected in milk from a female cetacean that stranded with its offspring. Our study reveals novel insights into the epidemiology and pathological consequences of B. pinnipedialis infections in cetaceans, emphasizing the crucial importance of ongoing surveillance and accurate diagnosis to understand the impact of this pathogen on marine mammal populations.

ABSTRACT: Climate change, overfishing, and other anthropogenic activities can negatively impact the energetic balance and body condition of cetaceans. Still, cetaceans must meet their energetic demands for survival, which are more expensive to maintain in the marine environment. The resilience of cetaceans to negative energy balance periods is unknown. We analyzed where striped dolphins, a medium-sized dolphin with shallow-intermediate diving habits, and Blainville's beaked whales, a larger odontocete with an extreme diving profile, store their energy reserves and how they use that energy. We performed dissections of body mass compartments of fresh dead adults of similar total body lengths but different body masses, determined the lipid and protein content of blubber and muscle, and calculated oxygen stores and the aerobic dive limit. Proteins in muscle were the largest source of energy stores for both species, followed by lipids in the blubber and muscle. Both species catabolized blubber and muscle simultaneously when losing body mass to avoid impairing other important functions. When these functions are impaired, a cascade of increased field metabolic rate and decreased energy intake may occur, decreasing their resilience to environmental challenges and making them more susceptible to diseases, ultimately resulting in death by starvation. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The bottlenose dolphin is a widely distributed species found in temperate waters, including the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The Black Sea population is recognized as a distinct subspecies, Tursiops truncatus ponticus, due to genetic and morphological differences. This study analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of 73 bottlenose dolphin samples collected between 1999 and 2016 along the Turkish Black Sea coast, Turkish Straits System (TSS), Aegean, and Mediterranean Seas revealing 14 haplotypes, eight of which are reported here for the first time. The haplotype network shows two main nodes with star-like sub-networks, but no apparent geographic pattern. The lack of geographical groupings of haplotypes indicates the high mobility of the species within the sampled area. The northern Black Sea bottlenose dolphins (NBS) appear to be genetically differentiated from those in the southwestern Black Sea (SBS), Mediterranean, and Atlantic Ocean, but not from the TSS and Aegean Sea populations. Besides, SBS bottlenose dolphins were differentiated only from those in the western Mediterranean (WM) and the Atlantic. Therefore, NBS and SBS bottlenose dolphins should at least be categorized as different populations. However, contrary to some previous studies there was no evidence supporting the classification of Black Sea bottlenose dolphins as a separate subspecies. The TSS differs only from the Atlantic and the Aegean, and functions like a migratory ‘melting pot’ for surrounding populations. Despite the largest sample size, NBS bottlenose dolphins exhibited the lowest haplotype and nucleotide diversity. This low genetic diversity and potential isolation from adjacent populations highlight the need for prioritizing the conservation of NBS bottlenose dolphins. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The acoustic ecology of a previously unexamined dolphin population in the Mediterranean was assessed by investigating how sound emissions and acoustic features are influenced by concurrent conditions. Whistles and click-trains emission rates were compared among different environmental, social and behavioural conditions. Structural variability of 3928 good/high-quality vocalizations was analysed in relation to contexts through a two-stage approach. First, two multivariate MANOVA-models were fitted considering the entire set of acoustic parameters extracted from whistles and click trains, to investigate the effect of concomitant factors on the overall acoustic structure of each vocalization. Subsequently, GLMM models were applied to each acoustic feature individually to explore its response to different contextual factors. Emission rates increased significantly with calves and in larger groups, with also a positive effect of socialization on whistles and of muddy/sandy seabed and depth on impulsive sounds. The multivariate approach showed that all contextual factors influenced sounds’ structure, with whistles being strongly affected by behaviour and calves’ presence. The GLMM models highlighted that each acoustic parameter varied differently in response to specific factors, with (1) increasing trends in whistles’ duration and inflection points during interaction with fishery and decreasing ones during socializing, and (2) decreasing inter-click-intervals and increasing click-repetition-rates in larger groups and during interactions with fishery. These results provide new findings on the acoustic plasticity of bottlenose dolphins and a more comprehensive view of the magnitude of the social, environmental and behavioural influence, highlighting how the complexity of the species’ acoustic repertoire has yet to be unravelled at the local level. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Contamination by metals poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems and the health of marine organisms, including cetaceans. This study aimed to assess the concentrations of some metal and metalloids in the skin of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico using Flame Atomic Absorption (FAA) spectrometry. A total of 41 skin samples were collected, comprising 22 samples from Yucatán in the Gulf of Mexico and 19 samples from Chetumal Bay in the Caribbean. The results of our analysis revealed the presence of various elements in the skin of bottlenose dolphins from coastal waters in the Yucatan Peninsula. Among the detected metals, zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and arsenic (As) exhibited notable concentrations, with the order of abundance being Zn > Fe > As > Cu > Cr > Cd > Ni. The elevated concentrations of Zn and Fe suggest potential exposure and accumulation of these metals in the studied dolphin population. Interestingly, measurable concentrations of lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn) were not detected in the skin samples, indicating either low levels or the absence of their accumulation in the studied dolphin populations. The absence of measurable Pb concentrations is particularly encouraging as Pb is known to have detrimental effects on marine organisms and is commonly associated with anthropogenic activities. This study provides valuable insights into the metal contamination status in bottlenose dolphins from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The notable concentrations of Zn, Fe, and As raise concerns about potential health risks to these charismatic marine mammals. Further research is warranted to investigate the sources and pathways of heavy metal exposure in this population and to understand the potential consequences of such exposure on the health and well-being of bottlenose dolphins in the Yucatan Peninsula. © (2024), (European Association for Aquatic Mammals).

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Use of mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia is a necessary practice in the anesthetization of small cetaceans as spontaneous ventilation fails to provide adequate gas exchange. Currently available methods of ventilation do not account for the intermittent breathing strategy of representative species within this infraorder of fully aquatic mammals and may have a significant effect on cardiac and respiratory physiology. Methods: To understand the impact of mechanical ventilation on cardiopulmonary function in one small species of cetacean, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), we compared controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) to a novel ventilation method known as apneustic anesthesia ventilation (AAV). AAV simulates the normal inspiratory breath-hold pattern of dolphins. Ten anesthetic procedures (dental procedure, n = 9; bronchoscopy, n = 2) were performed on nine dolphins (age range: 10–42 years; mean = 32 years; median = 37 years; female = 3, 40%; male = 6, 60%). In a cross-over study design, dolphins were instrumented and randomly assigned to AAV or CMV as the initial mode of ventilation, then switched to the alternate mode. Baseline cardiopulmonary data were collected and again after 30 min on each mode of ventilation. Cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic vascular resistance, alveolar dead space, alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient, arterial oxygen content, oxygen delivery index, and dynamic respiratory system compliance index were calculated at each of the four time points. Results: During AAV, dolphins had higher arterial oxygen tension, higher mean airway pressure, reduced alveolar dead space ventilation and lower alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Cardiovascular performance was not statistically different between the two modes. Discussion: Our study suggests AAV, which more closely resembles the conscious intermittent respiratory pattern phenotype of dolphins, improves ventilation and pulmonary function in the anesthetized dolphin. Future studies should evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects of neutral buoyancy and cardiopulmonary sparing drug protocols to reduce the need for hemodynamic support of current protocols.

ABSTRACT: The Pacific region is experiencing accelerating global change with complex interactions amongst multiple drivers, yet the onus for urgent adaptation falls largely on communities. Proponents of adaptation must therefore ensure that communities are empowered and enabled to design and implement their own adaptation plans after project cycles have concluded, and that this capacity is scaled beyond the original focus. To address this challenge, we tested a new approach in the Solomon Islands for the iterative development, implementation and evaluation of community-led adaptation. Our theory of change was that by co-designing a decision-making process with a network of community facilitators, livelihood adaptation planning could be mainstreamed and scaled out across rural communities. We implemented a planning process based on systems thinking, social learning and co-production, which we assessed using a novel participatory monitoring, evaluation and learning framework. The process involved six steps: (1) identifying drivers of change; (2) developing shared visions for livelihoods; (3) scoping possible futures for livelihoods; (4) identifying existing community adaptive capacity; (5) determining priority ‘no-regrets’ strategies to achieve the community vision and (6) mapping adaptation pathways of implementation decisions. Community facilitators co-designed the process, and then ran it in their communities to develop place-based adaptation pathways suited to the local decision-making context, and scaling the process out to neighbouring villages through peer-to-peer learning. Results from a monitoring, evaluation and learning assessment showed the process had generated shifts in thinking among communities towards anticipatory adaptation and the development and implementation of livelihood adaptation pathways. The process had also empowered people to have ownership, responsibility and agency for their futures without major ongoing support from outside agencies. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding species' critical habitat requirements is crucial for effective conservation and management. However, such information can be challenging to obtain, particularly for highly mobile, wide-ranging species such as cetaceans. In the absence of systematic surveys, alternative economically viable methods are needed, such as the use of data collected from platforms of opportunity, and modelling techniques to predict species distribution in un-surveyed areas. The present study used data collected by ecotourism and other vessels of opportunity to investigate important habitats of a small, poorly studied population of bottlenose dolphins in Port Phillip Bay, south-eastern Australia. Using 16 years of dolphin sighting location data, an ensemble habitat suitability model was built from which physical factors influencing dolphin distribution were identified. Results indicated that important habitats were those areas close to shipping channels and coastlines with these factors primarily influencing the variation in the likelihood of dolphin presence. The relatively good performance of the ensemble model suggests that simple presence-background data may be sufficient for predicting the species distribution where sighting data are limited. However, additional data from the center of Port Phillip Bay is required to further support this contention. Important habitat features identified in the study are likely to relate to favorable foraging conditions for dolphins as they are known to provide feeding, breeding, and spawning habitat for a diverse range of fish and cephalopod prey species. The results of the present study highlight the importance of affordable community-based data collection, such as ecotourism vessels, for obtaining information critical for effective management.

ABSTRACT: Assessing trends in population abundance and demographics is crucial for managing long-lived and slow-reproducing species. Obtaining demographic data, and age-structure information, is challenging, notably for cetaceans. To address this, we combined Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS; drone) photogrammetry data with long-term (>20 years) photo identification data to assess the age-structure of the critically endangered sub-population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) of the Gulf of Ambracia, Greece. We compared our findings with two extensively studied non-endangered bottlenose dolphin populations (T. aduncus in Shark Bay, Australia, and T. truncatus in Sarasota Bay, USA). Using a log-linear model, we estimated the total body lengths (TL) of 160 known-aged dolphins between 2021 and 2023 from blowhole-to-dorsal-fin distance (BHDF) measurements collected during surfacing. Subsequently, we tested four growth models to establish an age-length growth curve. We assessed the sub-population's age-structure using three methods: (1) UAS-derived TL estimates, (2) age-length growth curve and (3) long-term monitoring data (i.e. actual age-structure). UAS-measured TL (247.6 ± 32.2 cm) and UAS-estimated TL (246.0 ± 34.7 cm) of the Greek sub-population showed no differences. The Richards Growth model suggested an asymptotic length of 258.5 cm. In Greece, resulting age-structure estimates across the three methods revealed no significant differences (P > 0.1). The Gulf of Ambracia and Shark Bay populations shared similar age-structures, while Sarasota had higher proportions of 2–10 year-olds and lower proportions of 10+ year-olds. All populations had a comparable proportion of 0–2 year-olds (~14%), indicating a similar reproductive rate. Our findings suggest stability in the Greek sub-population; however, additional monitoring of reproductive parameters is essential before concluding its status. We demonstrated the effectiveness of UAS-photogrammetry in rapidly quantifying population age-structure, including scenarios with limited or no demographic data. This technique shows promise for enhancing precision, timeliness, cost-effectiveness and efficiency in population monitoring and informing timely conservation management decisions. © 2024 Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The article studies the bottlenose dolphin community in coastal waters of the Karadag Reserve (southeastern Crimea). Observations and acoustic recordings were carried out in 2015–2017 and 2020–2022. To identify bottlenose dolphins, we mainly used the method developed by us for acoustic recording of bottlenose dolphins by individual sound signals: signature whistles. This identification method makes it possible to fairly accurately count the population, observe the movements of bottlenose dolphins, and reveal the relationships between individuals. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In marine ecosystems, predators can affect community and ecosystem dynamics through a variety of processes such as foraging facilitation. Here, we report evidence of foraging facilitation between common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and double-crested cormorants (Nannopterum auritum) in the Caribbean seagrass-dominated atoll of Turneffe, Belize using aerial drone observations conducted in 2015-2017. While dolphins exhibited occasional aggressive behaviours toward the cormorants, the latter frequently followed dolphin movements, suggesting opportunistic pursuit of dolphins for prey access during dolphin bottom foraging activity. Our observations underscore the intricate ecological relationships among marine predators and highlight the need to quantify the mutual benefits and costs of such interactions as coastal ecosystems are rapidly changing. © ERIC A.

ABSTRACT: Information on marine mammal habitat use in coastal areas can provide a better understanding of anthropogenic effects on species. Admiralty Bay, New Zealand has extensive near-shore mussel farms and is an important dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) foraging habitat. Prior dusky dolphin research indicated a declining trend in regional abundance from the late 1990s to mid-2000s. We describe dusky dolphin behaviour, habitat patch use and movement patterns in Admiralty Bay in 2011–2012 and compare findings to previous research to capture long-term trends. Sampling methods included small-boat group follows and photo-identification and shore-based theodolite tracking. Dolphin encounter rate, mean group size, and individual resighting rate showed a negative trend from previous years. Coordinated prey ball herding, a foraging technique documented in previous years, was rarely observed during this study. Dolphins were more likely to forage near farms (excluding specialised prey herding), though they seldom entered farms. Near shore, swimming speed was slower, reorientation rate was higher, and linearity was lower in the presence of farms than in their absence. This research builds upon prior studies, suggesting a continued decline in dusky dolphin presence, and highlights differences in habitat patch use in a human-altered ecosystem. © 2024 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Evaluation of temporal patterns in offshore marine mammal activity through visual data collection can be impaired by light and weather conditions and the cost of ship time. The conditions-independence and cost-efficacy of acoustic data collection make it popular for researching the temporal patterns of wild dolphins. However, Pacific white-sided dolphins (PWSDs) north of Southern California remain under-researched. This study evaluates diel and seasonal patterns in PWSD communication signals detected in 480 days of near-continuous passive acoustic data collected over 20 months from the Barkley Canyon node of Ocean Networks Canada's NEPTUNE observatory, offshore Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. In this study, a random forest classifier is used to identify PWSD pulsed calls and false positives are manually removed. The resulting acoustic presence-absence data set is evaluated for seasonal and diel patterns using generalized additive mixed models, considering masking effects from ambient noise. PWSDs are found to be vocally active during all diel periods year-round, with high summer and low spring activity. Seasonally dependent diel patterns are identified, with PWSD pulsed calls exhibiting no diel pattern in spring, a slight increase in vocal activity during dusk and night in fall and winter, and a notable increase during night and dawn in summer. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Hector’s dolphin, an endangered species endemic to the coastal waters of Aotearoa New Zealand, has a highly fragmented population structure. Low abundance of some local subpopulations, coupled with a stepping-stone mode of gene flow, suggests that these are at high risk of extinction. During the austral summer, dolphins from the small, genetically distinct subpopulation found along the South Island’s south-east coast frequently use Porpoise Bay, an important foraging and calving area. The estimate of abundance of dolphins using the bay has not been updated since the introduction of protection measures in 2008 intended to mitigate bycatch in fisheries. Photo-ID surveys, including random photography to estimate mark rate, were conducted during summer 2020. Using Chapman’s version of the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, it was estimated that 63 Hector’s dolphins (95% CI = 46–79), including three new calves, used Porpoise Bay during the study period. While regression analyses showed no evidence of change since previous abundance estimates in 1996–97, 2002–03, and 2008, the very low estimated abundance validates fears for the long-term persistence of this subpopulation. In this context, potential threats need to be managed within a precautionary framework, with a clear goal of facilitating recovery. © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Some dolphin species produce signature whistles, which may allow the identification of individual dolphins using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Identifying individuals by their sounds may enhance the opportunities for monitoring and addressing biological and ecological questions about these species. Here, we explored the potential of signature whistles to investigate ecological aspects of a resident bottlenose dolphin population. Using a limited data set, with few individuals recognized by signature whistles, combined with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, we investigated how effective such approach is describing spatial use patterns and estimating density for this population. The data were collected using 4–6 stationary bottom-moored recorders. Since only eight signature whistles were identified, our density estimate may represent a subset of the entire population. However, even with only a few signature whistles identified, our results confirmed the center of the core area used by these dolphins as the area with the highest encounter probability. In addition, our results provided evidence that these dolphins have the same spatial use pattern at night as during the day. This study shows that SCR analysis of signature whistle data can improve our ecological knowledge and understanding of dolphin populations. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment is an essential component of the management policies used by zoos and aquaria to promote animals’ welfare. However, when enrichments are provided several times, they can cause habituation and lose their enrichment effects. A simple method to avoid it could be making a preventive assessment about the trend of animals’ interest in a stimulus provided several times. Here, we hypothesized that anticipatory behavior could be used to assess the decrease in interest in playing with objects when the activity is repeated. Moreover, we also assumed that this could be done before providing objects to play with. Our results support this hypothesis. Specifically, we found a positive correlation between the time the 7 dolphins tested spent performing anticipatory behavior before the enrichment sessions and the time they spent playing with objects during those sessions. As a result, anticipatory behavior performed before enrichment sessions predicted dolphins’ interest in the session and allowed us to assess whether the sessions had lost their enrichment effect. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Solitary dolphins occurring outside their normal range provide a unique opportunity to study acoustic signals in the complete absence of conspecifics, drawing insights into their communicative functions. In this study, we analysed the acoustic behaviour of a solitary bottlenose dolphin residing in the Baltic Sea. We expected that he would produce few, if any, communicative sounds in the absence of potential recipients. Contrary to this expectation, we found the dolphin to be highly vocal, emitting burst-pulse and tonal sounds in rhythmic bouts. The sounds did not co-occur with echolocation trains, indicating that they were not produced during feeding activities, despite the presence of bray calls previously identified as feeding-associated in this population. The dolphin produced three different types of stereotyped whistles, deviating from the typical pattern of one individually distinctive signature whistle per dolphin. Additionally, three different biphonic sound categories were identified: combinations of two whistle components, a whistle and a low-frequency tonal component, and two burst-pulse components. In conclusion, the production of vocalisations in the absence of conspecifics suggests that these sounds may be emitted unintentionally as emotional signals, serve functions other than direct communication, or simply be a byproduct of dolphins’ intrinsic need for social interaction. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small double-stranded DNA viruses able to infect species across all vertebrate taxa. In cetaceans, PyVs have been reported only in short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and killer whale (Orcinus orca). Herein, we surveyed PyV in 119 cetaceans (29 mysticetes and 90 odontocetes) stranded along the Brazilian coast, from 2002 to 2022, comprising 18 species. DNA extracted from the lungs was tested using a nested PCR targeting the major capsid protein gene of PyV. Polyomavirus was detected in lung samples of 1.7% (2/119) cetaceans: two juvenile female Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) stranded in Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro state) and Guriri (Espírito Santo state), in 2018. Both retrieved sequences were identical and presented 93.3% amino acid identity with Zetapolyomavirus delphini, suggesting a novel species. On histopathology, one of the PyV-positive individuals presented basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies morphologically consistent with polyomavirus in the lungs. Other available tissues from both cases were PyV-PCR-negative; however, both individuals tested positive for Guiana dolphin morbillivirus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PyV infection in cetaceans of the Southern Hemisphere and the first description of a co-infection with morbillivirus. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Different Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age sites located in the Ras al-Hadd cape and Ras al-Jinz Bay area (Ash-Sharqiyyah South Governorate, Sultanate of Oman) have provided thousands of zooarchaeological dolphin remains suggesting a strong reliance on the exploitation of these animals. Dolphins are hard to identify to the species level due to a highly comparable interspecies osteological morphology as well as a general lack of extensive osteological reference collections. As a result, such remains are frequently identified as “dolphin”, without any further species identification being undertaken. In this study, we assess whether an osteometric method for distinguishing the nine dolphin species that are present in Omani waters can be used to identify the zooarchaeological specimens. Zooarchaeology by Mass-Spectrometry (ZooMS) was also undertaken on a subset of the specimens but proved ineffective due to the poor preservation of the material in an arid climate. This evidence strengthens the need for effective species identification methods based on traditional zooarchaeological methods. This research is based on our ongoing analysis of the thousands of dolphin remains from the Omani zooarchaeological assemblages. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are independent systems, where mobile hubs com-municate with different hubs through wireless connections by multi-hop transmission. Security is as yet an issue to be fixed in MANETs. The congestion is the factor which affects the quality of service in the system. In MANET, obstacle happens to owe to the loss of packet, which could be adequately limited by proposed efficient congestion control approach. In the existing method, the dolphin Glow worm optimisation is applied with AES to improve the security of the system. The drawback in DGWO is that the load balancing of the network is not considered for routing. Load balancing is also an important concept to prolong the network lifetime. These issues are overcome by proposed Satin bower bird and dolphin glow worm optimisation for routing with efficient congestion control approach. The satin bower bird algorithm is used to perform the energy and distance-based cell zooming concept in the MANET. The optimal route is selected based on optimising the energy-efficient of the network using the Glow worm optimisation algorithm. The proposed (SBO-DGWO) is able to achieve high energy efficiency of the network with traffic congestion control. The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of the existing method effectively by load balancing and optimal route selection to prolong the lifetime of the network. This proposed method is compared with the existing optimisation strategies such as Trust-based dolphin glow worm optimisation. The proposed approach is implemented in network simulator version 2 and results are analysed in terms of through-put, packet loss, delay, and load. It is analysed that network throughput is increased, packet-loss, delay, and load are reduced in the proposed methodology as compared to state-of-art. The proposed method is able to reduce the routing overhead as 0.285 kbps due to the load balancing based on the distance and residual energy of the node using satin bowerbird algorithm. The network lifetime is increased due to the reduction of energy consumption of the nodes using energy efficient routing in the Dolphin glow worm optimisation. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd..

ABSTRACT: We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency (fR), respiratory flow, and end-expired gases in rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) housed in managed care after an overnight fast and 1–2 hr following a meal. The measured average (± standard deviation) VT (4.0 ± 1.3 L) and fR (1.9 ± 1.0 breaths/min) were higher and lower, respectively, as compared with estimated values from both terrestrial and aquatic mammals, and the average VT was 43% of the estimated total lung capacity. The end-expired gas levels suggested that this species keep alveolar O2 (10.6% or 80 mmHg) and CO2 (7.6% or 57 mmHg), and likely arterial gas tensions, low and high, respectively, to maximize efficiency of gas exchange. We show that following an overnight fast, the RMR (566 ± 158 ml O2/min) was 1.8 times the estimated value predicted by Kleiber for terrestrial mammals of the same size. We also show that between 1 and 2 hr after ingestion of a meal, the metabolic rate increases an average of 29% (709 ± 126 ml O2/min). Both body mass (Mb) and fR significantly altered the measured RMR and we propose that both these variables should be measured when estimating energy use in cetaceans. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Analyses of the cetacean (whale and dolphin) inner ear provide glimpses into the ecology and evolution of extinct and extant groups. The paleoecology of the long-snouted odontocete (toothed whale) group, Parapontoporia, is primarily marine with its depositional context also suggesting freshwater tolerance. As an extinct relative of the exclusively riverine Lipotes vexillifer, Parapontoporia provides insight into a transition from marine to freshwater environments. High-resolution X-ray CT scans (~3 microns or less) of three individual specimens from two species, P. sternbergi and P. pacifica, were acquired. Digital endocasts of the inner ear labyrinths were extracted non-destructively. Nine measurements of the inner ear were compared with an existing dataset covering 125 terrestrial and aquatic artiodactyls. These measurements were then subjected to a principal component analysis to interpret hearing sensitivities among other artiodactyls. Based on our analyses, Parapontoporia was likely to have been able to hear within narrow-band high frequency (NBHF) ranges. This finding indicates another convergence of NBHF-style hearing, or, more intriguingly, suggests that it may be an ancestral characteristic present among the longirostrine dolphins that dominated in the Miocene prior to the evolution of more modern lineages. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Live-strandings of cetaceans are uncommon in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. However, an adult female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops trunca-tus) with normal body condition was recorded at Pelicano’s Beach on the coast of Veracruz State. Health assessment showed multiple external injuries, possibly caused by the stranding event, as well as potential bacterial infection, and, thus, the individual was held in temporary facilities for rehabilitation. Blood samples were taken to assess the health status of the individual and were also analyzed for concentrations of 20 pollutants (14 organochlorine pesticides [OCPs] and six heavy metals [HMs]). The animal was released and found dead within a few days. The concentration of OCPs and HMs were close or above the government limits. Although these were lower than those reported in other living, free-ranging bottlenose dolphins, there are well-known negative effects for health. Low OCP values were attributed to an offloading process through lactation or mobility of the lipophilic OCPs that pass from blood to fat. Whereas HM concentrations (mainly non-essential metals: mercury [Hg], lead [Pb], and cadmium [Cd]—2.73, 21.13, and 12.67 pg L-1, respectively) were probably linked to the diet and the possible distribution of the specimen (possibly offshore). This is the first report on pollutants from anthropogenic origin in the area where uncontrolled activities are of major concern within a protected national reef park. Since marine ecosystems are under continuous pressure, several health issues for top predators are being noticed; therefore, this study underlines the relevance of studying health status of marine mammals in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico. © (2024), (European Association for Aquatic Mammals).

ABSTRACT: We report first-time evidence of barrier feeding techniques in the population of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) at the estuary of the Tiber River (Rome, Italy), used to prey on the flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus). We describe an event that occurred in summer 2023, consisting of dolphins forcing schools of mullets against different types of barriers, i.e. sea surface, coastal breakwater blocks and other dolphins. We provide the first visual and acoustic account of this predation modality in the Mediterranean Sea, showing that bottlenose dolphins adopted techniques to fragmentate prey assemblages and then to limit prey escape routes by forcing them against barriers. In this way dolphins were able to catch the mullets both in air and in the water. Such a technique possibly depends on the ability of sensing each other in the hunting group and of exchanging information through different types of vocalizations. © 2024 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

ABSTRACT: The marine waters around the Azores archipelago have been studied for quite a long time. Deeper areas, however, were historically poorly accessible and only now previously unreported species are recorded regularly. Our monitoring efforts of the Azorean ichthyofauna have recently revealed two cases of indirect evidence of the presence of a cookiecutter shark (Isistius sp.). The evidence, documented photographically, was in the form of explicit bite marks on two dolphins representing two separate species: the Atlantic spotted dolphin, Stenella frontalis (Cuvier, 1829) and the short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis Linnaeus, 1758. The two dolphins swam close to Terceira Island. No specimens have yet been collected. The shape, and size of the wounds observed suggest that they were inflicted by a cookiecutter shark. The fresh state of the injuries suggests they were sustained recently in the proximity of the Azores. © Barcelos et al.

ABSTRACT: Since 1989, multiple stranding events of common dolphins have been regularly recorded along the French Atlantic coast. Examination of the carcasses revealed that most animals presented evidence of bycatch. Using stranding data to infer bycatch levels reveals the highest levels of bycatch to have been recorded since 2016 (4000 to 9000 bycaught individuals). This approach is directly influenced by drift conditions, which can greatly contribute to or hinder our ability to estimate bycatch at sea. In the winter of 2021/2022, the French stranding network recorded an unusually high number of strandings until mid-February and few records in March. Investigation of drift conditions revealed low probability of stranding in March due to constant east—west winds. Reverse drift modelling of carcasses stranded in January and February resulted in an estimate of 3670 (95% CI [2750; 5170]) bycaught common dolphins. Dedicated aerial surveys were conducted in the same area during this period, designed to assess abundance and distribution of marine megafauna in French waters. A high number of carcasses of small Delphininae were observed in March 2021, and the number of carcasses floating at sea could be estimated using conventional distance sampling methodology. In March 2021, mortality at sea was thus estimated at 3250 (95% CI [1288;10198]) common dolphins. The complementary use of both methodologies resulted in an estimate of 6920 (95%CI [4038;15 368]) bycaught individuals during winter 2021/2022. This case study highlights that a decrease in strandings does not imply a decrease in mortality at sea. Trends in strandings need to be considered in the light of scientific evidence to avoid delays in decision making. © The authors 2024. Open Access under Creative Commons by Attribution Licence.

ABSTRACT: Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are a well-known class of pollutants which can bioaccumulate and biomagnify with a vast majority being highly persistent. This study aims to determine the biomagnification rates of PFAS in sexually mature striped dolphins and to assess temporal trends on PFAS concentrations over the past three decades (1990–2021) in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. Thirteen and 17 of the 19 targeted PFAS were detected in the samples of the dolphins’ digestive content and liver, respectively, at concentrations ranging between 43 and 1609 ng/g wet weight, and 254 and 7010 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The most abundant compounds in both types of samples were linear perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (n-PFOS) and perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA), which were present in all samples, followed by perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Long-chain PFAS (i.e., PFCAs C ≥ 7 and PFSAs C ≥ 6) biomagnified to a greater extent than short-chain PFAS, suggesting a potential effect on the health of striped dolphins. Environmental Quality Standards concentrations set in 2014 by the European Union were exceeded in half of the samples of digestive content, suggesting that polluted prey may pose potential health risks for striped dolphins. Concentrations of most long-chain PFAS increased from 1990 to 2004–2009, then stabilized during 2014–2021, possibly following country regulations and industrial initiatives. The current study highlights the persistent presence of banned PFAS and may contribute to future ecological risk assessments and the design of management strategies to mitigate PFAS pollution in marine ecosystems. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: There has been a long debate on whether cetaceans recognize external chemical compounds in water. Genetically, they lost some taste receptors due to their aquatic adaptations. In contrast, neuroanatomical and behavioral studies have suggested that young dolphins can perceive specific chemicals. In this study, we tested whether young dolphins could recognize fatty acids contained in their mother's milk. We performed mRNA sequencing of the tongue of a 1-year-old Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin. Long-chain fatty acid taste receptors were expressed in a V-shaped row of the tongue, which is specific for young dolphins and has taste bud-like structures. The lingual lipase is also expressed in the V-shaped row, which may enhance the release of free fatty acids from triacylglycerols. Notably, the sour taste receptor was nonfunctionalized specifically in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. We comprehensively qualified the fatty acids in the milk of captive common bottlenose dolphins. Seven saturated and 16 unsaturated long-chain fatty acids were detected. Behavioral tests in captive common bottlenose dolphins showed that a juvenile can recognize the presence of milk in water. These results indicated that young dolphins may have functional fat taste receptors in their oral cavity that detect long-chain fatty acids contained in their mother's milk. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: The morphological differentiation between coastal and offshore ecotypes of bottlenose dolphins (genus Tursiops) has been researched since the 1960s, particularly in T. truncatus (Montagu, 1821), although most morphological studies have focused on localized populations. Therefore, it is unclear how patterns observed in these individual populations integrate within the global morphological variation. Here we carry out a meta-analysis of global morphological variation between coastal and offshore ecotypes from 532 museum specimens, using both linear measurements (LM; 282 specimens), and shape data using geometric morphometrics (GM; 290 specimens). Together these analyses show consistent differentiation in skull morphology between coastal and offshore ecotypes, and provide a detailed description of variation patterns within each ecotype. These patterns show high individual morphological variation in the coastal ecotype between locations, while the offshore ecotype appears morphologically more uniform across the areas sampled. Overall, most skull shape variation can be described by features noticeable dorsally in the structures of the rostrum, whereas more limited change was found in ventral traits. Our results suggest that individual coastal populations may vary according to local environmental conditions, while those corresponding to the offshore ecotype appear to share similar morphological characteristics that might increase fitness in offshore habitats. © 2023 Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Cognitive enrichments have gained popularity in the past two decades in both farm animal and zoological settings. In this study, we present a cognitive enrichment device that, for the first time, allowed testing for prosocial food-sharing actions in dolphins. The device was made of a PVC tube and two caps with rope handles; one handle was fixed to the poolside whereas the other was available for the dolphins. Its internal structure kept five fish in place while maintaining a closed status. The dolphin who pulled the rope handle could not access the fish but allowed another individual to access it. Once the handle was released, however, the device closed back. The device was tested with a male and a female group, separately. The males obtained approximately a third, while the females acquired none of the fish using the device. Moreover, the males were observed to open the device more frequently and longer in the presence of their group members and with consistent roles. These results provide the first support of male dolphins’ willingness to engage in food-sharing that could be considered as an altruistic action. It also provides basis for further investigations on more detailed and long-term monitoring of the emergence and consequences of such cooperative actions.

ABSTRACT: Ex-situ research in aquariums and zoological settings not only support scientific advancement, they also provide opportunities for education, facilitating both mental and physical stimulation, consequently improving welfare. This study aimed to investigate the impact of cognitive testing on the well-being of a group of male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. The occurrence of affiliative, aggressive and potentially stereotypical behaviors was assessed based on seven monitored behavior types and compared between “Session days” and “Non-session days.” The consistency of the impact was assessed over a three-year period. The analyses revealed that “Play with enrichment,” “Affiliative tactile,” “Social play” and “Synchronous swim” were significantly higher, while “Aggression” was significantly lower on Session days than on Non-session days. Individual analysis showed significant increase in the positive welfare indicators in all dolphins during Session days. The social network analysis of aggressive interactions between group members also supported an overall decrease of aggression during Session days. These results indicate that dolphin groups that voluntarily participate in cognitive tests under human care benefit from the testing and show an improvement in animal welfare while contributing to scientific advancement. © 2022 Ocean Park Hong Kong.

ABSTRACT: Residency (R) and site fidelity (SF) are important parameters in population ecology, yet their quantification poses challenges in marine mammals. Based on a previous review, this study used simulated and empirical mark-resight data to assess the variations and performance of the most used R (n = 8) and SF (n = 11) indices in peer-reviewed literature under different scenarios. We applied the Jolly-Seber model to simulate thousands of bottlenose dolphin populations varying resighting (p) and survival (Phi) probabilities, and performed calibration, sensitivity, and validation analyses. Our results underscore the effects of p and Phi on individual categorization within the diverse simulated conditions, representing the often-overlooked heterogeneity in residency classification for Tursiops populations. All SF indices showed similar and consistent performance (>0.70 Gower’s distance) across the simulated scenarios, even when compared to field study data from wild dolphin populations (i.e., Savannah, USA, and Alvarado, Mexico); thus, SF should be a critical parameter for interstudy comparisons. Conversely, R indices were remarkably different based on their definitions and classification criteria. The different thresholds among definitions largely biased the proportion of residents and transient individuals (or occasional visitors) even leading to counterintuitive outcomes. This emphasizes the importance of considering trade-offs in R index selection aligned with project goals, specific sampling efforts, and population dynamics. For instance, the simplified binomial categorization of R defined by Conway (2017) (https://digitalcommons.coastal.edu/etd/10/) easier to interpret but R indices incorporating temporal components (e.g., monthly, seasonal, and annual) outperformed (>0.70 Gower’s distance) other R indices lacking such criteria. This allowed for a more detailed representation of the temporal structure of the population, and higher consistency and accuracy while classifying individuals. Also, although the residency categories proposed by Möller, Allen & Harcourt (2002) (DOI 10.1071/AM02011) did not perform as well, these seemed to fit better when dealing with data gaps across spatial and temporal scales. Our results contribute to the ongoing discussion on methodological implications for the interpretation of ecological patterns, facilitating a nuanced understanding of population dynamics, aiding scientists, and conservation agencies in making informed decisions for bottlenose dolphin populations worldwide. © 2024 PeerJ Inc..

ABSTRACT: Social tolerance is an essential feature of social life that can determine the good functioning of a group of animals. Play behaviors, like social play and playing with objects, are frequently associated with positive emotional and welfare states. As a result, zoos use various strategies to promote both social tolerance and play with objects. Providing animals with cognitive environmental enrichment can be an effective tool to achieve these goals. Here we tested whether cognitive environmental enrichment can promote social tolerance and play with objects in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). To this end, we provided a group of five dolphins with two types of cognitive enrichment: one for individual use and one for cooperative use, both based on the rope-pulling task paradigm. Then we evaluated whether social tolerance and play with objects had increased after we provided dolphins with the two enrichments. Our results go in this direction, showing that after we provided dolphins with the enrichments, their intolerance behaviors decreased, both during feeding sessions and play sessions, while their play with objects increased. As a result, the two enrichments we used could be useful for improving dolphins’ housing conditions. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: There are currently no standard methods for diagnosing cardiac diseases in dolphins. These diseases may consequently be overlooked and go undiagnosed. The presence and severity of cardiac diseases in humans can be determined using blood tests. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) used in human cardiac examinations has low species specificity. There have already been reports of homology between dolphin and human ANP; however, its potential for clinical application in dolphins has not been tested. This study was conducted to establish a reference for ANP levels in healthy bottlenose dolphins. Healthy bottlenose dolphins (seven females; estimated to be 7–30 years of age) at an aquarium in Japan were sampled. Each animal was tested for ANP at least three times, and the mean value and standard deviation were calculated to be 43.4 ± 19.2 pg/mL. In humans, patients with high plasma ANP levels have a poor prognosis. In veterinary medicine, cutoff values for the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation and heart failure in dogs have been established and used to predict prognosis. The results of the present study may contribute to the health management of bottlenose dolphins, particularly in the early detection and treatment of cardiac diseases. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Residency and site fidelity are important parameters in population ecology for many species as they indicate the temporal and spatial use for individuals. Although both terms are clearly different, they are used interchangeably due to lack of clarity in their definitions and the ways to assess them, especially in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.). Individuals with well-defined patterns of residency and site fidelity may be more vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances; thus, the study of these parameters may help to better assess such impacts. However, interspecific differences and logistical restrictions for the study of dolphins have prevented consensus. We set out to investigate the factors that have influenced measurements of residency and site fidelity in bottlenose and a set of other dolphin species through a retrospective (~30 y: 1990 to 2019) literature review. We found 117 scientific papers with a two-fold increasing trend approximately every 15 years, with 50% published in only four journals. Most of the studies were developed in the United States, followed by Australia and Europe, likely due to strict policies for marine mammal conservation. Author collaboration network analysis showed highly atomized national groups in which North American organizations formed the biggest cluster, followed by Australia, Africa, and Europe. However, large worldwide gaps still exist, possibly because of the heterogeneity in marine mammal sampling efforts and limited information availability in the North Pacific, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Indian Ocean. We found 30 different classification methods in which 12 were based on defined categories. We provide conceptual aid to distinguish between the use of both terms, as well as guidance to tackle the challenge of defining patterns of temporal use due to the variability of thresholds for classifying individuals. A paradigm shift is needed to create comprehensive, standardized, and generalized assessments of residency and site fidelity, which can be compared based on their performance across different populations of bottlenose dolphins around the world. © (2024), (Western Illinois University).

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans are specialized marine mammals with a unique respiratory system adapted for diving behavior. Furthermore, respiratory diseases are commonly observed in these mammals. Nevertheless, much of their respiratory physiology remains unknown due to the limited supply and poor quality of their biological samples for research. In this study, we established a novel lung cell line, dLu, derived from the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which can prove useful in cetacean research, including for understanding the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases in cetaceans. The cells were cultured in a simple medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The morphology of the cells was fibroblast-like. dLu was produced by transfecting the simian virus 40 large T antigen into primary cultured cells. Although dLu exhibited approximately 80 cell divisions, it was unable to achieve complete immortalization, as the cells stopped proliferating beyond this number. dLu cells expressed toll-like receptor 3 but not toll-like receptor 4. Immunostimulation with poly(I:C) altered the gene expressions of interferon beta 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in dLu cells. In summary, dLu established in this study is a novel cetacean cell resource that can be easily cultured and is a useful in vitro tool in cetacean research, particularly for studying host immune responses in the lungs. © The Society for In Vitro Biology 2023.

ABSTRACT: Background: A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) virus has been detected in domestic and wild animals worldwide. The incidence of HPAI infections in sea mammals has been increasing, as is the number of stranded marine mammals linked to H5N1 viral clade 2.3.4.4(b). In this study, we investigated a stranding event involving dolphins and human–dolphin contact, and investigated the potential risk of animal-to-human H5N1 transmission with a survey of exposure on the Tsurigasaki coast, Japan. Methods: We performed a non-random, convenient-sample-based, survey on Tsurigasaki beach where around 30 melon-headed whales were stranded on April 3, 2023. Face-to-face (n = 25) and telephone (n = 1) interviews among surfers took place on April 7 and 8. A nasal swab for quick antigen testing was taken from those who wished to be tested (n = 13), to detect infections with influenza A virus. Results: Although there was no confirmatory diagnosis of H5N1 in either humans or dolphins (while n = 3 dolphins were autopsied), we found that a large number of surfers had touched the dolphins with their bare hands while attempting to rescue them, and that some surfers were directly exposed to dolphin blood and body fluids in the ocean. Conclusions: The adequate communication of risk is required to minimize the threat of viral transmission at this particular human–animal interface. Administrative and legal responses to cross-species transmission, including guidelines via one health frameworks, a rapid evaluation process of ethical approval, and the systematic involvement of experts in infectious disease, must be urgently formulated. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In the western North Pacific, prominent granulomatous testes have been detected in many Brucella-infected common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), but there have been no reports in toothed cetaceans. We found severe orchitis with granulomatous lesions in a rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) stranded on the Pacific coast of Japan in 2011. Histopathological examination revealed leukocyte infiltration of the lesions. DNA from the lesion was analyzed by PCR and it showed molecular biological similarities with those of Brucella-infected common minke whales and Brucella ceti of sequence-type 27 (ST27). These results suggest that the type of Brucella ceti that infected the dolphin was ST27, which may have caused severe orchitis. This study adds to our understanding of Brucella infections in marine mammals. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: In contrast to many contemporary negative human-nature relationships, Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities have stewarded nature through cultural practices that include reciprocal contributions for both humans and nature. A rare example is the century-old artisanal fishery in which net-casting fishers and wild dolphins benefit by working together, but little is known about the persistence of the social-ecological system formed around this cultural practice. Here, we frame the human-dolphin cooperative fishery in southern Brazil as a social-ecological system based on secondary data from the scientific and grey literature. To investigate the dynamics of this system, we survey the local and traditional ecological knowledge and examine potential changes in its main component—the artisanal fishers—over time and space. Over 16 years, we conducted four interview campaigns with 188 fishers in fishing sites that are more open (accessible) or closed (restricted) to external influence. We investigated their experience, engagement and economic dependence on dolphin-assisted fishing, as well as the learning processes and transmission of the traditional knowledge required to cooperate with dolphins. Our qualitative data suggest that fishers using accessible and restricted fishing sites have equivalent fishing experience, but those in more restrictive sites tend to be more economically dependent on dolphins, relying on them for fishing year-round. The traditional knowledge on how to cooperate with dolphins is mostly acquired via social learning, with a tendency for vertical learning to be frequent among fishers using sites more restrictive for outsiders. Experience, economic dependence and reliance on vertical learning seem to decrease recently, especially in the accessible site. Our quantitative analyses, however, suggest that some of these fluctuations were not significant. Our study outlines the key components of this social-ecological system and identifies changes in the attributes of a main component, the users. These changes, when coupled with changes in other components such as governance and resource units (fish and dolphins), can have implications for the persistence of this cultural practice and the livelihoods of Local Communities. We suggest that continuous monitoring of this system can help to safeguard the reciprocal contributions of this human-nature relationship in years to come.

ABSTRACT: Over the past several decades, concern has grown over the rising mortality of the Amazon river dolphin (‘boto’) from increased human–dolphin interactions. Among these interactions are tourist attractions involving up-close feeding encounters with the botos, confrontations with fishers, and an illegal fishing practice that uses dolphin flesh as fish bait. Drawing on original data sourced from in-depth semi-structured interviews and household surveys, existing studies on boto habitat preferences and seasonal movement, and remotely-sensed data, this paper discusses the spatial and temporal overlap between humans and dolphins in a region outside of Manaus, Amazonas in the central Brazilian Amazon. Results suggest that there is considerable spatial overlap between boto habitat and spaces used for fishing and tourism activities; additionally, overall potential for conflict is greatest during the high-water season. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Trace elements (TEs) constitute the oldest emerging pollutants globally, most occur from natural sources, but a few are derived from anthropogenic sources. Marine mammals are considered bioindicators of ecosystem contamination. The aims of this review is compile reports on essential and nonessential TEs occurrence in small cetaceans from Argentinean waters; and to review the existing information on the concentration of TEs in the Franciscana dolphin, a biomonitor species of the Argentine coastal marine ecosystem. We searched reports where levels of TEs were present in small cetaceans from and eight species were analysed: Pontoporia blainvillei, Tursiops truncatus gephyreus, Kogia breviceps, Delphinus delphis, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, Lagenodelphis hasei, Cephaloryhchus commersonii and Ziphius cavirostris. Essential TEs like Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Se, As, Au, Ag, Sn, and nonessential TE as Pb, Cd, Hg, As was considered. The reports compiled in this article analysed kidney, liver, muscle and occasionally brain, skin, lung and spleen, covering a temporal range of 30 years, from 1982 to 2016. Of data analysis, we identify knowledge gaps, species of small cetaceans for which the concentration of trace metals is not yet known and areas on the Argentine coast where there are no reports that analyse them. The most recent information corresponds to the 2010 decade, and in those subsequent publications, the samples were taken at that time. This emphasizes the importance of reviewing this data, in order to compare old and new datasets, create contamination timelines and evaluate possible increases or decreases of contaminants in different study areas. The information recopilated will serve as valuable baselines to detect the future impact of increasing human, even natural, activities on marine ecosystems in the South Atlantic Ocean. © 2023

ABSTRACT: In this study, we recorded the noise radiating from a wind farm and evaluated its potential impact on the fishes and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) residing in the Pearl River Estuary. The pile driving pulses, recorded 30 ​m from the construction site, had a mean zero-to-peak sound pressure level of 196.5 ​dB (re 1 ​μPa) (n ​= ​636), exceeding the hearing thresholds of both fishes and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. The operational noise from the wind farm was significantly lower in amplitude; therefore, our analysis primarily focused on the radiation of pile driving noise. Acoustic measurements taken at three different distances during pile driving events supported the development of an acoustic propagation model, which was then used to predict the sound exposure levels of pile driving pulses radiating from 5 ​m below the water surface. By referring to established noise exposure metrics, we estimated an impact zone of 12.8 ​m for fishes. For the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, the permanent and temporary threshold shift zones were predicted to be 32.4 ​m and 580.9 ​m, respectively. Our findings underscore the importance of increasing our understanding on hearing sensitivities of the local inhabitants in the Pearl River Estuary and identify their core habitats. This approach enabled us to use the model to estimate impact zones and better protect the local marine life from the effects of pile driving noise radiation. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Interactions between dolphins and trammel net fisheries have been described in the Mediterranean Sea as having negative consequences for both cetaceans and fishers. There is a need for studies that evaluate the economic costs caused by dolphins feeding from entangled fishes in trammel nets since most cetacean species involved in these interactions are endangered. This study aims to evaluate the economic impact of the interaction between dolphins and trammel nets fisheries in the coastal waters of the Valencian region in the western Mediterranean Sea. We conducted at-port visual inspections of nets from April 2018 to March 2019, which included 1,849 fishing operations with trammel nets, and we recorded damages to the net and catch and the value of the fishery. Thirty-two interactions were detected during the year of the study. The only observed species interacting was the common bottlenose dolphin. No bycatch of dolphins was reported. The interactions have been impacted seasonally and most of them took place in February and March. There were no significant differences in catch when comparing sets with and without depredation or damage in nets due to depredation by dolphins. Also on average, no differences were found in the value of the catch when comparing sets with or without damage caused by dolphins. The main cost to the fisher was the cost of repairing the nets. The estimated financial loss per vessel and year was €556 (95%CI: €303–€809). This represents less than 1% of the total yearly income of each vessel in our area. We suggest implementing tools to economically compensate artisanal vessels for any damage caused by dolphins in order to avoid increasing the hostile feeling of fishers towards dolphins and to apply conservation measures to protect this cetacean species. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are aquatic mammals, whose role in microbial ecology is not fully understood. It is critical to study the microbiota of dolphins kept in captivity, as close contact with humans could unpredictably affect both human and animal health. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiota of 15 captive common bottlenose dolphins, and the relationship of microbial diversity and composition with animals’ age, sex, birthplace (dolphinarium or wildlife), and direct contacts with dolphinarium visitors using high-throughput V3-V4 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Based on acquired sequencing data we calculated and compared alpha and beta diversity indexes, as well as conducted differential abundance analysis of identified bacterial taxa to find multivariable associations with dolphins’ age period, sex, birthplace, and type of contact with humans with linear models. There was no association between gut microbiota composition and diversity and dolphins’ age period, sex, and birthplace. However, there were significant differences (q-value ≤ 0.00018) in the relative abundance of Edwardsiella genus in dolphins that were in contact only with dolphinarium staff in comparison to dolphins that apart from dolphinarium staff also had contact with dolphinarium visitors. These results show that dolphins born in wildlife and dolphinariums do not have significant differences in gut microbiota composition and the microbiota of captive dolphins can be affected by their contact with humans.

ABSTRACT: Neurobrucellosis is a shared condition of cetaceans and humans. However, the pathogenesis and immune response in cetacean neurobrucellosis has not been extensively studied. In this multicentric investigation, 21 striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) neurobrucellosis (Brucella ceti) cases diagnosed over a 10-year period (2012-2022) were retrospectively evaluated. For each case, morphological changes were assessed by evaluating 21 histological parameters. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical expression of Brucella antigen, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), and a selection of inflammatory cell (IBA-1, CD3, and CD20) and cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interferon-gamma [IFN-γ], interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-2, and IL-6) markers were investigated. Inflammation of the leptomeninges, ependyma, and/or choroid plexus was lymphohistiocytic, containing macrophages/microglia (IBA-1+), T-cells (CD3+), and B-cells (CD20+) in equal proportion. B-cells occasionally formed tertiary follicles. GFAP expression showed astrocytosis in most cases. Expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2 indicated an intense proinflammatory response, stimulating both macrophages and T-cells. Our results showed that the inflammation and neuroinflammation in neurobrucellosis of striped dolphins mimic human neurobrucellosis and in vitro and in vivo studies in laboratory animals. Cetacean disease surveillance can be exploited to expand the knowledge of the pathogenesis and immunology of infectious diseases, particularly brucellosis, under a One Health approach. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment has gained significant attention in recent years as a vital approach to promoting natural behaviours and well-being in captive animals [1–3]. This presentation explores the significance of environmental enrichment for Black Sea bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus ponticus) in human care, with a focus on the strategies implemented at the Lithuanian Sea Museum Dolphinarium. A variety of enrichment strategies, including interactive training sessions and novel stimuli, have been used to create diverse enrichment experiences, which are categorised into five main areas: sensory, cognitive, social, food-related, and physical habitat [2–3]. The importance of engaging dolphins during their free time is emphasised, clarifying that these enrichment activities are distinct from training sessions and do not involve food rewards. Furthermore, a notable tool developed at the Lithuanian Maritime Museum, recognised internationally, is introduced, highlighting its effectiveness in stimulating cognitive engagement. The importance of ongoing monitoring and categorisation of enrichment activities is discussed to maintain dolphin interest and prevent habituation [4]. Lastly, future plans will focus on knowledge exchange within the animal conservation community, aiming to enhance understanding of dolphin behaviour and continually improve enrichment strategies. © (2024), (Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija).

ABSTRACT: This study examines the effect of common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus on the purse-seine fishery for small pelagic fishes in the Mediterranean Sea and the economic consequences thereof. The investigation focused on the fleet registered at the port of Al Hoceima, Morocco, and used information collected from on-board observations and a semi-structured questionnaire with fishermen and ship-owners. A total of 121 dolphins were captured as bycatch during 48 fishing trips, with a mortality rate of 0.23 dolphins per fishing trip. In terms of damage to the fishing gear, the number of observed holes varied between 28 and 230 per net per incident. Though some tears were large, most were &amp;#x003C;35 cm in height. The cost of repairing the holes in the nets caused by these interactions was estimated at US$179.52 per mending event. The level of interaction between common bottlenose dolphins and the purse-seine fishery targeting small pelagic fishes is a challenge for both fishery management and dolphin conservation. © 2024 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Photographic analysis of skin lesions is a noninvasive approach to estimate the health of cetacean populations. The St. Johns River (SJR) in NE Florida is an estuarine system inhabited by Tamanend's bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops erebennus) that is characterized by high levels of anthropogenic activity. Both environmental factors and social transmission of disease may influence lesion formation in dolphins, thus this study aimed to determine if skin lesion prevalence and extent of coverage differed based on (1) the amount of time spent in the SJR annually and (2) sociality measures. Photos were examined for lesions on the dorsal fin and total visible body. Individuals were categorized as residents, seasonals, or transients based on the monthly sighting rate in cold and warm seasons. The mean nonzero SRI and degree centrality were compared to lesion prevalence and coverage. Residents exhibited the highest prevalence of skin lesions, followed by seasonals and transients. Coverage in affected individuals did not significantly differ among residency groups. Lesion prevalence was higher in the SJR than nearby sites. Associations between sociality and lesion measures were not significant. These results suggest that habitat use primarily drives lesion occurrence in SJR dolphins. © 2024 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: In the Adriatic Sea, a female common bottlenose dolphin named “Boa” was observed on 19 occasions between 2009 and 2019, inhaling via her mouth for every observed respiration. We provide some explanations for the potential cause of this behaviour using existing evidence. Boa appeared to be in good physical shape and displayed behaviour similar to other individuals. She mothered three calves, raising at least one to independence successfully. Because she lived a normal life, we believe she could vocalise and echolocate. Boa may have been forced to breathe through her mouth to deal with internal injuries, occlusion, or disease. Of the potential causes, an occlusion of the upper respiratory tract seems more likely than a perforation or permanent dislocation of the larynx. An occlusion could result from disease, a congenital disorder, and/or wrongly ingested or inhaled food items or foreign materials. To breathe via the mouth, Boa must have been able to circumvent the separation of the respiratory tract from the oral cavity. By relaxing the respiratory muscles, particularly the palatopharyngeus, she could have used the negative pressure of the lungs to pull in air from the oropharynx into the upper respiratory tract. The true cause of Boa’s condition will probably never be discovered. © (2024), (Western Illinois University). All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Studying the abundance, distribution, and habitat use of dolphins can provide essential information for preserving marine biodiversity, managing coastal ecosystems, and enhancing our understanding of aquatic life. Herein, we investigated the abundance, distribution, and habitat use of two dolphin populations—Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)—in the Gulf of Urabá, Colombian Caribbean. Between 2017 and 2020, 34 non-systematic surveys were conducted across the studied region, amounting to an effort of 176.69 hours and covering 3,658.33 km, with a dolphin encounter probability rate of 8.65%. The Guiana dolphin population was estimated at 63 (95% CI = 53 to 76) individuals, whereas the common bottlenose dolphin population was estimated at 50 (95% CI = 43 to 58) individuals. The dolphins were mainly found in the central region of the Gulf, particularly around the Atrato River mouth and the east side of the estuary. Both species showed a preference for coastal areas with maximum depths of 20 m, and the Guiana dolphins showed a permanent presence in the Gulf of Urabá region. These findings indicate that the Gulf of Urabá acts as a crucial habitat and feeding ground for both Guiana and common bottlenose dolphins. Therefore, systematic monitoring programmes aiming to protect dolphin populations and their ecosystems from threats posed by coastal development, which currently endanger both species in the area, should be implemented. © (2024), (Western Illinois University).

ABSTRACT: Assessing distribution and abundance patterns for rare species is challenging yet imperative, considering the extant, potentially hazardous, anthropogenic activities. In particular, the poorly studied Chilean dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia) exhibits an extremely patchy distribution and low densities, co-occurring with the intensive aquaculture industry in Southern Chile, among other anthropogenic activities. The distribution and abundance patterns of Chilean dolphins were assessed in the entire Northern Chilean Patagonia. A hierarchical species distribution model was fitted to data from line transect surveys using distance sampling techniques and environmental variables derived from topographic features and oceanographic models. A second version of this model used a joint-likelihood approach to incorporate presence–pseudoabsence data for improving parameter estimation. Spatial predictions arising from these models were used to evaluate the relative probability of a dolphin encountering vessels from the local, predominantly aquaculture fleet. The results show that using a joint-likelihood approach drastically reduced uncertainty in the parameters controlling the effect of covariates and in the total abundance estimates. This model estimated an overall low abundance (median 2,225.8; 95% CI 1,340–3,867) for this species in the region, and indicates their preference for shallow, sheltered bays and inner channels, near river mouths, where low salinity is expected. The highest probabilities of dolphin–vessel interactions were found on the eastern coast of Chiloe Big Island, coinciding with the largest number of aquaculture concessions in the area. Considering that the overall population of the Chilean dolphin is expected to be in the low thousands, that suitable habitat for the species is highly restricted, and that the species is facing increasing anthropogenic impacts, with some areas undergoing or planning major expansions in development, the results provided here should be considered in management plans for extant marine protected areas, and in the evaluation of current International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and national conservation categories for the species. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Inia geoffrensis is an endangered species of the Amazon River basin, but there has been limited research regarding its health, particularly in describing normal cell morphology by traditional techniques. This study aimed to identify the peripheral blood cells of I. geoffrensis through microscopic evaluation. Blood smears were collected from wild adults and stained with Wright's stain. We differentiated leukocyte cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) and platelets. Additionally, we observed signs of inflammatory reactions in cell morphology by incrementing cell size and active cytoplasm in neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. These findings provide important considerations for hemogram interpretation in future research and individual clinical cases in Amazon River dolphins. Also, our study delivers baseline information for future characterization and understanding of hemogram and leukogram changes in response to disease and health assessment for dolphin species. © 2023, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

ABSTRACT: Several studies have explored dolphins feeding ecology in coastal ecosystems; However, research gauging the predatory effects of delphinid on ecosystems, which can be applied to management and conservation efforts, is still lacking. The northwestern section of the bay of Santa Catarina Island, locally known as North Bay, in Southern Brazil, inhabits the southernmost population of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis). This small and resident population is structured in a single and highly cohesive group, using a small home range restricted to the western section of the bay. Like many other coastal dolphins, this dolphin population negatively interacts with fisheries, with frequent bycatch events or by sharing feeding resources. To explore the ecological role of dolphins in the North Bay ecosystem, we constructed an Ecopath food web model to estimate ecosystem and compartmental attributes. Mixed trophic impact and keystoneness index were used to assess the predatory effects of the species in the ecosystem. As a complementary approach to Ecopath, we used ecological network analysis (ENA) to determine the ecological role of the compartments using control analysis and the throughflow centrality. According to our model, North Bay is a mature detritus-based ecosystem. Dolphins showed the highest keystoneness index score among all functional groups, while control analysis showed they are also the most controlled component in the ecosystem. The dolphins rely mainly on the Whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri), a hub species showing the greatest centrality of flows. We concluded that the Guiana dolphin inhabiting the North Bay is a crucial compartment in the ecosystem. It shows the greatest ecosystem impact per biomass unit among all functional groups, while it is the most vulnerable compartment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Reproductive parameters were assessed in 64 male common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) examined post-mortem from strandings and bycatch in New Zealand between 1999 and 2020. The stages of male sexual maturation were assessed using morphological measurements and histological examination of testicular tissue. Age was determined via growth layer groups (GLGs) in teeth. The average age (ASM) and length (LSM) at attainment of sexual maturity were estimated to be 8.8 years and 198.3 cm, respectively. Individual variation in ASM (7.5–10 years) and LSM (190–220 cm) was observed in New Zealand common dolphins. However, on average, sexual maturity was attained at a similar length but at a marginally younger age (< 1 year) in New Zealand compared to populations in the Northern Hemisphere. All testicular variables proved better predictors of sexual maturity compared to demographic variables (age and total body length), with combined testes weight the best outright predictor of sexual maturity. Reproductive seasonality was observed in male common dolphins, with a significant increase in combined testes weight in austral summer. This aligns with most other studied populations, where seasonality in reproduction is typically observed. Given the known anthropogenic impacts on New Zealand common dolphins, we recommend that these findings be used as a baseline from which to monitor population-level changes as part of conservation management efforts. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a well-known cetacean species that inhabits temperate and tropical seas worldwide. Limited supply and poor quality of samples hinder the investigation of the effects of various pathogens and environmental pollutants on this cetacean species. Cultured cells are useful for experimental studies; however, no cell lines derived from cetaceans are generally available. Therefore, in this study, we established a novel kidney cell line, TK-ST, derived from T. truncatus. Primary cells exhibited the morphological characteristics of epithelial and fibroblast cells, but their immortalization and passaging resulted in a predominantly epithelial cell morphology. TK-ST was immortalized using the large T SV40 antigen and human telomerase reverse transcriptase and exhibited long-term stable cell growth. TK-ST cells are generally cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO2 but can also be cultured in 5–20% fetal bovine serum and several other classical media commonly used for common animal cell culture. TK-ST cells were found to be susceptible to several viruses, including the dolphin morbillivirus (most important virus in cetaceans), and exhibited cytopathic effects, facilitating the replication of the dolphin morbillivirus. Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of cytokine genes were increased in TK-ST cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharides and poly(I:C). Therefore, the novel TK-ST cell line derived in this study can potentially be used for further in vitro studies on cetaceans. © 2023, The Society for In Vitro Biology.

ABSTRACT: This survey is part of the installation of Tripod Jackets in Makassar Bay, targeting the North Side, North Nubi and Jumelai, PT Pertamina Hulu Mahakam in East Kalimantan waters. This study aims to provide marine mammal observation to the JSN project. Expert help is essential because it complies with the International Maritime Organization MEPC.1/circ.833 rules. From 13th April to 2nd June 2021, observations were made using visual and passive acoustic methods (SQ26: H1 recorder). The visual observation focus was from 500 meters to 1000 meters. The team found that the dolphins that appeared were bottlenose, long-beaked, and dolphins were not identified. The highest prevalence was during the pilling of 12 dolphins at JML 1 site (after the GTS installation and adjustment). Long-beaked and unidentified dolphins were found in WPN 4 location. The dolphins seen were Tursiops species, while the turtles seen were green turtles. When watching dolphins, sightings occurred mainly at night. In the next task, the collection process, we want to discuss the process that produces a high sound on the water's surface. We recommend using "early warning". The warning will be done after the routine inventory, and we hope the staff can do it three times. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Intermittent locomotion composed of periods of active flapping/stroking followed by inactive gliding has been observed with species that inhabit both aerial and marine environments. However, studies on the energetic benefits of a fluke-and-glide (FG) gait during horizontal locomotion are limited for dolphins. Thiswork presents a physics-based model of FG gait and an analysis of the associated cost of transport for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). New gliding drag coefficients for themodel were estimated usingmeasured data fromfree-swimming bottlenose dolphins. The data-driven approach used kinematic measurement from 84 h of biologging tag data collected from three animals to estimate the coefficients. A set of 532 qualifying gliding events were automatically extracted for estimation of the gliding drag coefficient. Next, data from783 FGbouts were parameterized and used with the model-based dynamic analysis to investigate the cost benefits of FG gait. Experimental results indicate that FG gait was preferred at speeds of ∼2.2-2.7 m s-1. Observed FG bouts had an average duty factor of 0.45 and a gliding duration of 5 s. The average associated metabolic cost of transport (COT) and mechanical cost of transport (MECOT) of FG gait are 2.53 and 0.35 J m-1 kg-1, respectively, at the preferred speeds. This corresponded to a respective 18.9% and 27.1% reduction in cost when compared with model predictions of continuous fluking gait at the same average bout speed. Average thrust was positively correlated with fluking frequency and amplitude as animals accelerated during the FG bouts, whereas fluking frequency and amplitude were negatively correlated for a given thrust range. These results suggest that FG gait enhances the horizontal swimming efficiency of bottlenose dolphins and provides new insights into the gait dynamics of these animals. © 2023.

ABSTRACT: The microbiota of the gastrointestinal system of dolphins has received significant interest recently. Moreover, little is understood about the microbiomes found in the stomachs of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). This study aimed to evaluate the biodiversity of bacterial microbiota in the digestive system of T. aduncus. In the present study, 18 samples were obtained from an ex-situ conservation area, Wersut Seguni Indonesia, Kendal, Indonesia, and processed for bacterial DNA extraction. A total of 7 samples were qualified as representative samples for the 16S metagenomic sequencing. The bacterial composition revealed that the Shewanellaceae was significantly higher in the stomach than in the gut. As a result, the abundance of the microbiome in gastric and stool samples showed significant differences. In contrast, the Peptostreptococcaceae was found in greater abundance in the gut than in the stomach. At the species level, we successfully found emerging zoonotic pathogens involving Shewanella algae and Shewanella xiamenensis. This report is the first study to explore the bacterial diversity in gastro of T. aduncus. © Authors, 2023, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Mosul.

ABSTRACT: Although the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, has become a top oil exporter, it is unknown if local dolphins are disturbed by high year-round vessel traffic. A shore-based digital theodolite and automatic identification system receiver were used to record data to assess common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) behavioral states and movement patterns in the Corpus Christi Ship Channel (CCSC) in relation to vessel traffic. Multinomial logistic regression and generalized additive models were applied to analyze the data. Vessels were present within 300 m of dolphins during 80% of dolphin observations. Dolphins frequently foraged (40%), traveled (24%), socialized (15%), and milled (14%), but rarely oriented against the current (7%) or rested (1% of observations). Season, time of day, group size, vessel type, vessel size, and number of vessels were significant predictors of dolphin behavioral state. Significant predictors of dolphin movement patterns included season, time of day, group size, calf presence, vessel type, and vessel numbers. The CCSC is an important foraging area for dolphins, yet the high level of industrial activity puts the dolphins at risk of human-related disturbance and injury. There is a crucial need to monitor the impact of increased anthropogenic influences on federally protected dolphins in the active CCSC, with broad application to dolphins in other ports. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The social intelligence hypothesis holds that complex social relationships are the major selective force underlying the evolution of large brain size and intelligence. Complex social relationships are exemplified by coalitions and alliances that are mediated by affiliative behavior, resulting in differentiated but shifting relationships. Male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, form three alliance levels or ‘orders’, primarily among non-relatives. Strategic alliance formation has been documented within both first- and second-order alliances and between second-order alliances (‘third-order alliances’), revealing that the formation of strategic inter-group alliances is not limited to humans. Here we conducted a fine-scale study on 22 adult males over a 6-year period to determine if third-order alliance relationships are differentiated, and mediated by affiliative interactions. We found third-order alliance relationships were strongly differentiated, with key individuals playing a disproportionate role in maintaining alliances. Nonetheless, affiliative interactions occurred broadly between third-order allies, indicating males maintain bonds with third-order allies of varying strength. We also documented a shift in relationships and formation of a new third-order alliance. These findings further our understanding of dolphin alliance dynamics and provide evidence that strategic alliance formation is found in all three alliance levels, a phenomenon with no peer among non-human animals. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) inhabiting the Chinese coastline of the northern South China Sea are subject to intense human activity. To investigate potential impacts to dolphins, photographs taken from 2010 to 2021 in five different locations were analyzed. Among individual dolphins (N = 1,159), 10.6% presented human-induced injuries. Adults were more frequently injured than young dolphins, and individuals from around Jiangmen, Hainan, and Sanniang Bay presented the highest injury prevalence. More research should be conducted in areas that have been subject to less research, such as Jiangmen and Hainan, and the dolphin watching activities occurring in Sanniang Bay should be monitored and regulated. Forty-seven percent of dolphins presented skin conditions, with orange patches being the most frequent (41.5%). Orange patches and hyper-pigmented pink spots were significantly less prevalent in summer and fall than in winter and spring. Orange patches were less frequent in females than in males, as well as with calves relative to older age classes. Seasonal patterns may be linked to water temperatures, while demographic patterns may be associated with immune defenses. These findings allow for a better understanding of the potential impact of human activities on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and should inform further conservation measures. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Mercury is a metal of toxicological importance that occurs naturally. However, its concentration can be affected by anthropogenic activities and has the potential to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in food webs. Thus, knowing how its concentration varies along the trophic levels allows us to understand its potential risks to the biota. The present study aimed to investigate mercury transfer through the Stenella frontalis food web in Ilha Grande Bay (IGB), Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Samples of muscle and liver of S. frontalis were obtained from carcasses (n = 8) found stranded in the IGB, and its potential prey species were collected in fishing landings in the same Bay (n = 145). Total mercury (THg) concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, and the δ15N was determined by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. To investigate how trophic transfer affects mercury contamination in biota, six linear models were applied between THg logarithmic concentrations and δ15N or trophic position (TP). The trophic magnification factor (TMF) was calculated from each model to estimate the trophic transfer. Mean THg concentration in S. frontalis was higher in the liver than in muscle, but no correlation was found with age and δ15N values. Instead, the hepatic and muscular THg concentrations positively correlated with the trophic position. In the summer, THg concentration, TP, and δ15N values in prey species varied significantly, as well as in the winter, except for THg concentration. All trophic transfer models were significant in both seasons, and the TMF >1. The present study showed that trophic transfer is an essential factor in mercury biomagnification in both seasons but is not the unique driver. Both δ15N and TP could explain mercury trophic transfer, but TP better integrates metabolic diversity and seasonality. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Mortality patterns in cetaceans are critical to understanding population health. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus truncatus) inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida have been subjected to four unusual mortality events (UMEs), highlighting the need to evaluate morbidity and mortality patterns. Complete gross examinations were conducted on 392 stranded dolphins and histopathological analyses were conducted for 178 animals (2002-2020). The probable causes of mortality were grouped by etiologic category: degenerative, metabolic, nutritional, inflammatory (infectious and noninfectious disease), and trauma. Probable cause of mortality was determined in 57% (223/392) of cases. Inflammatory disease (infectious/noninfectious) and trauma were the most common. Inflammatory disease accounted for 41% of cases (91/223), with the lungs (pneumonia) most commonly affected. Trauma accounted for 36% of strandings (80/223). The majority of trauma cases were due to anthropogenic activities (entanglement, fishing gear or other debris ingestion, and propeller strikes), accounting for 58% of trauma cases (46/80). Natural trauma (prey-associated esophageal obstruction or asphyxiation, shark bites, and stingray interactions) accounted for 12% of all cases (26/223), and trauma of undetermined origin was identified in 4% of cases (8/223). Starvation or inanition (nutritional) were the probable cause of mortality in 17% of cases and peaked during the 2013 UME (61% of cases). Degenerative and metabolic etiologies accounted for 5% of cases. This study represents the most comprehensive evaluation of morbidity and mortality patterns in IRL dolphins. Because IRL dolphins are routinely exposed to anthropogenic threats and have endured multiple UMEs, these baseline data are critical to the conservation and management of this population. © Wildlife Disease Association 2023.

ABSTRACT: 1. Studies on the ranging patterns and habitat use of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Southeast Asia are scarce but essential to inform conservation and management of a species known to be susceptible to anthropogenic pressures. 2. This study is the first to investigate the long-term movement, range sizes and habitat use of humpback dolphins in the Langkawi Archipelago and adjacent Perlis-Kedah mainland coast of Malaysia using boat-based photo-identification surveys conducted between 2010 and 2020. 3. A total of 669 humpback dolphin individuals were identified, making it one of the largest photo-ID catalogues within their geographic range. Lagged identification rates suggested that some individuals maintained long-term site fidelity in the study area. 4. Low transition probabilities and 194 photo-identification matches revealed humpback dolphins moved minimally between Langkawi and the adjacent Perlis-Kedah mainland; however, most southward dolphin movements did not extend beyond Kuala Jerlun in northern Kedah. 5. The mean range sizes estimated for 16 regularly sighted individuals through minimum convex polygon and kernel density estimate 95% utilization distribution were significantly different, at 338.2 ± 183.8 and 75.6 ± 28.6 km2, respectively. 6. Most individual and population core areas (i.e. kernel density estimate 50% utilization distribution) overlapped with core feeding and nursery grounds in shallow coastal and estuarine waters (i.e. <10 m deep and <1.3 km from the coastline). 7. Dolphin range size and spatial use patterns were probably linked to prey distribution and availability (i.e. influenced by environmental factors such as habitat features) and social groupings and dynamics. 8. These findings inform science-based recommendations for habitat management, including implementing restricted areas from coastal development, vessel speed-limit zones and boating codes-of-conduct, to minimize anthropogenic impacts and support sustainable coastal development in the binational Satun-Langkawi Important Marine Mammal Area. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) is a widespread species inhabiting both hemispheres. Information on the penetration of this species into Russian waters is extremely scarce, although this is a fairly common species in adjacent waters. In this paper, we provide new data on stranding and overview the occurrence of Risso’s dolphin in Russia. In 2020, a Risso’s dolphin was stranded in Primorsky Region and died. The dolphin was a male, 337 cm long, surpassing the size of all known conspecifics in the western North Pacific. Histological analysis of the lung tissue showed extensive fibrosis. There were coronulid barnacles Xenobalanus globicipitis attached to the dolphin’s fluke, which apparently related to the dolphin’s health status. Information about the presence of Xenobalanus in Russia is almost completely absent in the literature, despite the existence of specialized works on biofouling on cetaceans. Throughout the all history of observations in Russian waters, Risso’s dolphin sightings were reported at three occasions off the southern Kurils and the Commander Islands, and once in the Bering Sea. Stranded dead animals were reported at the northern Kuril Islands. Two cases of live strandings are now known for Primorsky Region. Russian waters may serve for occasional entries but are not part of Risso’s dolphin’s normal range due to oceanological conditions of the region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung.

ABSTRACT: Effective conservation protection requires the consideration of biological information and socioeconomic costs during the planning stage of reserve development, especially when coastal species occupy habitats that overlap with intensive human activities. Because of the public and liquid nature of the maritime environment, it is difficult to obtain data on its protection costs. Therefore, it is feasible to select a reasonable surrogate cost. This study explored how the spatial priority of marine protected areas changed under three different protection surrogate costs: habitat area, number of ships, and marine zone function; protection targets were set at 5 % and 10 %. This analysis was based on the distribution data of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Xiamen Bay, a highly urbanised coastal city in southeast China. Using habitat area as a cost surrogate, the protection boundary length was the largest, but the projected protection area was the smallest, and function loss was also considerable. Using the number of ships as a cost surrogate, both the protection area and function loss were the largest. Using marine zone function as a cost surrogate, the optimal scenario was achieved in which the protection area was of moderate size and the boundary cost and function loss were the smallest. The higher the protection target percentage, the greater the correlation between the results of different protection cost scenarios; the marine zone functional cost scenario had the highest correlation with that of the habitat area cost scenario, while the correlation between the number of ships cost scenario and the habitat area cost scenario was the lowest. The predicted spatial distribution of protected areas differed under the same protection target and cost scenario, owing to seasonal variation in suitable habitats for S. chinensis. Our results suggested that the Jiulong River estuary should be protected and that the currently protected area of Tongan Bay needs to be expanded in the dry season. In the wet season, the southern part of the existing protected area, the marine habitats of the Jiulong River estuary, the northwestern part of Wuyu, and the southern part of Dadeng-Xiaodeng need to be expanded. This study demonstrated a utilitarian exploration of the Marxan model to aid in the protection of rare marine species in coastal areas, providing reference data for the conservation planning of S. chinensis and other marine species. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals have always captured the imagination of the people they share their environment with, but few people know that various species populate the waters of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The world's second largest population of dugongs reside in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, while two species of dolphins (Indian Ocean humpback and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin) and the elusive finless porpoises inhabit Abu Dhabi and Dubai waters. Facing both the Sea of Oman and the Arabian Gulf, the UAE hosts a total of 18 species of marine mammals. These include the biggest animal on Earth, the blue whale, Bryde's, humpback whales and killer whales, to name a few. However, ecological information about these species is still scarce. With the exponential increase of anthropogenic pressure and effects of climate change on the UAE marine environment, they are facing the risk of disappearing unnoticed. It is imperative to gain a better understanding of their ecology and main threats that affect them to support the implementation of effective conservation measures. Here we review the evolutionary history and adaptation to the water environment of these charismatic group of animals and provide the most up-to-date information on their status in UAE. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Bisphenols (BPs) and phthalate esters (PAEs) are important compounds for the plastics industry, also called “everywhere chemicals” due to their ubiquity in daily use products. Both chemical groups are well-known environmental contaminants, whose presence has been reported in all environmental compartments, and whose effects, mainly associated to endocrine disruption, are detrimental to living organisms. Cetaceans, due to their long life-span, low reproduction rate and high position in the trophic web, are especially vulnerable to the effects of contaminants. However, little is known about BP and PAE concentrations in cetacean tissues, their potential relation to individual biological variables, or their trends over time. Here, the concentration of 10 BPs and 13 PAEs was assessed in the muscle of 30 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded along the Spanish Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) between 1990 and 2018. Six BP and 6 PAE compounds were detected, of which only 4,4′-(cyclohexane-1,1-diyl)diphenol (BPZ) was detected in all the samples, at the highest concentration (mean 16.06 μg g−1 lipid weight). Sex or reproductive condition were largely uninfluential on concentrations: only dimethylphthalate (DMP) concentrations were significantly higher in immature individuals than in adults, and the overall PAE concentrations were significantly higher in males than in females. Temporal variations were only detected in bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (BPE), diethylphthalate (DEP) and dimethylphthalate (DMP), whose concentrations were lower, and 9,9-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene (BPFL), which were higher, respectively, in samples taken between 2014 and 2018, probably reflecting shifts in the production and use of these chemicals. These results provide the first assessment of concentrations of several BP and PAE compounds in the muscle of an odontocete cetacean. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals are considered sentinel species and may act as indicators of ocean health. Plastic residues are widely distributed in the oceans and are recognised as hazardous contaminants, and once ingested can cause several adverse effects on wildlife. This study aimed to identify and characterise plastic ingestion in the Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from the Southwestern Tropical Atlantic by evaluating the stomach contents of stranded individuals through KOH digestion and identification of subsample of particles by LDIR Chemical Imaging System. Most of the individuals were contaminated, and the most common polymers identified were PU, PET and EVA. Microplastics were more prevalent than larger plastic particles (meso- and macroplastics). Smaller particles were detected during the rainy seasons. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the stomach content mass and the number of microplastics, suggesting contamination through trophic transfer. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Aquatic animals such as fish and cetaceans can actively modulate their body stiffness with muscle to achieve excellent swimming performance under different situations. However, it is still challenging for a robotic swimmer with bionic propulsion mode to dynamically adjust its body stiffness to improve the swimming speed due to the difficulties in designing an effective stiffness adjustment structure. In this paper, based on the special torque mode of a motor, we propose an active variable stiffness control method for a robotic dolphin to pursue better swimming speed. Different from a variable stiffness structure design, a torque control strategy for the caudal motor is employed to imitate the physical property of a torsion spring to act as the variable stiffness component. In addition, we also establish a dynamic model with the Lagrangian method to explore the variable stiffness mechanism. Extensive experiments have validated the dynamic model, and then the relationships between frequency and stiffness on swimming performance are presented. More importantly, through integrating the dynamic model and torque actuation mode-based variable stiffness mechanism, the online performance optimization scheme can be easily realized, providing valuable guidance in coordinating system parameters. Finally, experiments have demonstrated the stiffness adjustment capability of the caudal joint, validating the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The results also reveal that stiffness plays an essential role in swimming motion, and the active stiffness adjustment can significantly contribute to performance improvement in both speed and efficiency. Namely, with the adjustment of stiffness, the maximum speed of our robotic dolphin achieves up to 1.12 body length per second (BL/s) at 2.88 Hz increasing by 0.44 BL/s. Additionally, the efficiency is also improved by 37%. The conducted works will offer some new insights into the stiffness adjustment of robotic swimmers for better swimming performance. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Field tests indicate that strong ice-induced vibration is a common safety risk for offshore platform structures in cold regions. The isolation principle may provide a solution to reduce ice-induced vibrations, considering the position and movement direction of the ice sheet interacting with platform piles. In this study, an isolation cone system is designed and installed on a mooring dolphin platform in the Bohai Sea. The isolation cone system comprises cones and laminated rubber bearing isolators and is installed on the platform piles to reduce dynamic coupling between the ice sheet and platform structure. Field tests indicate that the ice-induced vibration acceleration of the platform structure is significantly reduced and the isolation cone system can have a significant affect in reducing ice-induced vibration of offshore platform structures. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.

ABSTRACT: As the Whale and dolphin Watching (WW) industry grows, so does the need for better industry management. The present study aims to both evaluate the current compliance of WW operators with local WW statutory tools, as well as gain a multi-perspective overview of WW activities in the Strait of Gibraltar. To this end, a total of 637 questionnaires were filled out by stakeholders including WW customers and operators, researchers, environmental NGOs, technicians, and policy makers in Tarifa and Gibraltar between 2017 and 2019. A direct assessment of WW activities was also carried out in 2019. Results suggest that (1) local operators only partially follow rules, (2) customers prefer, and give higher ratings to operators when cetaceans are indifferent to or approach vessels and (3) stakeholders recognise the educational, scientific, and recreational values of WW. Suggestions for the improvement of compliance include the land-based monitoring of WW activities, the analysis of Automatic Identification System data and an increase in patrolling and enforcement (e.g., revoking of licenses). Moreover, the introduction of structured educational programmes during WW activities the designation of Marine Protected Areas, and of a regional shipping plan, together with an integrated management approach, could benefit the WW industry and improve its sustainability in the Strait. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In human-altered environments, wildlife is impacted by a range of factors; therefore, understanding on responsible factors can aid in developing conservation strategies. Irrawaddy Dolphins (IRD: Oracella brevirostris) are a group of cetaceans listed as highly endangered species under - threatened species red list of IUCN. A subpopulation of IRD is found in Chilika lagoon, a brackish-water ecosystem in the eastern seaboard of India, which is also the single largest habitat of IRD in the world. They are survived by only a few hundred individuals in small pockets in Chilika and are therefore given maximum protection under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972), but much remains to be done for their conservation as they have not drawn enough investigation. This article comprehensively synthesizes existing literature on IRD, has established linkages between their behavior and physiology with threats (both climate-driven and anthropogenic), and has finally laid down a conservation and management roadmap to safeguard their future in Chilika. Damming and diversion of rivers opening in Chilika, unsustainable dolphin watching tourism, pollution, and net entanglement are some of the prominent threats faced by IRD in Chilika. Predicted climate change scenarios such as potential warming of the lagoon, increased littoral drift, sea level rise, and increased frequency of cyclones would exacerbate their survival crisis. It is also emphasized that the conservation strategy of IRD must be moved from species-centric to ecosystem-based for their long-term sustenance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Brucella ceti infections have been increasingly reported in cetaceans. In this study, we analyzed all cases of B. ceti infection detected in striped dolphins stranded along the Italian coastline between 2012 and 2021 (N = 24). We focused on the pathogenic role of B. ceti through detailed pathological studies, and ad hoc microbiological, biomolecular, and serological investigations, coupled with a comparative genomic analysis of the strains. Neurobrucellosis was observed in 20 animals. The primary histopathologic features included non-suppurative meningoencephalitis (N = 9), meningitis (N = 6), and meningoencephalomyelitis (N = 5), which was also associated with typical lesions in other tissues (N = 8). Co-infections were detected in more than half of the cases, mostly involving Cetacean Morbillivirus (CeMV). The 24 B. ceti isolates were assigned primarily to sequence type 26 (ST26) (N = 21) and, in a few cases, ST49 (N = 3). The multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) data showed that strains from Italy clustered into four genetically distinct clades. Plotting these clades onto a geographic map suggests a link between their phylogeny and the topographical distribution. These results support the role of B. ceti as a primary neurotropic pathogen for striped dolphins and highlight the utility of WGS data in understanding the evolution of this emerging pathogen. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of the spectrum and frequency of species-appropriate behaviors is valuable when evaluating the welfare of animals living under professional care. Dolphins have a rich behavioral repertoire and behavioral metrics have been used to quantify behavior. Data in the present study were collected as part of a larger study titled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study). Behavior data were collected on 43 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at 23 facilities. Dolphins were video recorded three times per week for 25 min over one five-week data collection period between July and November of 2018 and a second five-week data collection period between January and April of 2019. Solo and group swimming were the two most common behavior states for dolphins. Group active, chase, fast swimming, tactile, and ventral swimming were significantly impacted by age. Interacting with conspecifics was significantly impacted by time of day. The rate of fluke-out dives was associated with sex. Behavioral diversity was significantly impacted by age and sex. The findings presented here are representative of behavioral observations collected from the largest number of individuals in the largest number of zoo and aquarium habitats that have been published to date. These results provide the first normal reference intervals for behavior and a comprehensive activity budget that encompasses the behavior of dolphins living in a variety of accredited zoo and aquarium habitat types and social structures. The activity budgets and reference intervals are valuable as a tool for monitoring welfare and for increasing our understanding of typical dolphin behavior across broad environmental and management conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Amazon River dolphin Inia geoffrensis occurs throughout the basins of the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers and is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Using satellite tracking data from eight dolphins (one female and seven males) in the Peruvian Amazon, we demonstrate that these dolphins inhabit a variety of habitat types and have core areas and home range areas of variable magnitudes. To gain a better understanding of how threats affect these dolphins, we examined the distance of dolphin records to locations of current and potential future anthropogenic threats. On average, dolphin home ranges overlapped with fisheries by 89%. Dolphins were found at an average distance of 252 km from the nearest proposed dam and 125 km from the nearest proposed dredging site. Given that many of these threats are still in the planning stage, we advise the government to consider the negative effects these activities have already had on other riverine species before proceeding. Additionally, efforts should be made to expand river dolphin tracking programmes to span multiple seasons, to track more females at our study sites and to increase the numbers tracked overall in other areas to improve our knowledge of the species' movement patterns.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Ganges Dolphin needs uninterrupted water sources in order to both communicate and to locate its food. Ever-increasing activities in the rivers, especially from motorized vessels, are likely to add noise to the soundscape used by this animal and may affect its ability to locate its prey or to sense its environment. Although efforts have been made to improve the quality and flow of the water passing through the Ganga River system, a coordinated effort among policymakers, local implementing authorities, researchers, and funding agencies is needed to achieve the desired goal of restoring the habitat of dolphins, stopping their accidental deaths, increasing their number by captive breeding, and reinstating the biodiversity of aquatic organisms that are passively or actively linked to them. While passive restoration plans such as improving water quality, increasing water volume, and habitat reclamation may work well, the developmental needs along the river exert constant pressure on these plans. These plans may not be effective without the strict enforcement of guidelines, an understanding of the requirements of the plans by all the stakeholders, and the awareness of the population living along the rivers. Therefore, conservation efforts, along with ongoing passive restoration processes aimed at improving the dolphin's living ecosystem by providing enough quality water cover and prey, should focus on increasing the population of these animals by propagating them in captivity through biological or biotechnological means, the success of which needs strong scientific research backing. A scientometric analysis of 20 years (2001-2020) on this animal shows that scientific studies are confined to the ecology of the animals and very little is known either of their biology or their genetics. During the study period, India occupied fourth spot in number of publications on river dolphins, with the Indian Institute of Technology as leading institute. Advance biology techniques may allow us to breed the animal in captivity and even clone the animal. However, the research towards this requires creating the necessary basic infrastructure, funding, and policy support, and developing human resources for research and management. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc..

ABSTRACT: Cetacean mixed-species groups are common around the world, but little is known about how and why they occur. Tursiops truncatus (Common Bottlenose Dolphin) and Stenella frontalis (Atlantic Spotted Dolphin) are delphinidae species that have been sighted, separately, along the southeast coast of Florida. Although these species are observed interacting together in other portions of their range, this is the first report of a known mixed-species group of Atlantic Spotted Dolphins and Common Bottlenose Dolphins off the southeast Florida coast. We observed both foraging and social behaviors using a DJI Mavic Pro 2 drone. The function of mixed-species groups is understudied, yet Florida may provide opportunities for future research. © 2023 Humboldt Field Research Institute. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphin is a species at the top of the food chain, but its population is currently endangered. Hence, the critical need to take effective conservation measures for Irrawaddy dolphins, particularly in population reproduction. The age structure of Irrawaddy dolphins can be studied to understand the population reproduction status and provide reference for formulating scientific conservation measures. Unlike age estimation methods based on invasive biological tissue detection and individual biological target detection methods based on audio features or image pixel features, this paper proposes the method to extract the Irrawaddy dolphin's dorsal fin geometric morphological features for classifying age-groups by using non-uniform B-spline. Firstly, this method uses non-uniform B-spline method to fit the dorsal fin edge curve of Irrawaddy dolphins. Then the curve is resolved to extract its derivatives, curvature and other features that describe its geometry morphology. Finally, the random forest (RF) was supplemented to classify Irrawaddy dolphins into juvenile, middle-aged and older. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper could effectively classify older dolphins to an accuracy of 87.36%. The method proposed in this paper is non-invasive not only can help analyze the Irrawaddy dolphin's development trajectory, understand the reproductive maturity, fecundity rates, and survival rates, but also can help understand the changes of the regional ecological environment and protect the aquatic diversity. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Nepal is a land-linked country relatively small in area. However, it is home to several rivers, and these rivers are undoubtedly beautiful additions to the mountainous nation's splendid scenic landscape. Most of Nepal's surface water drains through the three major rivers are Saptakoshi, Narayani, and Karnali. Mechi and Mahakali Rivers and their tributaries mark the international boundaries between Nepal and India. All of these originate either from the Himalayas or from the Tibet Plateau and are perennial. However, dams and other water development projects, intensive fishing, pollution, and extensive human disturbances have decreased the abundance of the Ganges River Dolphin, which is now restricted only to the Koshi and Karnali River systems and in an isolated form. The first Integrated Dolphin Census of Nepal, conducted in 2016, recorded 52 dolphins throughout the country. Of the 52 dolphins, 43 were sighted in the Mohana of Karnali and its tributaries. No dolphins have been recorded recently for the Mahakali river, and sightings in the Narayani river, are occasional. The population of the River Dolphins is declining at an alarming rate. Therefore, it is important to regularly assess the status and trends of their populations and design strategies for their conservation and sustainable use. . © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc..

ABSTRACT: Given growing interest in emulating dolphin morphology and kinematics to design high-performance underwater vehicles, the current research effort is dedicated to studying the hydrodynamics of dolphin-like oscillatory kinematics in forward propulsion. A computational fluid dynamics method is used. A realistic three-dimentional surface model of a dolphin is made with swimming kinematics reconstructed from video recording. The oscillation of the dolphin is found to enhance the attachment of the boundary layer to the posterior body, which then leads to body drag reduction. The flapping motion of the flukes is found to generate high thrust forces in both the downstroke and the upstroke, during which vortex rings are shed to produce strong thrust jets. The downstroke jets are found to be on average stronger than the upstroke jet, which then leads to net positive lift production. The flexion of the peduncle and flukes is found to be a crucial feature of dolphin-like swimming kinematics. Dolphin-inspired swimming kinematics were created by varying the flexion angle of the peduncle and flukes, which then resulted in significant performance variation. The thrust benefits and propulsive efficiency benefits are associated with a slight decrease and slight increase of the flexion of the peduncle and flukes, respectively. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Parallel evolution provides strong evidence of adaptation by natural selection due to local environmental variation. Yet, the chronology, and mode of the process of parallel evolution remains debated. Here, we harness the temporal resolution of paleogenomics to address these long-standing questions, by comparing genomes originating from the mid-Holocene (8610-5626 years before present, BP) to contemporary pairs of coastal-pelagic ecotypes of bottlenose dolphin. We find that the affinity of ancient samples to coastal populations increases as the age of the samples decreases. We assess the youngest genome (5626 years BP) at sites previously inferred to be under parallel selection to coastal habitats and find it contained coastal-associated genotypes. Thus, coastal-associated variants rose to detectable frequencies close to the emergence of coastal habitat. Admixture graph analyses reveal a reticulate evolutionary history between pelagic and coastal populations, sharing standing genetic variation that facilitated rapid adaptation to newly emerged coastal habitats. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Interactions between bottlenose dolphin and recreational rod and reel fisheries are a complex issue for resource managers in the United States, which may impact anglers' catch and lead to dangerous situations for scavenging or depredating dolphins. To examine this issue, we analyzed data collected by observers on for-hire fishing vessels off the eastern U.S. Gulf Coast from 2009 to 2020. A generalized additive model indicated number of anglers, number of discarded fish, proximity to shore, prior scavenging events, type of released fish, and area fished were all significant predictors of scavenging by dolphins. The Florida panhandle had the highest odds of scavenging, while scavenging in the Big Bend and Tampa Bay has increased through time. The Florida panhandle is a well-known area for illegal feeding of dolphins, suggesting human behavior may be influencing fisheries interactions. Model outputs indicate that dolphins are primarily cuing on fishing activity rather than number of discards, but are more likely to scavenge discards from the family Lutjanidae (snappers), which comprised 40% of observed discards but 80% of scavenging events. This study highlights factors influencing the frequency of dolphin scavenging events, guiding managers and scientists on additional studies and mitigation measures needed to address this issue. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: The advent of the 2019 Corona virus impacted day-To day human activities and the nationwide lockdown in India completely paralyzed life (midnight of 24thMarch, to 31stJune, 2020). However, this complete halt of human activity allowed the Ganga ecosystem to realise its maximum self-purification potential, resulting in the improvement of flow regime, water quality and over all restoration of the river. The most common manifestation of restoration of an aquatic ecosystem is zooplankton community structure; i.e. relative proportion of various functional feeding groups. The present study compares selected water quality parameters (DO, BOD, pH, Total coliform, Fecal coliform), and zooplankton community structure estimated during the lockdown period with the values recorded for the same period in previous three years at dolphin appearing site near Kalighat, (25° 37′ 19.398″ N; 85° 9′ 55.8972″ E), middle of the Patna city and Mittal Ghat (downstream site of the Patna City) at Gurhatta (25° 36′24.5772″ N; 85° 13′ 1.6788″ E). During each sampling, the dolphin emergence site and frequency were monitored for three hours duration. Monthly zooplankton samples were collected at both the sites using a 53 μm mesh size plankton net beginning January 2018 by filtering 45-50 l of river water. Zooplankton were identified and segregated based on functional feeding groups. The values of dissolved oxygen were significantly higher, whereas that of BOD level, total coliform and total fecal coliform were lower during the lockdown period than those in previous years. Detailed analyses revealed that relative proportions of Cladocera were significantly higher, whereas that of bacterivorous Rotifera were significantly lower than the previous values of the same months. The highly indicator species at both the sampling sites was Moina micrura during March-May 2020; in previous years it was Brachionus rotifers 8.8 (ind l-1) at Kalighat and Moina micrura (15 ind l-1) at Gurhatta. Our results suggest that during the lockdown the dolphin appearing sites at both stations shifted towards the riverbank whereas, zooplankton community structure changed towards algaevorous Cladocera without affecting overall species richness. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc..

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a top marine predator widely dispersed in coastal and pelagic habitats and with a generalist feeding behavior. Yet, information on the trophic ecology of animals inhabiting pelagic environments is still scarce. Using carbon (δ13C: 13C/12C) and nitrogen (δ15N: 15N/14N) stable isotope ratios, we identified and quantified the main groups of prey assimilated by bottlenose dolphins inhabiting an oceanic habitat (Madeira Island, East Atlantic). Bottlenose dolphins assimilated pelagic, schooling fish (such as blue jack mackerel, Trachurus picturatus) and mesopelagic and demersal squids, which reinforces the pelagic dietary composition of insular/oceanic dolphins. Also, intra-seasonal differences were found in their stable isotope ratios, which suggest intraspecific variability in the feeding behavior among individuals living in the same area. Sex was not the main factor contributing to these differences, suggesting the lack of trophic niche segregation between adult males and females in this offshore environment. Nonetheless, further studies including different life stages and information on the ecophysiological requirements are necessary to disclose the factors responsible for the observed variability. This study showed that insular dolphins fed primarily on economically important pelagic prey, highlighting the need of developing management strategies that integrate conservation in fisheries plans. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: There is a need to understand the links between metals and nutrition for apex marine predators, which may be subject to different ecotoxicological effects at different life stages. We combined stomach content analyses (SCA), prey composition analysis (PCA), the Multidimensional Niche Framework (MNNF) with Bayesian multivariate ellipses, trace metal analysis and nicheROVER to investigate nutrition and trace metals across sex, age, and sexual maturity status in common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) from New Zealand. A broader prey composition niche breadth (SEAc) was estimated for immature compared to mature conspecifics, showing a higher degree of prey and nutrient generalism driven by protein (P) intake. Cd and Zn niche similarities suggests these metals were incorporated through similar prey in both immature and mature dolphins, whereas Hg and Se niche divergence indicates uptake occurred via different prey. Our multidisciplinary assessment demonstrated how nutrients and metal interactions differ in common dolphins depending upon sexual maturity. This approach has relevance when considering how marine pollution, environmental fluctuations and climate change may affect nutritional and trace metal interactions during different reproductive stages within marine predators. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the second-most bycaught species in Korean waters. To provide key information about their habitat boundaries and hotspots for spatial conservation and management, the spatial use of this species was examined using data obtained from sighting and bycatch surveys of cetaceans in the past 20 years. The 95% minimum convex polygon and 95% density contour of fixed-kernel analysis suggested that the boundary of the home range of common dolphins is limited to the coastal region (Busan–Sokcho) of the East Sea/Sea of Japan. From 50% density contours drawn by kernel density estimation, it was suggested that their hotspots are around the coast of Ulsan–Pohang, Doghae, and Sokcho within the home range. Common dolphins were not observed in the Yellow Sea. Hence, shallow waters in the geographic area of the coastal region of the Yellow Sea are likely not a suitable habitat for common dolphins in this region. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) was once found in tens of thousands in the rivers of the Indian sub-continent, but the numbers have now dwindled abysmally throughout its geographical distribution. In northeastern India too, dolphins were seen in all the major rivers and also in certain wetlands during monsoon months till the early 1980s. However, the sighting of dolphins is rare now due to natural and human-induced factors. Three factors-adequate water cover, water quality, and abundance of prey food either individually or in combination-relate to River Dolphins' existence. Variability of meteorological parameters also severely impacts on the limno-biological parameters of riverine habitats. Restoration of Gangetic Dolphins in their traditional habitats can boost ecotourism in the region. An extensive study is necessary to assess the cumulative impact of the proposed hydroelectric projects on the aquatic biodiversity of the entire eastern Himalayan region. The need of the hour is to adopt a holistic and participatory approach for maintaining riverine health and the prey base of the Barak and the Brahmaputra systems. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc..

ABSTRACT: To understand the scope and scale of the loss of biodiversity, tools are required that can be applied in a standardized manner to all species globally, spanning realms from land to the open ocean. We used data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List to provide a synthesis of the conservation status and extinction risk of cetaceans. One in 4 cetacean species (26% of 92 species) was threatened with extinction (i.e., critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable) and 11% were near threatened. Ten percent of cetacean species were data deficient, and we predicted that 2–3 of these species may also be threatened. The proportion of threatened cetaceans has increased: 15% in 1991, 19% in 2008, and 26% in 2021. The assessed conservation status of 20% of species has worsened from 2008 to 2021, and only 3 moved into categories of lesser threat. Cetacean species with small geographic ranges were more likely to be listed as threatened than those with large ranges, and those that occur in freshwater (100% of species) and coastal (60% of species) habitats were under the greatest threat. Analysis of odontocete species distributions revealed a global hotspot of threatened small cetaceans in Southeast Asia, in an area encompassing the Coral Triangle and extending through nearshore waters of the Bay of Bengal, northern Australia, and Papua New Guinea and into the coastal waters of China. Improved management of fisheries to limit overfishing and reduce bycatch is urgently needed to avoid extinctions or further declines, especially in coastal areas of Asia, Africa, and South America. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: A wide variety of lesions have been associated with herpesvirus in cetaceans. However, descriptions of herpesvirus infections in the digestive system of cetaceans are scarce. Case report: A young female striped dolphin stranded in the Valencian Community (Spain) on the 6th August 2021. The animal showed external macroscopic lesions suggestive of an aggressive interaction with bottlenose dolphins (rake marks in the epidermis). Internally, the main findings included congestion of the central nervous system and multiple, well-defined, whitish, irregularly shaped, proliferative lesions on the oropharyngeal and laryngopharyngeal mucosa. Histopathology revealed lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic meningoencephalitis, consistent with neuro brucellosis. The oropharyngeal and laryngopharyngeal plaques were comprised histologically of focally extensive epithelial hyperplasia. As part of the health surveillance program tissue samples were tested for cetacean morbillivirus using a real-time reverse transcription-PCR, for Brucella spp. using a real-time PCR, and for herpesvirus using a conventional nested PCR. All samples were negative for cetacean morbillivirus; molecular positivity for Brucella spp. was obtained in pharyngeal tonsils and cerebrospinal fluid; herpesvirus was detected in a proliferative lesion in the upper digestive mucosa. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the herpesvirus sequence was included in the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. This novel sequence showed the greatest identity with other Herpesvirus sequences detected in skin, pharyngeal and genital lesions in five different species. Conclusions: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of a proliferative lesion in the upper digestive mucosa associated with gammaherpesvirus posititvity in a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Bycatch of common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) in commercial trawl fisheries in the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic) is of concern and its mitigation a priority. Active acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) attached to fishing gear seem to be promising for bycatch mitigation, as they have demonstrated to effectively reduce cetacean bycatch in some set-net fisheries. However, the low occurrence of common dolphin bycatch in many trawl fisheries, coupled with the extensive amount of time needed to monitor them, makes it difficult to prove the effectiveness of pingers. Remote electronic monitoring (REM) systems in fisheries can substantially increase onboard observation, providing access to extensive databases to comprehensively address bycatch mitigation studies. In this study, the effectiveness of DDD®03H Dolphin Dissuasive Device (hereinafter DDD pingers) to reduce common dolphin bycatch was evaluated in a demersal pair trawler in FAO Division 27.8.c. In 195 fishing days, one of the vessels in the pair operated with a set of DDD pingers whereas the other operated without them, and the bycatch of common dolphin was monitored through the REM system. In total, 660 fishing hauls were conducted of which 223 hauls had the DDDs attached. The results showed that the DDDs reduced common dolphin bycatch by more than 90%, with both bycatch frequency and the number of individuals bycaught per haul being significantly lower. The results also showed that common dolphin bycatch in this fishery is related to factors such as the fishing zone and depth, whereas the type of net deployed, time of day and haul duration were found to not significantly affect the bycatch of this species. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are known for their complex vocal communication, not least because of their capacity for acoustic plasticity. Paradoxically, we know little about their capacity for flexible vocal use. The difficulty in describing the behaviours performed underwater while vocalizing makes it difficult to analyse the contexts of emissions. Dolphins’ main vocal categories are typically considered to be used for scanning the environment (clicks), agonistic encounters (burst pulses) and socio-affiliative interactions (whistles). Dolphins can also combine these categories in mixed vocal emissions, whose use remains unclear. To better understand how vocalizations are used, we simultaneously recorded vocal production and the associated behaviours by conducting underwater observations (N = 479 events) on a group of 7 bottlenose dolphins under human care. Our results showed a non-random association between vocal categories and behavioural contexts. Precisely, clicks were preferentially emitted during affiliative interactions and not during other social/solitary contexts, supporting a possible complementary communicative function. Burst pulses were associated to high arousal contexts (agonistic and social play), pinpointing on their use as an “emotively charged” signal. Whistles were related to solitary swimming and not preferentially produced in any social context. This questions whistles’ functions and supports their potential role as a distant contact call. Finally, mixed vocalizations were especially found associated with sexual (bust pulse-whistle-click), solitary play (burst pulse-whistle) and affiliative (click-whistle) behaviours. Depending on the case, their emission seems to confirm, modify or refine the functions of their simple counterparts. These results open up new avenues of research into the contextual use of dolphin acoustic signals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Shipping is the principal source of anthropogenic noise in the aquatic soundscape of many coastal areas. Noise can affect temporally or permanently the physiology, behavior, and ecology of marine mammals. As noise pollution is considered to be an important threat to Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis), we focused the present study in the effects of noise on occurrence and acoustic behavior in Sepetiba Bay, southeastern Brazil. We modeled the impacts of anthropogenic noise on the acoustic behavior and distribution of these dolphins in an estuarine area. We considered the acoustic parameters (maximum frequency, minimum frequency, delta frequency, duration of whistles, and whistle rates) and occurrence of Guiana dolphins as the response variables and sound exposure levels (SEL) and environmental factors (sea surface temperature, depth, bottom heterogeneity, and bottom type) as the explanatory variables. While dolphin occurrence was explained by environmental variables, mainly SST, the whistle rate was explained by SEL (contribution = 52.4%). The dolphins used noisier areas but communicated mainly in less noisy areas. Although the dolphins did not appear to avoid the noisiest areas, noise levels were the most important variable to explain the reduction in whistle rates. Our results are particularly important since they indicate the effects of noise on an endangered species living in a region with high cumulative impacts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In September 2020, a male common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) was found dead on a beach near Bat-Yam, Israel. A small, raised, well circumscribed penile lesion (i.e., mass) was identified and removed for histology and molecular characterizations. By histology, the penile mass presented focal keratinization of the squamous epithelium and a mild ballooning of acanthocytes in lower epithelium levels, as well as features compatible with viral plaques, and tested positive for a gammaherpesvirus through molecular characterization analyses. Tissue samples from the lungs, liver, and spleen, however, tested negative for herpesvirus infection. The gammaherpesvirus detected herein is similar to other isolates found in several areas worldwide in different cetacean species. This is the first reported case of gammaherpesvirus infection in dolphins from the eastern Mediterranean Sea, indicative of the need for long-term assessments to create viral infections databases in cetaceans, especially in a climate change context, which is likely to intensify infectious disease outbreaks in marine mammals in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: A novel framework for acoustic detection and species identification is proposed to aid passive acoustic monitoring studies on the endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) in South African waters. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used for both detection and identification of dolphin vocalisations tasks, and performance was evaluated using custom and pre-trained architectures (transfer learning). In total, 723 min of acoustic data were annotated for the presence of whistles, burst pulses and echolocation clicks produced by Delphinus delphis (~45.6%), Tursiops aduncus (~39%), Sousa plumbea (~14.4%), Orcinus orca (~1%). The best performing models for detecting dolphin presence and species identification used segments (spectral windows) of two second lengths and were trained using images with 70 and 90 dpi, respectively. The best detection model was built using a customised architecture and achieved an accuracy of 84.4% for all dolphin vocalisations on the test set, and 89.5% for vocalisations with a high signal to noise ratio. The best identification model was also built using the customised architecture and correctly identified S. plumbea (96.9%), T. aduncus (100%), and D. delphis (78%) encounters in the testing dataset. The developed framework was designed based on the knowledge of complex dolphin sounds and it may assists in finding suitable CNN hyper-parameters for other species or populations. Our study contributes towards the development of an open-source tool to assist long-term studies of endangered species, living in highly diverse habitats, using passive acoustic monitoring. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Social behaviours can allow individuals to flexibly respond to environmental change, potentially buffering adverse effects. However, individuals may respond differently to the same environmental stimulus, complicating predictions for population-level response to environmental change. Here, we show that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) alter their social behaviour at yearly and monthly scales in response to a proxy for food availability (salmon abundance) but do not respond to variation in a proxy for climate (the North Atlantic Oscillation index). There was also individual variation in plasticity for gregariousness and connectedness to distant parts of the social network, although these traits showed limited repeatability. By contrast, individuals showed consistent differences in clustering with their immediate social environment at the yearly scale but no individual variation in plasticity for this trait at either timescale. These results indicate that social behaviour in free-ranging cetaceans can be highly resource dependent with individuals increasing their connectedness over short timescales but possibly reducing their wider range of connection at longer timescales. Some social traits showed more individual variation in plasticity or mean behaviour than others, highlighting how predictions for the responses of populations to environmental variation must consider the type of individual variation present in the population.  © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Populations of many coastal cetaceans are threatened by negative anthropogenic impacts. Key precursors to effective recovery plans include understanding life histories and population parameters to establish baselines for subsequent changes. Here, we provide this information for one of the largest populations of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis), in the Paranaguá estuarine complex (PEC), southern Brazil. Between 2014–2015 and 2017–2018, photo-identification data were collected from vessels at two locations bordering a (i) marine conservation zone and (ii) port area in the PEC to estimate population parameters via mark-recapture modeling. Group sizes varied between 1 and 41 animals at both locations, and a Jolly–Seber mark-recapture model estimated total abundances to be 454 (95% CI = 287–718) and 902 individuals (95% CI = 652–1247), respectively. Calves were identified in 62% and 71% of groups. There was also location-specific variability among the probabilities of capture (0.43; 95% CI = 0.21–0.67 vs 0.94; 95% CI = 0.91–0.96) survival (0.77; 95% CI = 0.31–0.95 vs 0.26; 95% CI = 0.23–0.30) and individuals entering populations (0.00–0.23 vs 0.00–0.26). These differences were attributed to various geographic and anthropogenic factors in the PEC. By providing regional baseline abundance of Guiana dolphin population dynamics and their spatio-temporal use, this study supports future local assessments of population trends, and facilitates broader between-population comparisons for better assessing population risks and the conservation status of the species. Collectively, the results reinforce the need for (i) existing regional protected areas, and (ii) ongoing systematic surveys to inform managing anthropogenic activities along the southern Brazilian coast, and other areas with multiple and cumulative impacts on coastal dolphins. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: The last decade has witnessed dramatic improvements in whole-genome sequencing capabilities coupled to drastically decreased costs, leading to an inundation of high-quality de novo genomes. For this reason, the continued development of genome quality metrics is imperative. Using the 2016 Atlantic bottlenose dolphin NCBI RefSeq annotation and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of six tissues, we confirmed 10,402 proteins from 4711 protein groups, constituting nearly one-third of the possible predicted proteins. Since the identification of larger proteins with more identified peptides implies reduced database fragmentation and improved gene annotation accuracy, we propose the metric NP10, which attempts to capture this quality improvement. The NP10 metric is calculated by first stratifying proteomic results by identifying the top decile (or 10th 10-quantile) of identified proteins based on the number of peptides per protein and then returns the median molecular weight of the resulting proteins. When using the 2016 versus 2012 Tursiops truncatus genome annotation to search this proteomic data set, there was a 21% improvement in NP10. This metric was further demonstrated by using a publicly available proteomic data set to compare human genome annotations from 2004, 2013 and 2016, which showed a 33% improvement in NP10. These results demonstrate that proteomics may be a useful metrological tool to benchmark genome accuracy, though there is a need for reference proteomic datasets across species to facilitate the evaluation of new de novo and existing genome. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Biological fish can always sense the state of water flow and regulate the angle of attack in time, so as to maintain the highest movement efficiency during periodic flapping. The biological adjustment of the caudal fin’s angle of attack (AoA) depends on the contraction/relaxation of the tail muscles, accompanying the variation in tail stiffness. During an interaction with external fluid, it helps to maintain the optimal angle of attack during movement, to improve the propulsion performance. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a tail joint motion control scheme based on AoA feedback for the high-speed swimming of bionic dolphins. Firstly, the kinematic characteristics of the designed robot dolphin are analyzed, and the hardware basis is clarified. Second, aiming at the deficiency of the tail motor, which cannot effectively cooperate with the waist joint motor during high-frequency movement, a compensation model for the friction force and latex skin-restoring force is designed, and a joint angle control algorithm based on fuzzy inference is proposed to realize the tracking of the desired joint angle for the tail joint in torque mode. In addition, a tail joint closed-loop control scheme based on angle of attack feedback is proposed to improve the motion performance. Finally, experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed motion control scheme. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study is to assess the natural resources and radiological risks of Wadi El Gemal Island by examining its topography, mineralogy, geochemistry, and radioactive distributions. This island, which is situated at the outlet of Wadi El Gemal in Egypt's southeastern Desert, has a unique shape resembling a dolphin based on Landsat imagery. It's a part of the Wadi El Gemal-Hamata Protectorate and is notable for its diverse environmental, geological, economic, and archeological features, including recent reefs, sandy deposits, Quaternary carbonate sediments, and mangroves. The main natural resources on the island are fauna, mangrove forests, and flora. Samples collected from the island were analyzed using a NaI detector to measure the concentrations of radionuclides such as 238U, 232Th, 226Ra, and 40K, which were found to be within acceptable levels according to UNSCAR guidelines. The radionuclide 238U, 232Th, 226Ra, and 40K activity concentrations of the collected samples were 32.55 ± 9, 12.63 ± 4, 12.49 ± 4, and 325 ± 34 Bq/kg, respectively. Regarding radiological hazard indices, the values of absorbed gamma dose rate (36.06 ± 5.42 nGy/h), radium equivalent activity (73.88 ± 14.4 Bq/kg), annual effective dose indoor (0.18 ± 0.03 mSv/y) and outdoor (0.04 ± 0.01 mSv/y), internal (0.29 ± 0.05) and external (0.2 ± 0.03) indices, and excess lifetime cancer index (0.15 ± 0.05 × 10−3).This is suggest that there is no significant risk associated with these sediments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: For the two dolphin species Sotalia guianensis (Guiana dolphin) and Tursiops truncatus (bottlenose dolphin), previous research has shown that the vibrissal crypts located on the rostrum represent highly innervated, ampullary electroreceptors and that both species are correspondingly sensitive to weak electric fields. In the present study, for a comparative assessment of the sensitivity of the bottlenose dolphin's electroreceptive system, we determined detection thresholds for DC and AC electric fields with two bottlenose dolphins. In a psychophysical experiment, the animals were trained to respond to electric field stimuli using the go/no-go paradigm. We show that the two bottlenose dolphins are able to detect DC electric fields as low as 2.4 and 5.5 µV cm−1, respectively, a detection threshold in the same order of magnitude as those in the platypus and the Guiana dolphin. Detection thresholds for AC fields (1, 5 and 25 Hz) were generally higher than those for DC fields, and the sensitivity for AC fields decreased with increasing frequency. Although the electroreceptive sensitivity of dolphins is lower than that of elasmobranchs, it is suggested that it allows for both micro- and macro-scale orientation. In dolphins pursuing benthic foraging strategies, electroreception may facilitate short-range prey detection and target-oriented snapping of their prey. Furthermore, the ability to detect weak electric fields may enable dolphins to perceive the Earth's magnetic field through induction-based magnetoreception, thus allowing large-scale orientation. © 2023 Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The early diverging, dolphin-sized, cetacean clade Xenorophidae are a short-lived radiation of toothed whales (Odontoceti) that independently evolved two features long thought to be odontocete synapomorphies: the craniofacial and cochlear morphology underlying echolocation and retrograde cranial telescoping (i.e., posterior migration of the viscerocranium). This family was based on Xenorophus sloanii, which, for the past century, has been known only by a partial skull lacking a braincase and tympanoperiotics, collected around 1900 from the Ashley Formation (28–29 Ma, Rupelian) near Ladson, South Carolina. A large collection of new skulls and skeletons (ChM PV 5022, 7677; CCNHM 104, 168, 1077, 5995) from the Ashley Formation considerably expands the hypodigm for this species, now the best known of any stem odontocete and permitting evaluation of intraspecific variation and ontogenetic changes. This collection reveals that the holotype (USNM 11049) is a juvenile. Xenorophus sloanii is a relatively large odontocete (70–74 cm CBL; BZW = 29–31 cm; estimated body length 2.6–3 m) with a moderately long rostrum (RPI = 2.5), marked heterodonty, limited polydonty (13–14 teeth), prominent sagittal crest and intertemporal constriction, and drastically larger brain size than basilosaurid archaeocetes (EQ = 2.9). Dental morphology, thickened cementum, a dorsoventrally robust rostrum, and thick rugose enamel suggest raptorial feeding; oral pathology indicates traumatic tooth loss associated with mechanically risky predation attempts. Ontogenetic changes include increased palatal vomer exposure; fusion of the nasofrontal, occipito-parietal, and median frontal sutures; anterior lengthening of the nasals; elaboration of the nuchal crests; and blunting and thickening of the antorbital process. The consistent deviation of the rostrum 2–5° to the left and asymmetry of the palate, dentition, neurocranium, mandibles, and vertebrae in multiple specimens of Xenorophus sloanii suggest novel adaptations for directional hearing driven by the asymmetrically oriented pan bones of the mandibles. A second collection consisting of a skeleton and several skulls from the overlying Chandler Bridge Formation (24–23 Ma, Chattian) represents a new species, Xenorophus simplicidens n. sp., differing from Xenorophus sloanii in possessing shorter nasals, anteroposteriorly shorter supraorbital processes of the frontal, and teeth with fewer accessory cusps and less rugose enamel. Phylogenetic analysis supports monophyly of Xenorophus, with specimens of Xenorophus simplicidens nested within paraphyletic X. sloanii; in concert with stratigraphic data, these results support the interpretation of these species as part of an anagenetic lineage. New clade names are provided for the sister taxon to Xenorophidae (Ambyloccipita), and the odontocete clade excluding Xenorophidae, Ashleycetus, Mirocetus, and Simocetidae (Stegoceti). Analyses of tooth size, body size, temporal fossa length, orbit morphology, and the rostral proportion index, prompted by well-preserved remains of Xenorophus, provide insight into the early evolution of Odontoceti. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A dolphin’s signature whistle (SW) is a distinctive acoustic signal, issued in a bout pattern of unique frequency modulation contours; it allows individuals belonging to a given group to recognize each other and, consequently, to maintain contact and cohesion. The current study is the first scientific evidence that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) produce SWs. Acoustic data were recorded at a shallow rest bay called “Biboca”, in Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil. In total, 1902 whistles were analyzed; 40% (753/1,902) of them were classified as stereotyped whistles (STW). Based on the SIGID method, 63% (472/753) of all STWs were identified as SWs; subsequently, they were categorized into one of 18 SW types. SWs accounted for 25% (472/1,902) of the acoustic repertoire. External observers have shown near perfect agreement to classify whistles into the adopted SW categorization. Most acoustic and temporal variables measured for SWs showed mean values similar to those recorded in other studies with spinner dolphins, whose authors did not differentiate SWs from non-SWs. Principal component analysis has explained 78% of total SW variance, and it emphasized the relevance of shape/contour and frequency variables to SW variance. This scientific discovery helps improving bioacoustics knowledge about the investigated species. Future studies to be conducted in Fernando de Noronha Archipelago should focus on continuous investigations about SW development and use by S. longirostris, expanding individuals’ identifications (Photo ID and SW Noronha Catalog), assessing long-term whistle stability and emission rates, and making mother–offspring comparisons with sex-based differences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Nepal is endowed with vast water resources in form of glaciers, lakes, streams and rivers. All the rivers in Nepal are connected to the Ganges River system of India. The major rivers are reliable sources of water and provide habitats for aquatic animals, opportunities for hydropower, and irrigation development in downstream regions. The major rivers of Nepal include the Koshi, Gandaki (Narayani), Karnali, and Mahakali which all drain from north to south. These rivers support abundant wildlife species as well as a number of fishes, amphibians and reptiles. Most relevant to this paper is the Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica Roxburgh, 1801). The Ganges River Dolphin preys on fish, mollusks and other aquatic animals. Being a migratory species, the dolphins move from larger rivers to their tributaries, seasonally. This paper is intended to review work on the status of Ganges River Dolphin in Nepalese rivers based on secondary data obtained from different published surveys targeting the dolphin populations. The records show the Karnali River has the largest population, followed by the Koshi and Narayani rivers, with no record of dolphins occupying the Mahakali River in recent years. Recent surveys estimate about 100 dolphins living in Nepal, with 80 estimated in the Karnali River. Different anthropogenic activities including construction work, intensive fishing, pollution and the lack of conservation planning for dolphins have resulted in a decline in number from historic levels. The presence of this aquatic mammal is considered as an indicator of the overall health of the river system. The COVID-19 pandemic and lock down might have caused increased dolphin sightings. Additionally, high pre-monsoon precipitation in recent years have caused higher water levels in smaller rivers, possibly causing the dolphins to return earlier than usual to the major river systems. They were recorded to be present in the Mohana and other small tributaries of the Karnali River as early as first week of June. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Different tissues are used for stable isotope analysis in cetacean investigations. However, variation in the isotopic composition of tissues with different turnover rates has been reported for cetaceans. To better understand stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) in skin compared to other tissues, this study assessed the isotopic variation among the liver, muscle, and skin of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis), as well as the influence of sex on these variations. No differences were found in δ13C among male tissues, but females showed lower values in the liver compared to muscle and skin. Differences in δ15N were observed among all tissues, with different variation patterns for males and females. Four females were distinguished from males and other females by their 13C depletion in all tissues and δ15N variation pattern. We conclude that skin and muscle may be equivalent in δ13C values for Guiana dolphins. The multiple-tissue analysis brings new insights into their feeding ecology and provides background for stable isotope analysis using non-destructive sampling techniques in small cetaceans. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Numerous studies have demonstrated the negative effects of impoverished environments versus the positive effects of enriched environments on animals’ cognitive and neural functioning. Recently, a hypothesis was raised suggesting that conditions for dolphins in zoological facilities may be inherently impoverished, and thus lead to neural and cognitive deficits. This review directly examines that hypothesis in light of the existing scientific literature relevant to dolphin welfare in zoological facilities. Specifically, it examines how dolphins are housed in modern zoological facilities, where the characteristics of such housing fall on the continuum of impoverished-to-enriched environments, and the extent to which dolphins show behavioral evidence characteristic of living in impoverished environments. The results of this analysis show that contrary to the original hypothesis, modern zoological facilities do not inherently, or even typically, house dolphins in impoverished conditions. However, it also notes that there is variation in animal welfare across different zoological facilities, and that “not impoverished” would be a particularly low bar to set as an animal welfare standard. To optimize cognitive well-being, strategies for providing additional cognitive challenges for dolphins in zoological facilities are suggested. © 2023 by the author.

ABSTRACT: The presence of ultraviolet filters (UVFs) and stabilizers (UVSs) was evaluated for the first time in the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). UVFs and UVSs are compounds of growing concern because their effects on the environment are not completely known. UVFs and UVSs are added to personal care products (PCPs), such as cosmetics and products related to sun care and once released to the aquatic ecosystem, marine organisms can bioaccumulate these substances. This work aimed to determine the presence of 12 UVFs and UVSs in cetacean blubber samples to assess the pollution to which these animals of the highest trophic chain levels are exposed due to human activity. Analytical determinations were carried out using a method based on microwave-assisted extraction combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry detection. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the target compounds in the blubber tissues of five necropsied common bottlenose dolphins. Three of the 12 studied compounds, namely 2-ethylhexyl 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylprop-2-enoate (octocrilene, OC), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (benzophenone 3, BP3) and 3-methylbutyl (E)-3-(4methoxyphenyl) prop-2-enoate (IMC), were detected in several samples. Of the identified compounds, OC was present in all the samples and at the highest concentration within the range from 52.61 ± 18.59 to 108.0 ± 11.32 ng·g−1. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This paper introduces the inaugural rapid evaluation of river dolphin habitats, coinciding with managed sites in Asia and South America. Covering all six river dolphin species (including the sole freshwater porpoise worldwide), each is classified as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The Conservation Assured | River Dolphin Standards (CA|RDS) offer tailored guidelines for the proficient oversight of protected areas for river dolphins. The abbreviated CA|RDS version, termed CA|RDS Lite, involves a questionnaire-based survey conducted by managers and stakeholders at 40 sites across 10 of the 14 countries within the river dolphin range. Both continents face river dolphin endangerment from fishing and climate change. In Asia, risks are more diverse, with smaller populations compared to South America. Insufficient funding and management capacity emerge as significant hurdles. Inadequate collaboration with areas outside the protected area boundary impedes effective river dolphin population management. Encouragingly, the survey highlights active involvement of local communities and stakeholders in site management. CA|RDS Lite offers a quick overview of site management efficacy, pinpointing crucial management requirements and urgent river dolphin sites necessitating intervention. It also sets the stage for the complete application of CA|RDS standards and their use as an accreditation and management instrument. © 2023, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

ABSTRACT: The age of an individual is an essential demographic parameter but is difficult to estimate without long-term monitoring or invasive sampling. Epigenetic approaches are increasingly used to age organisms, including nonmodel organisms such as cetaceans. Māui dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) are a critically endangered subspecies endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand, and the age structure of this population is important for informing conservation. Here we present an epigenetic clock for aging Māui and Hector's dolphins (C. h. hectori) developed from methylation data using DNA from tooth aged individuals (n = 48). Based on this training data set, the optimal model required only eight methylation sites, provided an age correlation of.95, and had a median absolute age error of 1.54 years. A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis with the same parameters resulted in an age correlation of.87 and median absolute age error of 2.09 years. To improve age estimation, we included previously published beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) data to develop a joint beluga/dolphin clock, resulting in a clock with comparable performance and improved estimation of older individuals. Application of the models to DNA from skin biopsy samples of living Māui dolphins revealed a shift from a median age of 8–9 years to a younger population aged 7–8 years 10 years later. These models could be applied to other dolphin species and demonstrate the ability to construct a clock even when the number of known age samples is limited, removing this impediment to estimating demographic parameters vital to the conservation of critically endangered species. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Derelict and active fishing gear poses a threat to marine wildlife. This study details Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin entanglements in recreational fishing gear in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, Western Australia between 2016 and 2022. Eight entanglements were recorded, three resulted in death. While concerning from an animal welfare perspective, the impact of entanglements on the viability of the local dolphin population was low. This is as majority of affected individuals were juvenile males. Should entanglements result in the loss of reproductive females, or impact their reproductive success, the population trajectory could quickly change. As such, management decision making should consider population level impacts as well as the welfare of entangled individuals. Government agencies, together with relevant stakeholders, should work together to maintain preparedness to respond to entanglements and take preventative action that lowers the risk of interactions with recreational fishing gear. © 2023 The Author

ABSTRACT: Research on sex biases in longevity in mammals often assumes that male investment in competition results in a female survival advantage that is constant throughout life. We use 35 years of longitudinal data on 1003 wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) to examine age-specific mortality, demonstrating a time-varying effect of sex on mortality hazard over the five-decade lifespan of a social mammal. Males are at higher risk of mortality than females during the juvenile period, but the gap between male and female mortality hazard closes in the mid-teens, coincident with the onset of female reproduction. Female mortality hazard is non-significantly higher than male mortality hazard in adulthood, resulting in a moderate male bias in the oldest age class. Bottlenose dolphins have an intensely male-competitive mating system, and juvenile male mortality has been linked to social competition. Contrary to predictions from sexual selection theory, however, male-male competition does not result in sustained male-biased mortality. As female dolphins experience high costs of sexual coercion in addition to long and energetically expensive periods of gestation and lactation, this suggests that substantial female investment in reproduction can elevate female mortality risk and impact sex biases in lifespan.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Skull shape analysis provides useful information on wildlife ecology and potential local adaptations. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) often differentiate between coastal and offshore populations worldwide, and skull shape analyses can be particularly useful in this context. Here we quantify skull shape variation between coastal populations from the Gulf of Guayaquil (Ecuador) and the Mediterranean Sea, compared to offshore specimens from multiple oceans. We analysed skull shape differences using 3D models from museum specimens through geometric morphometrics (3DGM). Two complementary landmark approaches included single-point semi-landmarks in homologous features, as well as pseudo-landmarks placed automatically. Results show skull shape distinction between both coastal populations and offshore specimens. Offshore specimens showed little differentiation between distinct locations. Skull shape patterns mostly diverged in the shape and length of rostrum, as well as the shape of the ascending processes of the maxilla, pterygoids, and occipital bones. However, both coastal populations differed in the patterns and direction of change of those features and were also morphologically distinct. Our results are consistent with local data on site fidelity and social structure in the coastal populations. Skull shape changes suggest divergent feeding and sound production patterns are potential drivers, probably specific to the local environment of each community.  © 2023 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Much remains to be explored regarding the diversity of uncultured, host-associated microbes. Here, we describe rectangular bacterial structures (RBSs) in the mouths of bottlenose dolphins. DNA staining revealed multiple paired bands within RBSs, suggesting the presence of cells dividing along the longitudinal axis. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and tomography showed parallel membrane-bound segments that are likely cells, encapsulated by an S-layer-like periodic surface covering. RBSs displayed unusual pilus-like appendages with bundles of threads splayed at the tips. We present multiple lines of evidence, including genomic DNA sequencing of micromanipulated RBSs, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, suggesting that RBSs are bacterial and distinct from the genera Simonsiella and Conchiformibius (family Neisseriaceae), with which they share similar morphology and division patterning. Our findings highlight the diversity of novel microbial forms and lifestyles that await characterization using tools complementary to genomics such as microscopy. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

ABSTRACT: Ingesting marine plastics is increasingly common in cetaceans, but little is known about their potential effects. Here, by utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we profiled the intestinal bacterial communities of a stranded Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) which died because of the ingestion of rubber gloves. In this study, we explored the potential relationships between starvation raised by plastic ingestion with the dolphin gut microbiota. Our results showed significant differences in bacterial diversity and composition among the different anatomical areas along the intestinal tract, which may be related to the intestinal emptying process under starvation. In addition, the intestinal bacterial composition of the Risso’s dolphin showed both similarity and divergence to that of other toothed whales, suggesting potential roles of both host phylogeny and habitat shaping of the cetacean intestinal microbiome. Perhaps, the microbiota is reflecting a potentially disordered intestinal microbial profile caused by the ingestion of macro-plastics which led to starvation. Moreover, two operational taxonomic units (0.17% of the total reads) affiliated with Actinobacillus and Acinetobacter lwoffii were detected along the intestinal tract. These bacterial species may cause infections in immunocompromised dolphins which are malnourished. This preliminary study profiles the intestinal microbiota of a Risso’s dolphin, and provides an additional understanding of the potential relationships between starvation raised by ingesting macro-plastics with cetacean gut microbiota. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: In July 2022, two Risso's dolphins were reported stranded in Hrútafjörður (N65° 09,503; W21° 05,529), a fjord in northern Iceland. These events represent the first confirmed observations and strandings of Risso's dolphins in Icelandic waters. Given the uniqueness of these events, a decision was made to conduct full necropsies on these individuals. This study reports findings from viral and parasitological investigations, morphological and fitness measurements, as well as stomach and intestine content analysis for each of the Risso's dolphin specimens. The results of the necropsies do not suggest any other cause of death than lack of food and exhaustion. A large plastic fragment in one individual's stomach supports these suggestions. The presence of those specimens in the middle of the subarctic ocean illustrates ongoing changes in spatial distribution expanding northward, impacting not only Risso's dolphins but more generally marine life and biodiversity. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Co-occurrence of species with similar ecological requirements could bring individual advantages, but when resources are scarce, co-occurring species would segregate to reduce competition and thus enable coexistence. We studied co-occurrence, group dynamics, and activity budgets, along with the seasonal and diel variation, of two sympatric species: the Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and Dusky Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), in Northern Patagonia, Argentina. Dolphin groups were recorded by nautical surveys between 2006 and 2018, and classified the groups by their constituent species (single- or multispecies groups), group size, age/sex composition, predominant activity, season, and time block. Frequencies were arranged in contingency tables and analyzed by log-linear models. Activity bout duration also was recorded by focal-group follows and compared using nonparametric tests. Single- and multispecies groups’ occurrence varied throughout the year, with a period of high co-occurrence in spring and summer, when both species and most of multispecies groups were present, and a period of low co-occurrence, when mostly common dolphins remained in the area. Common dolphins occur in groups of more than a hundred while dusky dolphins do so in groups of 50 animals at most. Feeding time budget was higher in Dusky Dolphin single- and multispecies groups. Common dolphins showed a seasonal and diurnal pattern in activity budget. During the period of high co-occurrence, dusky dolphins’ group size showed a diurnal pattern, and both species increased their feeding time budgets, a putative indication of more favorable foraging conditions. During this period, dusky dolphins associate occasionally in multispecies groups, increasing feeding time budget and feeding bouts duration, suggesting that the association between the two species is beneficial. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: How do bottlenose dolphins visually perceive the space around them? In particular, what cues do they use as a frame of reference for left–right perception? To address this question, we examined the dolphin's responses to various manipulations of the spatial relationship between the dolphin and the trainer by using gestural signs for actions given by the trainer, which have different meanings in the left and right hands. When the dolphins were tested with their backs to the trainer (Experiment 1) or in an inverted position underwater (Experiments 2 and 3), correct responses from the trainer's perspective were maintained for signs related to movement direction instructions. In contrast, reversed responses were frequently observed for signs that required different sounds for the left and right hands. When the movement direction instructions were presented with symmetrical graphic signs such as " × " and "●", accuracy decreased in the inverted posture (Experiment 3). Furthermore, when the signs for sounds were presented from either the left or right side of the dolphin's body, performance was better when the side of the sign movement coincided with the body side on which it was presented than when it was mismatched (Experiment 4). In the final experiment, when one eye was covered with an eyecup, the results showed that, as in the case of body-side presentation, performance was better when the open eye coincided with the side on which the sign movement was presented. These results indicate that dolphins used the egocentric frame for visuospatial cognition. In addition, they showed better performances when the gestural signs were presented to the right eye, suggesting the possibility of a left-hemispheric advantage in the dolphin's visuospatial cognition. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This article aims to numerically study the hydrodynamic performance of the bionic dolphin equipped with a pair of rigid pectoral fins. We use dynamic-grid technology and user-defined functions to simulate a novel butterfly-mode flapping propulsion of the fins. This pattern of propulsion is composed of three angular degrees of freedom including the pitch angle ϕp, the azimuth angle ϕa and the roll angle ϕr, which can be divided into four stages for analysis within a single cycle. The stroke of one single pectoral fin can be approximated as an ellipse trajectory, where the amplitudes of ϕa and ϕp, respectively, determine the major and minor axes of the ellipse. The fluid dynamics involved in the specific butterfly pattern is mathematically formulated, and numerical simulation is conducted to investigate the propulsion quantitatively. The results show that the dolphin with a higher water striking frequency f can acquire higher propulsion speed and efficiency. Furthermore, the shape of the ellipse trajectory under different conditions could also have different propulsion effects. The periodic generation and disappearance of vortex structures in the butterfly flapping mode show the evolution process of fluid flow around a pair of pectoral fins, which reveals the influence of motion parameters on fluid dynamics under different working conditions. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a hydrodynamics study that examines the comparison and collaboration of two swimming modes relevant to the universality of dolphins. This study utilizes a three-dimensional virtual swimmer model resembling a dolphin, which comprises a body and/or caudal fin (BCF) module, as well as a medium and/or paired fin (MPF) module, each equipped with predetermined kinematics. The manipulation of the dolphin to simulate various swimming modes is achieved through the application of overlapping grids in conjunction with the parallel hole cutting technique. The findings demonstrate that the swimming velocity and thrust attained through the single BCF mode consistently surpass those achieved through the single MPF mode and collaborative mode. Interestingly, the involvement of the MPF mode does not necessarily contribute to performance enhancement. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to note that adjusting the phase difference between the two modes can partially mitigate the limitations associated with the MPF mode. To further investigate the potential advantages of dual-mode collaboration, we conducted experiments by increasing the MPF frequency while keeping the BCF frequency constant, thus introducing the concept of frequency ratio (β). In comparison to the single BCF mode, the collaborative mode with a high β exhibits superior swimming velocity and thrust. Although its efficiency experiences a slight decrease, it tends to stabilize. The corresponding flow structure indirectly verifies the favorable impact of collaboration. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Accurate demographic data play a critical role in implementing conservation strategies and identifying key areas for species preservation. The population abundance and density of Sotalia guianensis were estimated in the estuarine-lagoon complex of Cananéia, Brazil, using distance sampling. The survey covered 1339.91 km with 83 h 05 min in effort. A half-normal model with cosine adjustments was evaluated as the best fit to estimate an abundance of 193 individuals (95% CI 158-237) and a density of 2.55 ind km-2. The majority of sightings occurred in the Baía de Trapandé (48.72%), followed by the Mar de Cananéia (32.72%) and Mar de Cubatão (18.56%), the three areas surrounding the Ilha de Cananéia. The study confirmed the heterogeneous distribution of the estuary and found that the Mar de Cananéia and the Baía de Trapandé were more densely populated, with 2.76 ind km-2 (95% CI 1.93-3.96) and 2.76 ind km-2 (95% CI 2.07-3.66), respectively, while the Mar de Cubatão was less densely populated, with 1.59 ind km-2 (95% CI 1.04-2.44). The findings support previous research indicating a stable population over the last few decades. The Cananéia estuary is an ecologically diverse region located between protected areas under different categories of environmental protection and harbours a significant population of S. guianensis, providing essential resources for feeding and breeding. Protected areas have proven to be effective tools for preserving both marine and terrestrial environments. Despite the close proximity to humans and constant threats, the study underscores the importance of the area for the conservation of the species.  © The Author(s), 2023.

ABSTRACT: (1) Background: When a human or animal is recovering from general anesthesia, their medical team uses several behavioral and physiological parameters to assess their emergence from the unconscious state to complete wakefulness. However, the return of auditory and acoustic behaviors indicative of the complete return of consciousness in humans can be difficult to assess in a completely aquatic non-human mammal. Dolphins produce sound using the nasal system while using both passive auditory and active biological sonar (echolocation) to navigate and interrogate their environment. The sounds generated by dolphins, such as whistles and clicks, however, can be difficult to hear when the animal is submerged. (2) Methods: We implemented a system to audibly and visually (i.e., using spectrograms) monitor the underwater acoustic behavior of dolphins recovering from anesthesia. (3) Results: Eleven of the twelve recorded dolphins began echolocating within 92 min (Mean = 00:43:41 HH:MM:SS) following spontaneous respirations. In all cases, the dolphins echolocated prior to whistling (Mean = 04:57:47). The return of echolocation was significantly correlated to the return of the righting reflex (Mean = 1:13:44), a commonly used behavioral indicator of dolphin emergence. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that acoustic monitoring for the onset of click production may be a useful supplement to the established medical and behavioral biomarkers of restoring consciousness following anesthesia in bottlenose dolphins. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Human-wildlife interactions (HI) are becoming more prevalent with increasing human population. These interactions could have important eco-evolutionary consequences that become apparent only after observing populations for multiple generations. Here, we analyzed 28 years (1993–2020) of data from the world's longest-running study of a wild dolphin population to assess the fitness consequences of HI on common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Sarasota Bay, Florida. We investigated how human-related foraging activities such as depredation, begging, and patrolling mediate reproductive output and reproductive success of conditioned (HI) and unconditioned (non-HI) females. The analysis of 84 females and their 286 calves born during 1993–2020 found a confluence of effects on individual fitness. Reproductive output of females engaging in moderate levels of human-related foraging was 94% greater than that of non-HI females. However, high frequencies of human-related foraging had a negative effect on female reproductive success by increasing the risk of calf death up to nine times when compared to non-HI females, resulting in 31% less calf survival. These findings provide evidence that human-wildlife interactions have considerable potential to catalyze population-level changes by altering individual fitness, and demonstrate the value of comprehensive, long-term data to better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of human-wildlife conflict. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Despite the importance of coastal habitats for the provision of many ecosystem services, these areas are currently among the most impacted by human activities. Impacts on coastal ecosystems may affect many key species, such as the Guiana dolphin, which inhabits Sepetiba Bay in south-eastern Brazil, a highly degraded environment owing to a human-induced rapid environmental change. In this context, this study investigates the potential changes in the local Guiana dolphin behaviour, group structure, bioacoustics, site fidelity and habitat use over the past 20 years. For this, a historical database (1998–2007) was compared with current data on the local dolphin population (2017–2019). Between 2017 and 2019, the Guiana dolphins form significantly smaller groups (W = 3262.5, P > 0.001), spend more time foraging (61 vs. 10% in the past), emit whistles at a considerably lower rate (decreasing by 85.2%), have reduced site fidelity and now use a larger area. As Sepetiba Bay has been severely impacted by human activities in the recent past, with profound consequences for much of its biodiversity, the observed changes in dolphin behaviour are probably a consequence of habitat degradation and, in particular, of reduced prey availability. These findings have important implications for the management and conservation of the Guiana dolphin population of Sepetiba Bay. To break this human-induced rapid environmental change, it will be essential to minimize the spatio-temporal overlap of anthropogenic impacts, to avoid cumulative impacts. To mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the Guiana dolphins of Sepetiba Bay, it will be important to direct the following actions: (i) the regulation and control of anthropogenic noise; (ii) reduction and control of the release of chemical contaminants and organic effluents; (iii) more effective controls on vessel traffic within the areas used preferentially by the Guiana dolphin; and (iv) the implementation of measures to avoid overfishing and bycatch. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Demographic studies are crucial for assessment of the status of dolphin populations and their relationship with anthropogenic activities as a way to make effective management and conservation decisions. In the Gulf of Mexico, the interaction between bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and anthropogenic activities merits special attention. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the annual abundance and area of preference of the coastal population of T. truncatus (period 2005–2020), and to delimit a priority area for its conservation in the Southern Gulf of Mexico marine ecoregion. Abundance was calculated using the Jolly–Seber model and habitat preference was determined per climatic season (dry, rainy and cold northerly fronts) as a function of environmental variables. The association between anthropogenic activities and dolphin distribution was studied and the priority area delimited using potential distribution models. Off the coasts of Tuxpan and Tamiahua, the results show that the dolphin population numbered 306 individuals (95% CI: 162.97; 607.33) and has remained relatively constant over time. The pattern of dolphin distribution varied between seasons, possibly owing to changes in food availability. However, river mouths and lagoons are of importance to T. truncatus throughout the year. On the other hand, fishing and maritime traffic can potentially affect this species. Finally, this study shows that the delimitation of sites of importance for T. truncatus is a strategic tool with which to help conserve the species and associated coastal ecosystems. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In the Mediterranean Sea, interactions between marine species and human activities are prevalent. The coastal distribution of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and the predation pressure they put on fishing stocks lead to regular interactions with fisheries. Multispecies occupancy models are a relevant framework to estimate co-occurrence between two (or more) species while accounting for false negatives and potential interspecific dependance although requiring substantial quantity of data to fit. Here, we extended multispecies occupancy model to integrate multiple datasets to map spatial co-occurrence between trawlers and bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Lion, French Mediterranean Sea combining data from aerial surveys and boat surveys at a large spatial scale. The integrated multispecies occupancy model produced more precise estimate than single-dataset multispecies occupancy models. Our results support that both integrated and multispecies frameworks are relevant to map distribution and understand species interactions in our case study. Besides, our application of multispecies occupancy models to bottlenose dolphins and fishing trawlers enabled to map co-occurrence probability, which open promising avenues in the understanding of interactions between human activities and marine mammals that occur at large spatial scales. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The spread of Covid-19 has reduced human intervention in aquatic ecosystems, which has shown a discernible improvement in air and water quality. Ganges River, being a historical, economic and cultural icon of India providing multiple ecosystem services as industrial, provisioning, regulatory and cultural services, constitutes an important habitat for Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica). The surfacing of dolphins in Ganga river is patchy and unpredictable. The present study unravels 25 different chemical, microbiological, biological and meta-genomics of most abundant bacteria at dolphin surfacing sites in Ganges water during October 2017 February 2018 and January 2021 to elicit the impact of Covid-19 lock down at the Garhmukteshwar (28.7601°N, 78.1437°E) stretch in Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh, India. The most abundant bacteria at dolphin surfacing site was Bacillus subtilis in February 2018 which was replaced by Aeromonas sp. in January 2021. The zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers during pre-Covid period however the dominance pattern recorded a shift towards larger herbivorous crustacean species during Covid-19 lock down. Overall bacterial count decreased whereas Chl a level increased during the lock down. The total zooplankton abundance did not show a significant difference, but relative proportion of larger herbivorous crustacean zooplankton increased in January 2021 samples. The present results convincingly establish effects of shutdown on chemical, metagenomics and biological components of the riparian ecosystem and the information of micro to mesoplanktonic community may be useful for characterizing dolphin surfacing sites, enhancing existing water quality monitoring efforts and also for human epidemiological studies associated with recreational use of Ganga water. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc..

ABSTRACT: Importance: Administration of durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, 20% to 30% of patients do not receive durvalumab because of adverse events (AEs) during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In addition, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have a synergistic effect. Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of durvalumab immunotherapy plus concurrent radiotherapy followed by maintenance with durvalumab therapy for treatment of locally advanced NSCLC without chemotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The multicenter, single-arm DOLPHIN (Phase II Study of Durvalumab [MEDI4736] Plus Concurrent Radiation Therapy in Advanced Localized NSCLC Patients) nonrandomized controlled trial was performed by 12 institutions in Japan from September 13, 2019, to May 31, 2022. Participants in the primary registration phase included 74 patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC. The current analyses were conducted from June 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022. Interventions: Patients received radiotherapy (60 Gy) in combination with concurrent and maintenance durvalumab immunotherapy, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, for up to 1 year. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of the rate of 12-month progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent central review, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated with 90% CIs calculated using the Greenwood formula. The key secondary end points were PFS, objective response rate, treatment completion rate, and AEs. Results: Data from 35 patients (median [range] age, 72 [44-83] years; 31 [88.6%] men) were included in the full analysis set of the evaluable population. The 12-month PFS rate was 72.1% (90% CI, 59.1%-85.1%), and the median PFS was 25.6 months (95% CI, 13.1 months to not estimable) at a median follow-up of 22.8 months (range, 4.3-31.8 months). Scheduled radiation therapy was completed in 97.1% of patients. The confirmed objective response rate was 90.9% (95% CI, 75.7%-98.1%), and the treatment completion rate was 57.6% (95% CI, 39.2%-74.5%). Among 34 patients evaluated in the safety analysis set, AEs of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18 patients (52.9%), and of grade 5 in 2 patients (5.9%). Pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis of any grade occurred in 23 patients (67.6%), and of grades 3 or 4 in 4 patients (11.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Findings from this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial indicate that durvalumab immunotherapy combined with curative radiotherapy for patients with PD-L1-positive, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC is a promising treatment with tolerable AEs and is appropriate as a study treatment for phase 3 clinical trials. © 2023 American Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: An individual reaction to natural threats, such as the presence of predators or aggressors, can shape the social behaviour of an entire population. In southern Brazil, two coastal Delphinid species, Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) and Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) co-occur on a regional scale. However, within Baía Norte, there is a clear spatial segregation between these dolphins at a fine-scale that, combined with records of bottlenose dolphins displaying agonistic behaviours towards Guiana dolphins, raised the hypothesis that such aggressive behaviours may contribute to shape this segregated distribution. Here, to investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a controlled exposure experiment in which surface behavioural responses of Guiana dolphins were evaluated before, during and after acoustic playbacks of bottlenose dolphins. Through aerial footages, collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle, we accessed significant behavioural responses of Guiana dolphins in terms of group organization and behavioural states. During playbacks, we observed a decrease in the cohesion index between individual Guiana dolphins and an increase in group synchrony, indicating that individuals coordinate their movements to aggregate when exposed to playback. In addition, time spent in foraging behaviours decreased significantly during playbacks, suggesting that foraging activities are interrupted, and individuals start to travel. These results demonstrate that Guiana dolphins perform a collective escape behaviour when facing bottlenose dolphins, a potential aggressor, reinforcing the hypothesis that such defensive behaviour is mediating the spatial segregation between these dolphins' populations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Gut microbiomes are important determinants of animal health. In sentinel marine mammals where animal and ocean health are connected, microbiome impacts can scale to ecosystem-level importance. Mass mortality events affect cetacean populations worldwide, yet little is known about the contributory role of their gut bacterial communities to disease susceptibility and progression. Here, we characterized bacterial communities from fecal samples of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, across an unusual mortality event (UME) caused by dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed similar diversity and structure of bacterial communities in individuals stranding before, during, and after the 2013-2015 Mid-Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin UME and these trends held in a subset of dolphins tested by PCR for DMV infection. Fine-scale shifts related to the UME were not common (10 of 968 bacterial taxa) though potential biomarkers for health monitoring were identified within the complex bacterial communities. Accordingly, acute DMV infection was not associated with a distinct gut bacterial community signature in T. truncatus. However, temporal stratification of DMV-positive dolphins did reveal changes in bacterial community composition between early and late outbreak periods, suggesting that gut community disruptions may be amplified by the indirect effects of accumulating health burdens associated with chronic morbidity.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Abstract: There are concerns about the short- and long-term effects on cetaceans from offshore construction using pile-driving. Gravity-base foundations and anchored floating turbines are alternative installation methods that may have less impact on cetaceans. In this study, we investigated the response of dolphins (Tursiops truncatus and Lagenorhynchus albirostris) and harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) to the construction of wind turbines using gravity-base foundations off Blyth, Northumberland, United Kingdom using cetacean echolocation recorders (C-PODs). Data were collected at nine sites across 3 years (2016–2018) before, during and after construction. Generalised additive mixed models were used to investigate temporal, environmental, and anthropogenic drivers of dolphin and porpoise occurrence from 143,215 h (5967 days) of C-POD data. The models explained 27% and 30% of the deviance in dolphin and porpoise occurrence, respectively. Overall, the results showed no long-term effect on the dolphin occurrence from the construction of the gravity-base wind turbine array. In contrast, porpoise occurrence increased by 32% and 75%, respectively, in the years during and after construction, compared to the before-construction year. Other predictors of dolphin and porpoise occurrence included month, hour of day, tidal currents and vessel sonar activity. Our findings indicate that wind turbine installation using gravity-base foundations had no long-term effects on the occurrence of dolphins or porpoise and may represent an offshore construction methodology that is less impactful to dolphins and harbour porpoise than impact pile-driven turbine installation methods. These results are important for future offshore energy developments; however, further studies are recommended to investigate potential species and location variations. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Late Pleistocene fossils from southern Brazil provide a unique opportunity to study the diet and habitat use of the extant franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) prior to human influence. Here, we subject 19 fossil and 21 contemporary specimens to stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (after first ruling out diagenesis via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). The two groups differ in their isotopic composition (PERMANOVA, p <.01), with fossils yielding more disparate δ13C values and recent samples more disparate δ18O values. Their isotopic niches show an overlap of ~20%, with that of the fossils being slightly wider (SEAc = 2.25‰2 versus 1.84‰2). We attribute these differences to impoverished modern fish communities and temporal changes in freshwater influx. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Contaminants are known to contribute to the reproductive health hazards of wildlife, but pollutants–associated detrimental impacts on the endangered Indo–Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis, IPHD) are largely unknown due to a lack of reproductive parameters. Here we validated and applied blubber progesterone and testosterone as reproductive biomarkers to assess reproductive parameters of IPHD (n = 72). The gender–specific progesterone concentrations and progesterone/testosterone (P/T) supported progesterone and testosterone as valid biomarkers in identifying the genders of IPHD. Significant month–to–month variations of two hormones indicated a seasonal reproduction, in accordance with the observation of photo–identification approach, further supporting testosterone and progesterone as ideal reproductive biomarkers. Progesterone and testosterone concentrations showed significant differences between Lingding Bay and West–four region, possibly due to chronically geographic–specific pollutants differences. The significant relationships between sex hormones and multiple contaminants suggested that contaminants contribute to the disruption of testosterone and progesterone homeostasis. The best explanatory models between pollutants and hormones suggested that dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se) were the major risk factors jeopardizing the reproductive health of IPHD. This is the first study on the relationship between pollutant exposure and reproductive hormones in IPHD and represents a substantial advance in understanding the detrimental reproductive impacts of pollutants on endangered cetaceans. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Southern Georgia Estuarine System (SGES) stock of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) resides in estuarine waters near Brunswick, Georgia, USA. There are concerns for this population due to the presence of anthropogenic stressors, particularly in the Turtle-Brunswick River Estuary (TBRE), where polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in dolphins are >10 times higher relative to dolphins elsewhere in the southeastern United States. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association patterns and distribution of the SGES stock based on long-term photo-identification data (2010–2021) using analyses of social dynamics and spatial movements. Social analyses identified 5 distinct clusters, 3 of which were substantially larger and more well-defined than the other 2. Spatial analyses indicated geographic partitioning among the 3 large clusters, with little overlap in their core ranges (50% utilization distributions) but shared ranges in their 95% utilization distributions. Despite having variable ranging patterns, all 3 large clusters used the TBRE in proximity to the Linden Chemicals and Plastics (LCP) Superfund site to a degree, suggesting that they have likely been exposed to high levels of PCBs. Given the spatial distinction and low connectivity between clusters, loss in any of the identified clusters has potential to further segment the population and lead to a decline in the SGES stock as a whole. The fine-scale population structure should be considered in identifying effective conservation efforts at the appropriate scale. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Embryogenesis of cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises) is best known in Stenella attenuata, the pan-tropical spotted dolphin, based on a remarkably complete and well-studied prenatal ontogenetic series. Our study expands understanding of cetacean embryology by adding two additional cetacean taxa: the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas, Odontoceti), and the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus, Mysticeti). We identify key features that characterize these taxa at specific stages and highlight heterochrony between the odontocetes and mysticetes. The toothed whales are more similar in developmental timing to each other than either is to Balaena. The two odontocete taxa, Stenella and Delphinapterus, share similar developmental trajectories while early Balaena specimens differ from the odontocetes. This developmental variation proves challenging to ascribe to the existing Carnegie staging system. Most notably, flippers, hindlimbs, and flukes all provide morphological traits for characterization within the Carnegie staging system. A presomitic Delphinapterus embryo is also described. This study applies the Carnegie staging system to two more cetacean taxa and forms a framework for future research on cetacean developmental genetics and the modeling of fetal growth. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Kinematic analysis of leaping motions can provide meaningful insights into unraveling the efficient and agile propulsive mechanisms in dolphin swimming. However, undisturbed kinematic examination of live dolphins has been very scarce due to the restriction of close-up biological observation with a motion capture system. The main objective of this study is to quantify the leaping motion of a self-propelled bionic robotic dolphin using a combined numerical and experimental method. More specifically, a dynamic model was established for the hydrodynamic analysis of a changeable submerged portion, and experimental data were then employed to identify hydrodynamic parameters and validate the effectiveness. The effects of wave-making resistance were explored, indicating that there is a varying nonlinear relationship between power and speed at different depths. In addition, the wave-making resistance can be reduced significantly when swimming at a certain depth, which leads to a higher speed and less consumed power. Quantitative estimation of leaping motion is carried out, and the results suggest that with increase of the exiting velocity and angle, the maximum height of the center of mass (CM) increases as well; furthermore, a small exiting angle usually requires a much larger exiting velocity to achieve a complete exiting motion. These findings provide implications for optimizing motion performance, which is an integral part of underwater operations in complex aquatic environments. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Yawning is defined as an involuntary behavior with breathing, characterized by a slow opening of the mouth with inhalation, followed by a maximum gaping phase, and ending with a short exhalation and closing of the mouth. Recent reports on yawning in marine mammals (common bottlenose dolphins and a dugong) have challenged this definition because these marine mammals yawn underwater without breathing. However, yawning in marine mammals has only been studied in captive conditions, which indicates the possibility that yawning is an abnormal behavior in captive animals. Here, we report yawning in free-ranging wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins off Mikura Island, Japan. Five yawnings that occurred between 8:00 am and 10:30 am were identified from 1816 hours of video data. The dolphins in this population may exhibit more resting behaviors in the morning, which implies that yawning in this population occurred in resting states that required arousal. This is the first reported observation of yawning in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. The occurrence of yawning in a wild population suggests that it is an innate behavior, rather than abnormal behavior, in dolphins. © 2023 Mammalogical Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin preference and usage of various habitats along the Israeli shallow coastal shelf were investigated between 2019 and 2021 with passive acoustic monitoring devices. A hurdle model was used to examine the dolphins' visiting probability (chance of detection) and visit duration (length of stay once detected) across habitats, with diel cycle and season as explanatory variables. The influence of spatiotemporal prohibitions placed on trawler activity was also examined. It was found that dolphins exhibited higher presence in the vicinity of fish farms, up to three orders of magnitude, and even more so during periods when trawler activity was halted. The study also found a higher presence during the winter season and nighttime. Modeling did not find significant differences in the visiting probability or the visit duration between any non-farm-associated sites, including areas where trawling is prohibited. Further restrictions on the fishing industry may induce recovery of the benthic ecosystem and lower competition for resources, thus promoting higher dolphin presence in natural habitats along the shelf. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: There are few cetacean tissue-specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration studies in the Mediterranean, despite this region is among the most subjected to chemical contamination. PAH analyses were conducted in different tissues of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba, N = 64) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, N = 9) stranded along the French Mediterranean coastline from 2010 to 2016. Comparable levels were measured in S. coeruleoalba and T. trucantus (1020 and 981 ng g−1 lipid weight in blubber, 228 and 238 ng g−1 dry weight in muscle, respectively). The results suggested a slight effect of maternal transfer. The greatest levels were recorded by urban and industrial centers, and decreasing temporal trends were observed in males muscle and kidney, but not in other tissues. As a conclusion, the elevated levels measured could represent a serious threat to dolphins populations in this region, particularly by urban and industrial centers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We provide a new study of previously published eurhinodelphinid materials from the early Miocene of Piedmont (NW Italy) based on a new preparation of the fossil specimens. We studied specimens previously assigned to Tursiops miocaenus and Dalpiazella sp. and provide new anatomical data on the eurhinodelphinid skull and ear bones. In particular, we suggest that a skull that was previously assigned to Tursiops miocaenus must be reassigned to Ziphiodelphis sigmoideus (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Eurhinodelphinidae) based on new comparisons of the squamosal. This finding enabled us to provide new anatomical information on the ear bone anatomy of Z. sigmoideus that was previously unknown. The material originally assigned to Tursiops miocaenus is currently lost. For this reason and due to the fact that the partial illustration of this species by Portis does not allow us to find diagnostic characters for this species, we decided that Tursiops miocaenus is a nomen dubium. Analysis of additional isolated teeth previously assigned to Tursiops miocaenus led to the conclusion that these specimens represent Odontoceti incertae sedis. We performed a new phylogenetic analysis by adding newly discovered character states to a previous dataset and a paleobiogeographic analysis of Eurhinodelphinidae. We found two monophyletic clades within this family. The paleobiogeographic pattern found by the present work suggests the existence of North Atlantic and Mediterranean clades with some species distributed among both basins. We analyzed the virtual endocast of Ziphiodelphis sigmoideus and found that it resembles that of Schizodelphis in several respects, suggesting that some of the more derived characters of the odontocete brain were still absent in these early Miocene eurhinodelphinids. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: During diving, the body is exposed to a number of environmental stressors that result in physiological responses. Many of these responses are common across both humans and dolphins. One of the best known is the dive response, historically referred to as the “master switch of life,” a defense against asphyxia. This is enacted during submersion and consists of a reduction in heart rate and a redistribution of blood to high-priority organs. Increasing hydrostatic pressure during descent compresses all air-filled spaces, resulting in structural changes, and alters blood gas tensions and hemodynamics. In this chapter, we will briefly outline a number of physiological changes associated with diving and compare and contrast these responses between humans and dolphins. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring wildlife populations over scales relevant to management is critical to supporting conservation decision-making in the face of data deficiency, particularly for rare species occurring across large geographic ranges. The Pilbara region of Western Australia is home to two sympatric and morphologically similar species of coastal dolphins—the Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis)—both of which are believed to be declining in numbers and facing increasing pressures from the combined impacts of environmental change and extensive industrial activities. The aim of this study was to develop spatially explicit models of bottlenose and humpback dolphin abundance in Pilbara waters that could inform decisions about coastal development at a regional scale. Aerial line transect surveys were flown from a fixed-wing aircraft in the austral winters of 2015, 2016, and 2017 across a total area of 33,420 km2. Spatio-temporal patterns in dolphin density were quantified using a density surface modeling (DSM) approach, accounting for imperfect detection as well as both perception and availability bias. We estimated the abundance of bottlenose dolphins at 3,713 (95% CI = 2,679–5,146; average density of 0.189 ± 0.046 SD individuals per km2) in 2015, 2,638 (95% CI = 1,670–4,168; 0.159 ± 0.135 individuals per km2) in 2016 and 1,635 (95% CI = 1,031–2,593; 0.101 ± 0.103 individuals per km2) in 2017. Too few humpback dolphins were detected in 2015 to model abundance, but their estimated abundance was 1,546 (95% CI = 942–2,537; 0.097 ± 0.03 individuals per km2) and 2,690 (95% CI = 1,792–4,038; 0.169 ± 0.064 individuals per km2) in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Dolphin densities were greatest in nearshore waters, with hotspots in Exmouth Gulf, the Dampier Archipelago, and Great Sandy Islands. Our results provide a benchmark on which future risk assessments can be based to better understand the overlap between pressures and important dolphin habitats in tropical northwestern Australia.

ABSTRACT: Nonaggressive mixed species groups of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are frequently observed at many locations around the world, but they are not commonly seen in Tierra del Fuego. This work reports the first sighting of a mixed pod of false killer whales and common bottlenose dolphins and its live mass-stranding event in the inner Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) in February 2022. The mixed pod was confirmed to be composed of ~ 50 false killer whales (including calves) and four common bottlenose dolphins, but only false killer whales were involved in the mass-stranding event which occurred at the inner and western sector of Ushuaia Bay next to urban settings. The interaction of natural and human-related factors appears to have caused the mass-stranding in this case; however, the reasons why the pod was inside the channel are still unknown. Although all animals were rescued alive, two animals were found dead days after the event. These sightings and stranding may be considered extralimital records for Tursiops truncatus and add new records in their southernmost (summer) range for Pseudorca crassidens. The handling of the situation during these events also suggest that a better marine mammal-stranding network response program is needed in this southern region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Tooth rake marks are usually used as an indicator of received aggression in odontocetes whose social interactions are difficult to observe directly. Photographic data from five locations of the northern South China Sea were used to analyze seasonal, demographic, and geographic effects on the density of tooth rake marks and dorsal fin notches in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis, IPHDs). The analysis revealed that fresh tooth rake marks were most frequent during the dry season. Males exhibited significantly higher rake mark density than females and rake density declined significantly with age. The density of notches was also significantly higher for males than for females, and lower for young dolphins than for mid-aged and adult ones. Geographically, tooth rake mark and notch density were the highest in Sanniang Bay and Southwestern Hainan. These results provide indirect evidence of variation in social interactions across seasons, across the lifespan of an individual, between sexes, and among different locations. This variation may result from changes in biological parameters, differences in social lives, and habitat characteristics. A model to determine the sex of dolphins was tested, and after further validation, such sex assignment could contribute to understanding IPHDs' social structure. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Nature-based tourism has surged in recent years with the desire for up-close interactions and “connections” with wild animals. The conservation value, animal welfare considerations, visitor satisfaction, and profitability of wildlife tourism are often in direct conflict with trade-offs commonly accepted. In this paper, we reviewed more than four decades of literature on the deleterious behaviors and risks documented during close tourist and other recreational interactions between humans and free-ranging dolphins and encounters between humans and lone, sociable dolphins. Our compilation provides a geographical, chronological, and qualitative overview of these encounters, reviews both humans' and dolphins' deleterious behaviors during interspecific interactions and summarizes the main risks to both humans and dolphins during close encounters. Based on this review, we outline and discuss how both animal welfare and human safety should be managed such that these activities are sustainable; the demand for personal wildlife experiences continues to grow at an alarming rate and the economic pressures placed on wild animal populations run the risk of damaging the very environmental assets that support this industry if they cannot be managed effectively. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Organic contaminants with toxic effects, like the conventional brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and BFRs of emergent concern, and their synergistic effects with other micropollutants, can be an additional threat to delphinids. Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) populations strongly associated with coastal environments already face a potential risk of decline due to high exposure to organochlorine pollutants. Moreover, natural organobromine compounds are important indicators of the environment's health. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), hexabromobenzene (HBB) and the methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-BDEs) were determined in the blubber of rough-toothed dolphins from three ecological populations from the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (Southeastern, Southern and Outer Continental Shelf/Southern populations, SE, S, and OCS/S, respectively). The profile was dominated by the naturally produced MeO-BDEs (mainly 2′-MeO-BDE 68 and 6-MeO-BDE 47), followed by the anthropogenic BFRs PBDEs (mainly BDE 47). Median ΣMeO-BDE concentrations varied between 705.4 and 3346.0 ng g−1 lw among populations and ΣPBDE from 89.4 until 538.0 ng g−1 lw. Concentrations of anthropogenic organobromine compounds (ΣPBDE, BDE 99 and BDE 100) were higher in SE population than in OCS/S, indicating a coast – ocean gradient of contamination. Negative correlations were found between the concentration of the natural compounds and age, suggesting their metabolization and/or biodilution and maternal transference. Conversely, positive correlations were found between the concentrations of BDE 153 and BDE 154 and age, indicating low biotransformation capability of these heavy congeners. The levels of PBDEs found are concerning, particularly for SE population, because they are similar to concentrations known for the onset of endocrine disruption in other marine mammals and may be an additional threat to a population in a hotspot for chemical pollution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: As long-lived apex predators, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) are key indicators of marine coastal environmental health. Skin marks can be observed on dorsal body surfaces that are visible during mark–recapture studies that rely on photo-identification (photo-ID) methods. Skin mark prevalence may be an indicator of environmental or anthropogenic stressors in the ecosystem, which may lead to individual and/or population-level health concerns. The prevalence of marks of anthropogenic origin was assessed in the Critically Endangered S. chinensis taiwanensis population along the coasts of central Taiwan. Fifty, twenty-eight, and thirty-four individuals were identified in 2018, 2019, and 2021, respectively. At least one category of injuries was observed in 47 of 57 distinctive individuals (82%), and adults showed a higher prevalence of deep injuries than the other coloration stages. At least one category of skin lesion was observed in 33 of 57 distinctive individuals (58%), and high prevalence of skin lesions was found in mature individuals. Given the difficulty in taking direct observations, skin mark prevalence is proposed as a proxy for estimating habitat health and anthropogenic stressors upon S. chinensis taiwanensis. The moderate-to-high prevalence of skin marks in this study was designated as a warning of risks. This study provides important updated information for the assessment of the health and survival of this population. More effective management measures are urgently needed to reverse the observed population decline. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Here, we describe the epimeletic behavior of an adult Risso’s dolphin towards a deceased newborn calf of the same species across several days with photographs, acoustic monitoring, and video recordings. Boat-based observation surveys were conducted from April 2014 to October 2021 along the southern coast of Galicia (northwest Spain) as part of a longitudinal study on the ecology of cetacean species. On September 21, 2020, an adult Risso’s dolphin was observed carrying a dead newborn calf in coastal waters. This presumed mother was further sighted with her deceased calf on September 23 and 24 (20 km and 40 km from the first observation site, respectively) and with other adult individuals on September 30, probably after having lost or finally abandoned the carcass. The presumed mother supported the corpse for at least 5 days, which may have had potential consequences for the female health. As direct observations are scarce in the wild, this type of report provides valuable information to better document the occurrence of care-giving behavior in highly mobile marine top predators. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to ISPA, CRL.

ABSTRACT: Physiographic and hydrologic complexities play major role in determining the habitat suitability for river dolphins. However, dams and other water development structures alter hydrologic regimes that degrade habitat conditions. For the three extant species of obligate freshwater dolphins, namely: Amazon dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), Ganges dolphin (Platanista gangetica), and Indus dolphin (Platanista minor), the threat is high as dams and water-based infrastructure dotted throughout their distribution range impact dolphin populations by restricting their movement. But there is also evidence of localized increase in dolphin population in certain segments of habitats affected by such hydrologic alterations. Hence, the impacts of hydrologic alterations on dolphin distribution are not as binary as it seems. We aimed to ascertain the role of hydrologic and physiographic complexities in determining the distribution of the dolphins in their geographic ranges using density plot analysis and also to understand how hydrologic alterations in the rivers affect their distribution using a combination of density plot analysis and review of literature. The influence of some of the study variables such as distance to confluence and sinuosity was similar across species—for instance, all three dolphin species preferred slightly sinuous river segments and habitats near confluences. However, varying influences across species were observed for some other variables such as river order and river discharge. We assessed 147 cases of impacts of hydrological alterations on dolphin distribution by categorizing the reported impacts in nine broad types out of which habitat fragmentation accounted for the majority of the impacts (35%) followed by habitat reduction (24%). These endangered species of freshwater megafauna will experience further intensified pressures as more large-scale hydrologic modifications such as damming and diversion of rivers are underway. In this context, basin-scale water-based infrastructural development planning should take into consideration the salient ecological requirements of these species to ensure their long-term survival. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Ganga River ecosystem is under severe anthropogenic stress. Flow regulations through structural barriers alter the geomorphic and hydraulic geometry of riverine habitats. Determining the ecological health of river habitats under the contemporary modification is detrimental to its restoration and management. This study evaluates reach averaged hydraulic habitat of the endangered Ganga River dolphin (Platanista gangetica) in a stretch between Bijnor and Narora barrages. We consider an optimal minimum flow depth as the determining factor of habitat suitability. Field measurement of the hydraulic geometry and flow characteristics show that the optimal flow depth is available in the study reach during the monsoon period, while in the pre-monsoon, the minimum depth is present only in the reach upstream to Narora barrage. We use a geomorphic instream flow tool (GIFT) and satellite altimeter water level data to simulate reach averaged hydraulic habitat in varying flow conditions in area upstream of Narora barrage. We observe that to maintain the minimum flow depth which supports the dolphin habitat in the study reach, an optimal discharge of about (Formula presented.) is essential. Furthermore, we develop a water-level (altimeter) and discharge (simulated from GIFT) rating curve for the study reach. It can be used to get a first-order estimate of discharge for a given water level or vice versa. This study indicates that the altimetry datasets are good precursors for estimating averaged hydraulic habitat of rivers in the data-scarce regions. The application of altimeter data can be a boon in the effective management of river habitat health over a reach scale. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: All extant toothed whales (Cetacea, Odontoceti) are aquatic mammals with homodont dentitions. Fossil evidence from the late Oligocene suggests a greater diversity of tooth forms among odontocetes, including heterodont species with a variety of tooth shapes and orientations. A new fossil dolphin from the late Oligocene of New Zealand, Nihohae matakoi gen. et sp. nov., consisting of a near complete skull, earbones, dentition and some postcranial material, represents this diverse dentition. Several preserved teeth are horizontally procumbent, including all incisors and canines. These tusk-like teeth suggest adaptive advantages for horizontally procumbent teeth in basal dolphins. Phylogenetic analysis places Nihohae among the poorly constrained basal waipatiid group, many with similarly procumbent teeth. Features of N. matakoi such as its dorsoventrally flattened and long rostrum, long mandibular symphysis, unfused cervical vertebrae, lack of attritional or occlusal wear on the teeth and thin enamel cover suggest the rostrum and horizontally procumbent teeth were used to injure and stun prey though swift lateral head movements, a feeding mode that did not persist in extant odontocetes.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The ecology and evolution of prey populations are influenced by predation and predation risk. Our understanding of predator–prey relationships between sharks and dolphins is incomplete due to the difficulties in observing predatory events directly. Shark-inflicted wounds are often seen on dolphin bodies, which can provide an indirect measure of predation pressure. We used photographs of Australian humpback and snubfin dolphins from north, central, and south Queensland to assess the incidence of shark-inflicted bite injuries and to examine interspecific differences in bite injuries and their relationship with group sizes, habitat features, and geographical locations characteristic of where these individuals occurred. The incidence of shark-inflicted scarring did not differ between species (χ2 = 0.133, df = 1, p =.715), with 33.3% of snubfin and 24.1% of humpback dolphins showing evidence of shark bites when data were pooled across all three study sites. Generalized additive models indicated that dolphins closer to the coast, with greater photographic coverage, and in north Queensland were more likely to have a shark-inflicted bite injury. The similar incidence of shark-inflicted wounds found on snubfin and humpback dolphins suggests both are subject to comparable predation pressure from sharks in the study region. Results highlight the importance that habitat features such as distance to the coast and geographical location could have in predation risk of dolphins from sharks, as well as the importance of considering photographic coverage when assessing the incidence of shark-inflicted bites on dolphins or other marine animals. This study serves as a baseline for future studies on shark-dolphin interactions in Queensland and into how predation may influence dolphin habitat usage, group living, and behavior. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Along the Mediterranean coast of Israel, two near-shore dolphin species are prevalent; Tursiops truncatus (least concern, IUCN) and Delphinus delphis (endangered, IUCN). Ship-board surveys and sporadic sightings over the last two decades have shown that the two differ in distribution—T. truncatus is found along the entire coast and D. delphis only in the south. The environmental and anthropological factors affecting these species’ spatial distribution and determining their habitat preferences in this area are largely unknown. This work is a first attempt at summarizing 20 years of observations and studying habitat preferences for both species, by use of Generalized Additive Models. T. truncatus was found to be present in all areas of the continental shelf where survey effort coverage was sufficient, with a high affinity towards bottom trawlers. Model results showed D. delphis distribution to be associated to (shallow) water depths, though the factors driving their limited latitudinal distribution currently remain unknown. It is evident that T. truncatus and D. delphis are present in segregated areas of the Israeli continental shelf and T. truncatus currently sustains a delicate balance with continuously shifting human activities, while the drivers of D. delphis distribution are more specified, yet still not fully understood. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins live in a fission–fusion society, where strong social bonds and alliances can last for decades. However, the mechanism that allows dolphins to form such strong social bonds is still unclear. Here, we hypothesized the existence of a positive feedback mechanism in which social affiliation promotes dolphins’ cooperation, which in turn promotes their social affiliation. To test it, we stimulated the cooperation of the 11 dolphins studied by providing a cooperative enrichment tool based on a rope-pulling task to access a resource. Then we measured the social affiliation [simple ratio index (SRI)] of each possible pair of dolphins and evaluated whether it increased after cooperation. We also evaluated whether, before cooperation, pairs that cooperated had a higher SRI than those that did not cooperate. Our findings showed that the 11 cooperating pairs had significantly stronger social affiliation before cooperation than the 15 non-cooperating pairs. Furthermore, cooperating pairs significantly increased their social affiliation after cooperation, while non-cooperating pairs did not. As a result, our findings provide support to our hypothesis, and suggest that the previous social affiliation between dolphins facilitates cooperation, which in turn promotes their social affiliation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Although many studies have documented the wide occurrence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in cetaceans, little evidence exists regarding the detrimental effects of PBDE exposure on calf death rates for free-ranging cetaceans. This study analyzed life-history-associated PBDE bioaccumulation patterns in 128 stranding Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) samples over an 18-year timespan from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). In comparison to the records of PBDE levels in cetaceans worldwide, the median levels of PBDEs (median = 10600 ng g-1 lw, range = 721-50900 ng g-1 lw) in all samples were the highest to date. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that adult males (median = 16100 ng g-1 lw, range = 4070-50900 ng g-1 lw) and calves (12000 ng g-1 lw, range = 1250-35300 ng g-1 lw) both had the highest levels of PBDEs compared to the rest of the age/sex groups (p < 0.05). Concentrations of PBDEs in noncalves significantly decreased over the studied period, while those in calves had a slightly increasing trend, which may be due to different exposure routes via fish or milk, respectively. A significant and positive relationship was found between annual calf stranding death rates and body-length-adjusted PBDE concentrations in calves (r = 0.62, p < 0.05), suggesting that maternal exposure of calves to elevated levels of PBDEs may have contributed to the high annual stranding death rates of calves in the last two decades. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are found in waters around Australia, with T. truncatus typically occupying deeper, more oceanic habitat, while T. aduncus occur in shallower, coastal waters. Little is known about the colonization history of T. aduncus along the Western Australian coastline; however, it has been hypothesized that extant populations are the result of an expansion along the coastline originating from a source in the north of Australia. To investigate the history of coastal T. aduncus populations in the area, we generated a genomic SNP dataset using a double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach. The resulting dataset consisted of 103,201 biallelic SNPs for 112 individuals which were sampled from eleven coastal and two offshore sites between Shark Bay and Cygnet Bay, Western Australia. Our population genomic analyses showed a pattern consistent with the proposed source in the north with significant isolation by distance along the coastline, as well as a reduction in genomic diversity measures along the coastline with Shark Bay showing the most pronounced reduction. Our demographic analysis indicated that the expansion of T. aduncus along the coastline began around the last glacial maximum and progressed southwards with the Shark Bay population being founded only 13 kya. Our results are in line with coastal colonization histories inferred for Tursiops globally, highlighting the ability of delphinids to rapidly colonize novel coastal niches as habitat is released during glacial cycle-related global sea level and temperature changes. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Interactions between fishing and dolphins can be detrimental, since on one hand dolphins can be lethally entangled by nets and trawls, and on the other dolphins can predate fish caught by nets. For dolphins, this interaction can be dangerous as they can be wounded or accidentally killed; for fishers, the predation of their catch results in economic losses due to reduced quantity and/or quality of catches and damage to fishing gear. During July and November 2020, we surveyed the “dolphin–fisheries conflict” through compiling 209 fisher interviews from nine locations in Italy and Croatia. Fishers mentioned the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) as the species primarily interacting with fishing, with the major issue being catch damage by predation. The interaction probability varied among gears and seasons, with some fishing activities (e.g., passive nets) more affected than others (e.g., bottom trawls), especially in terms of economic loss (1000–10,000 €/year on average). More than 70% of the fishers claimed that dolphin populations have increased over the last 10 years, in different degrees and based on different areas. Dolphin bycatch rates are generally low; however, 34.6% of respondents reported having captured at least one dolphin during their career. The fishers’ attitude towards acoustic deterrents (“pingers”) as a mitigation measure revealed that few of them were aware of these devices or were using them. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The processes by which animals become genetically isolated in an open environment such as the ocean have not yet been fully elucidated. Morphologically different populations of Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens are observed sympatrically in the Sea of Japan. However, genetic studies that exclusively used limited mitochondrial loci or microsatellite DNA have failed to demonstrate the existence of genetically distinct populations. Here, to reveal the population structure, we analysed genome-wide population genetic data using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) gathered in 2018–2021 from all domestic captive individuals in aquaria, the majority of which originated from the wild, as well as from some stranded individuals, together covering a wide area of coastal water around Japan (n = 123). Multiplexed intersimple sequence repeat genotyping-by-sequencing analysis was performed to obtain the SNP data. Principal coordinate analysis and the clustering method structure indicated that two genetically-distinct populations exist, with little interpopulation gene flow revealed. In addition, the genotypic segregation was reflected in differences in external morphotype. Furthermore, a population demographic analysis based on the whole-genome sequences of an individual from each population indicated that sea-level changes during the Last Glacial Period probably led to allopatric divergence of this species in a limited area of the Sea of Japan, with that group subsequently sharing a distribution area with the other population. These findings yield insights into the formation of genetically isolated sympatric populations in the ocean. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Genetic analyses, initiated in 1984, have played a major role in our understanding of the structure and social relationships of the long-term resident community of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Sarasota Bay, Florida (SBDC). One component of our ongoing study of the community’s social system involves using blood samples from periodic catch-and-release sampling for life history and health assessment studies, as well as skin from biopsy dart sampling studies and strandings, to investigate paternity and mating strategies in this community. These analyses, covering a span of four generations of calves, were originally based on chromosomes and protein electrophoresis, but with the advent of microsatellite DNA technology, the latter has become our analysis of choice. We have performed paternity analyses on 204 known mother-calf pairs. For 151 of the calves (74%), sires were identified within the SBDC, but for the remaining 26% of the calves all sampled males associated with the community were excluded and it is likely that a substantial contribution of paternity to the SBDC comes from outside the community. Of the SBDC males, only 52 males of the more than 200 potential sires were sires. The age of sires at time of conception of a calf ranged from 10 to 43 years, averaging 24 years old. These males have sired 1-7 calves during a documented period of reproductive tenure of as much as 24 years (average = 21.4 years). Four males have sired 6-7 calves each, these males siring calves in the community for more than 20 years. Another 19 males have each sired 3-5 calves and the remaining 30 males were identified as sires of 1-2 calves. Paired males sired 75% of the calves while 25% of the calves were sired by unpaired males. Females with multiple offspring generally had multiple sires for these offspring. These paternity analyses support the hypothesis that a major avenue of gene flow in the SBDC is through the males given their greater ranges, with occasional exchange via visits from males from other areas, as well as the occasional brief movements of females from outside the community range into the community.

ABSTRACT: All the studies that have considered the motivation of the dolphins to interact with their trainers as a possible welfare indicator have been carried out in facilities where the trainer-dolphin interactions (TDIs) sessions were reinforced with food. Therefore, in these specific circumstances, it was difficult to separate the motivation of the dolphins interacting with the trainers from the food drive. The current study aims to assess the interaction between the trainers and the dolphins in the absence of food rewards. The research was carried out at The Dolphin Reef (Eilat, Israel), a facility where the interaction between the trainers and 14 bottlenose dolphins of different sex and age classes did not involve food rewards. A total of 531 TDIs were recorded, with dolphins participating in 94.5% of the sessions and an average of three dolphins per session. The dolphins participated in a higher number and more frequently in the TDIs when toys were provided by the trainers. Diel and seasonal differences were also observed, with the dolphins participating more during the morning sessions and the neutral season. The latency of response of the dolphins to the presence of the trainers on the platform or in the water, whether or not advertised by the trainers’ signal (“call” or “no-call”), was very short (usually less than 1 min), and the dolphins often anticipated the beginning of the sessions by arriving at the trainers’ location before or upon the caretakers’ arrival (96% of the time). Individual differences in the participation in the TDIs were also recorded, which might be linked to both the dolphin’s health/welfare status or their personality. The current study shows that the separation of the TDIs from the food reward allows for a better understanding of the willingness of dolphins under human care to interact with their trainers. In addition, the results presented in this paper show that such TDIs are an important part of these dolphins’ lives, which suggests that these interactions might be an additional tool to improve the animals’ social environment and monitor their welfare. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Humpback dolphins (Sousa spp.), throughout their distribution ranges, are often designated as flagship species for coastal ecosystem conservation. Most of the early research on humpback dolphins was carried out in Chinese waters, and in the last two decades, numerous studies have provided abundant conservation-valuable findings. In this study, a systematic review was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the distributional ecology of humpback dolphins in Chinese waters, to establish an updated national knowledge base about key conservation baselines on this flagship species. Currently, there are at least eight main distribution areas of humpback dolphins along the coast of southern China, representing a clear picture of place-based conservation units. However, the overall biogeographical distribution pattern is discontinuous, and existing marine protected areas are far from sufficient to protect these key areas for the survival of humpback dolphins. Based on the photo-identification technique, cross-matching of humpback dolphin individuals revealed extremely low inter-population connectivity among most of the known populations. Genetic studies suggested that several examined populations have low haplotype diversity levels, with limited inter-population gene flow. Morphological and behavioural evidence also supports population differentiation among geographical locations. These findings provide key baselines for the promotion of conservation management initiatives for humpback dolphins in Chinese waters. All recognizable geographical populations, together with each key habitat, should be considered as independent conservation units. With small distribution areas, low genetic diversity and unfavourable geographical isolation, several populations may be at a high risk of regional extinction. A country-led scheme with cross-regional collaboration is required for science-based, action-focused and timely conservation efforts. Future conservation management initiatives should aim to increase or at least maintain key habitats, inter-population connectivity, population-level genetic diversity and effective population size. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Although the coastal common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus is under legal protection, this species is threatened by bycatch and direct hunting along the Peruvian coast. Species conservation can be better achieved if communities are empowered with knowledge and actions to mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable species. Thus, it is important to understand people's degree of knowledge about a species and its conservation issues. This study evaluated the knowledge and perception of aspects of the biology, ecology and conservation status of the common bottlenose dolphin in coastal communities along the central coast of Peru. Structured questionnaires were completed by 197 people, and seven people participated in open-ended interviews in January 2022. Most respondents were knowledgeable of the distribution and ecology of common bottlenose dolphins. Seventy per cent of those surveyed were aware of some threats to this species. Some respondents were eager to take part in actions that would aid in the conservation of the species. However, 69.5% (n = 137) were unfamiliar with the word ‘bycatch’. Charismatic species can engage the public in conservation actions. This research shows that common bottlenose dolphin can be used as a flagship species for marine conservation. It is important to actively involve all stakeholders, particularly fishers, in conservation efforts and the measures that need to be taken to improve common bottlenose dolphin conservation. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin signals are effective carriers for underwater covert detection and communication. However, the environmental and cost constraints terribly limit the amount of data available in dolphin signal datasets are often limited. Meanwhile, due to the low computational power and resource sensitivity of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), current methods for real-time generation of dolphin signals with favorable results are still subject to several challenges. To this end, a Masked AutoEncoder Generative Adversarial Network (MAE-GAN) model is hereby proposed. First, considering the few-shot condition, the dataset is extended by using data augmentation techniques. Then, to meet the low arithmetic constraint, a denoising autoencoder with a mask is used to obtain latent codes through self-supervised learning. These latent codes are then utilized in Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP) to generate a whistle signal model for the target dataset, fully demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing dolphin signal generation in data-limited scenarios. The whistle signals generated by the MAE-GAN and baseline models are compared with actual dolphin signals, and the findings indicate that the proposed approach achieves a discriminative score of 0.074, which is 28.8% higher than that of the current state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it requires only 30.2% of the computational resources of the baseline model. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to generating high-quality dolphin signals in data-limited situations, which can also be deployed on low-resource devices. The proposed MAE-GAN methods provide a promising solution to address the challenges of limited data and computational power in generating dolphin signals. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Ganges River dolphins (Platanista gangetica spp. gangetica) are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals endemic to the Ganges and Karnaphuli rivers of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, very little basic histomorphological research has been conducted on this endangered species. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the morphological features of different organs of P. gangetica. Despite becoming aquatic animals, they showed similarities with terrestrial mammals, such as the pair of lungs and an apical bronchus in the respiratory system, which are pretty standard in ruminants and pigs. However, unlike the terrestrial animal, the tracheobronchial tree was stiffer due to circularly arranged anastomosing plates of the hyaline cartilaginous ring in the trachea, cartilaginous plates in the bronchiole, and thick alveolar septa. The digestive system showed a three-chambered mechanical and glandular stomach similar to the artiodactyles. However, the intestine showed smaller caecum like the monogastric mammal. The urogenital system showed lobulated kidneys, a urinary bladder, a fibroelastic penis with sigmoid flexure, and a long urethral process similar to some terrestrial ruminants. Considering the aquatic environment, all those modifications, unlike terrestrial mammals, are necessary for their adaptation. Thus, this research will broadly help our clinicians and conservationist to take further steps toward disease diagnosis and monitoring of marine health of this endangered species. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) live in complex societies with high fission-fusion dynamics and exhibit a polygynandrous mating system in which both sexes mate with multiple partners. The benefits of polygynandry vary between the sexes; males likely increase their reproductive success by maximizing the number of mating partners, whereas females may reduce infanticide risk and/or increase the genetic quality of offspring by mating with multiple males. Socio-ecological theory states that mating strategies are dictated by the distribution of females and the ability of males to monopolize them. However, the tactics that males use to achieve reproductive success vary within and across populations. Although some male bottlenose dolphins appear to use a solitary approach to gain mating access, males in several populations demonstrate a relatively rare mating tactic: cooperative mate guarding within alliances. Male alliances generally consist of a pair or trio of males that work together to sequester a fertile female. However, nested or multilevel alliances have been documented in two populations to date (i.e., Shark Bay, Australia, and Jacksonville, Florida). The complexity of male alliances may vary in response to a suite of specific ecological, demographic, and/or morphological variables that promote male-male cooperation and reduce intrasexual competition. In this, we review population-specific examples of male bottlenose dolphin mating tactics and examine several hypotheses that may explain inter-and intrapop-ulation variation in alliance complexity. We also explore the sociosexual behavior and potential countertactics used by females. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2023. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Between 2009 and 2018, five common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at the US Navy Marine Mammal Program presented with superficial cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical findings included ultrasonographic evidence of cervical lymph node enlargement, severe leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and reduced serum iron. Three of the dolphins presented with clinicopathologic changes without presence of clinical signs, and the other two cases additionally presented with partial to complete anorexia, lethargy, and refusal to participate in training sessions. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration or biopsy of the affected lymph nodes yielded Streptococcus phocae by PCR in all cases, and the organism was cultured in one of five cases. Animals were treated with a combination of enteral, parenteral, intralesional antimicrobial, or a combination of those therapies and supportive care. Time to resolution of clinical disease ranged between 62 and 188 days. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of Streptococcus phocae cervical lymphadenitis in cetaceans. Streptococcus phocae lymphadenitis should be a differential for cervical lymphadenopathy in this species, especially when associated with pronounced systemic inflammation and a history of potential exposure. © 2023 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: In the framework of global and EU policies focused on stopping the loss of biodiversity process, deepening the genetic variability, especially of populations species identified as threatened, is crucial for defining conservation units and developing appropriate conservation strategies. This is more urgent for cetacean species in the Mediterranean because they assume a key ecological role in the marine food web and are severely affected by numerous and different anthropogenic pressures. This study aims to increase information on the genetic variability of striped dolphin in the Northern Ionian Sea by investigating the population structure, phylogenetic relationships and phylogeographic patterns using two mtDNA markers. From October 2020 to August 2021, a total of 88 skin tissue samples were collected from free-ranging dolphins in the Gulf of Taranto by applying the non-invasive technique of skin swabbing. An acceptable amount of DNA was extracted from 86 samples and used for subsequent genetic analysis conducted on the partial sequences of 421 and 704 bp in length of the cytb gene and D-loop control region, respectively. In addition, the sequences of the two mtDNA markers were joined together to compose a mtDNA concatenated sequence of 1125 bp for each sampled dolphin in order to investigate the genetic variability of the species population in the study area. Genetic analysis highlighted a low nucleotide diversity and high haplotypic diversity of the striped dolphin of the Gulf of Taranto, suggesting a population in rapid expansion after a period of reduction in size and diversity of the initial population. The phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of at least two different lineages of Stenella coeruleoalba in the Mediterranean Sea, one specific to the Northern Ionian Sea and one shared with the Mediterranean population, confirming results already obtained for the local unit in the Gulf of Taranto. The results point out a potential problem of hybridization between striped and common dolphins which needs to be further investigated. Therefore, increasing the analysis of several markers may increase understanding of the genetic diversity of the population in the Ionian Sea and represent a useful tool to support the implementation of future effective conservation measures.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed δ13C and δ15N values in different tooth portions (Growth Layer Groups, GLGs) of franciscanas, Pontoporia blainvillei, to investigate their effect on whole tooth (WT) isotopic values and the implications for dietary estimates. Tooth portions included the dentin deposited during the prenatal development (PND), the first year of life (GLG1) deposited during the nursing period and the central part of the tooth with no distinction amongst subsequent GLGs (Center). Isotopic mixing models estimating the contribution of PND, GLG1 and Center to WT showed that GLG1 has a strong effect on WT isotope values in juveniles, while Center only starts to affect WT isotopic values from age four. Isotopic mixing models estimating prey contribution to the diet of juveniles using WT vs Center tooth portions significantly differed in dietary outputs, demonstrating that GLG1 influence on WT isotope values affects dietary estimates in young franciscanas. As the small tooth size and narrowness of the last GLGs hinder the analysis of individual layers, we recommend excluding GLG1 in studies based on teeth isotope composition in franciscanas and caution when interpreting isotopic values from the WT of other small cetaceans. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In the eastern Pacific Ocean, three distinct forms of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) have been identified, with suggestions they may be different species: a southern California/Mexico coastal, a northern temperate offshore, and an eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) offshore form. Currently, only one species (T. truncatus) is recognized in the region, with the first two forms described as distinct ecotypes. The goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the taxonomic status of these previously described forms through a re-examination of their morphological differentiation. We analyzed 135 skulls from the eastern and western Pacific, including the two nominal species, T. gillii and T. nuuanu, previously described for the eastern North Pacific and ETP, respectively. Additionally, we examined the holotypes of two currently recognized species in the genus, T. truncatus and T. aduncus. Our results showed significant morphological differentiation among bottlenose dolphins in the Pacific Ocean. The ETP offshore bottlenose dolphins were smaller in skull and body size and diagnostically distinct from dolphins in the western North Pacific and other regions in the eastern Pacific. Our results also indicated that, while other bottlenose dolphins in the Pacific were more similar to the globally distributed T. truncatus, the ETP offshore dolphins shared similarities with a previously described species in that region. The distinct environmental conditions in the ETP may be driving the evolutionary differentiation of these bottlenose dolphins. Given these results, we here recommend the recognition of ETP offshore bottlenose dolphins as a distinct subspecies, Tursiops truncatus nuuanu. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Morphological abnormalities in wild animals can be indicators of the underlying health of a population and may be determined through routine photographic surveys. Here, we assess unusual rostrum conditions in Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) inhabiting South African coastal waters to understand the rate of prevalence of abnormal rostrums and formulate hypotheses on potential causes. Photographic data were collated from systematic boat surveys and opportunistic sightings, obtained between April 1998 and March 2021 in various regions along the South African coast. Overall, 31 unique individuals were found with abnormal rostrum conditions, varying from slight misalignments to severe wounds and/or aberrant morphologies. In most cases, injuries were likely caused by natural events during the animal's life history such as interactions with sharks and/or reef-associated hunting strategies. Mark–recapture data indicated that individuals had survived with these injuries for up to 10 years. This study reports the highest incidence of rostrum abnormalities in the species. As numbers reflect only those that have survived their injuries, they are considered a minimum estimate. A better understanding of the cause(s) of these injuries is important given the endangered status of this species. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The group definition for an animal population is important for building associations among individuals (i.e., social network). Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) have a society with high fission–fusion dynamics that changes their group memberships over time, making it difficult to define groups clearly. In addition, current group definitions of small delphinid species are mainly related to boat-based or land-based surveys, and few definitions exist for underwater surveys. We propose a group definition for underwater observations after comparing 234 group transitions from 44 surveys of simultaneous boat-based and underwater observations targeting the resident Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins around Mikura Island, Japan. Our results highly matched group transitions between boat-based and underwater observations when all video-recorded dolphins during one encounter (from entering to exiting the water) were defined as a group, and groups with at least one shared individual during one survey were treated as the same group. This definition successfully produced highly similar association indices to boat observation. This is useful for underwater surveys of highly maneuverable delphinids, especially for commercial-tour-based studies in which researchers do not have the full decision-making authority for the observations. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Ethological Society.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans exhibit physiological adaptations that allowed the transition to aquatic life, including a robust antioxidant defense system that prevents injury from repeated exposure to ischemia/reperfusion events associated with breath-hold diving. The signaling cascades that characterize ischemic inflammation in humans are well characterized. In contrast, cetaceans' molecular and biochemical mechanisms that confer tolerance to inflammatory events are poorly understood. Heme oxygenase (HO) is a cytoprotective protein with anti-inflammatory properties. HO catalyzes the first step in the oxidative degradation of heme. The inducible HO-1 isoform is regulated by various stimuli, including hypoxia, oxidant stress, and inflammatory cytokines. The objective of this study was to compare the response of HO-1 and cytokines to a proinflammatory challenge in leukocytes isolated from humans and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We measured changes in HO activity, and abundance and expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) in leukocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 and 48 h. HO activity increased (p < 0.05) in dolphin (48 h) but not human cells. TNF-α expression increased in human (24 h, 48 h), but not dolphin cells following LPS stimulation. LPS-induced cytokine expression was lower in dolphin than in human leukocytes, suggesting a blunted cytokine response in bottlenose dolphin leukocytes treated with LPS. Results suggest species-specific regulation of inflammatory cytokines in leukocytes treated with LPS, which may lead to differential responses to a pro-inflammatory challenge between marine and terrestrial mammals. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Fraser’s dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei) possess great healing abilities. Their skin composition can be restored after wounding, including collagen spacing, orientation, and bundle thickness. However, it remains unclear how collagens are involved in the wound-healing process and eventually regain normality in Fraser’s dolphins. Learned from the other two scarless healing animals, changes in type III/I collagen composition are believed to modulate the wound healing process and influence the scarring or scarless fate determination in human fetal skin and spiny mouse skin. In the current study, Herovici’s, trichrome, and immunofluorescence staining were used on normal and wounded skin samples in Fraser’s dolphins. The results suggested that type I collagens were the main type of collagens in the normal skin of Fraser’s dolphins, while type III collagens were barely seen. During the wound healing process, type III collagens showed at early wound healing stages, and type I collagen increased in the mature healed wound. In an early healed wound, collagens were organized in a parallel manner, showing a transient hypertrophic-like scar, and eventually restored to normal collagen configuration and adipocyte distribution in the mature healed wound. The remarkable ability to remove excessive collagens merits further investigation to provide new insights into clinical wound management. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Adriatic Sea is one of the areas most exposed to trawling, worldwide. We used four years (2018–2021) and 19,887 km of survey data to investigate factors influencing daylight dolphin distribution in its north-western sector, where common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus routinely follow fishing trawlers. We validated Automatic Identification System information on the position, type and activity of three types of trawlers based on observations from boats, and incorporated this information in a GAM-GEE modelling framework, together with physiographic, biological and anthropogenic variables. Along with bottom depth, trawlers (particularly otter and midwater trawlers) appeared to be important drivers of dolphin distribution, with dolphins foraging and scavenging behind trawlers during 39.3% of total observation time in trawling days. The spatial dimension of dolphin adaptations to intensive trawling, including distribution shifts between days with and without trawling, sheds light on the magnitude of ecological change driven by the trawl fishery. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding to what extent the living world will be affected by climate change is still to be achieved, especially in the sea. Thus, exploring in marine species the direction and timing of shifts in space use and movements related to climate changes should be considered a priority. In the present study, through a correlative approach, we investigated the influence of temperature and marine heat waves (MHWs) on the spatial traits (local occurrence and home range) of a small common bottlenose dolphin population in the Mediterranean Sea by analyzing 560 sightings from 2013 to 2020. The increase in sea surface temperature (SST) negatively influenced both dolphin occurrence and group size in the study area. Furthermore, regardless of the sex and social unit to which the animals belong, in July–September 2017–2020 individual home range size increased threefold (on average from 5 to 15 km2) compared to 2013–2016, when SST was on average 1.34 °C lower and MHWs shorter of 29 days/year. These results can help forecasting the range of consequences of warming effects and to assist local management efforts, in terms of marine protected areas design and management, suggesting that an integrated multi-level approach that examines the influence of warming on dolphin spatial traits together with the abundance and distribution of prey populations and ecological status of foraging habitats (such as the seagrass beds) could be useful in mitigating the effects of climate change on coastal dolphins. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Mixed-species groups are common amongst diverse taxa including fishes, birds, and mammals. Antipredator, foraging, and social benefits have been proposed as functional explanations for mixed-species group formation. Amongst delphinids, mixed-species groups are widespread, but little is known about their function. To investigate the potential benefits of delphinid mixed-species groups, we compared the number of individuals, the age composition, and the behaviour of single- and mixed-species sightings of Australian humpback (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) observed around the North West Cape, Western Australia. We found no difference in the number of individuals or the age composition of humpback dolphins present in single- and mixed-species sightings, whereas bottlenose dolphins were present in larger numbers in single-species sightings than in mixed-species sightings due to a higher number of adults. Socialising was the initial observed behavioural state of 36.1% of mixed-species sightings, compared to only 5.1% and 10.3% of humpback and bottlenose dolphin single-species sightings, respectively. Furthermore, both species travelled and foraged less frequently when in mixed-species groups. Of 93 mixed-species groups observed during a focal follow of ≥ 10 min, 32 (34.4%) involved aggressive and/or sexual behaviours typically initiated by bottlenose dolphins towards humpback dolphins while the remaining 61 (65.6%) involved only neutral and affiliative behaviours. The results of this study suggest that the observed mixed-species groups provide multiple social benefits, particularly those pertaining to socio-sexual behaviours and the development and care of young. Significance statement: Numerous species of dolphin are known to form mixed-species groups. Few studies have, however, investigated the antipredator, foraging, and/or social benefits that these species may gain by grouping with other species. Investigating these benefits is key to understanding the impacts of mixed-species groups on the species and individuals involved. We evaluated the potential functions of mixed-species groups of two sympatric, inshore dolphin species — the Australian humpback dolphin and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin. We found that both species engage in socialising behaviour more frequently when in mixed-species groups and that they engage in a diverse variety of interspecific behavioural interactions. Our results not only indicate that social benefits are the key drivers of these mixed-species groups, but they also highlight the complexity of social interactions between dolphin species. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Age is an important parameter for the study of ecology and population dynamics. Current methodologies for age estimation in cetaceans generally involve invasive or postmortem techniques. They are not suitable for wild marine mammals with small populations. Our previous study shows that in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, both the number and size of body speckles increase with age. We observed speckles of 41 known-age individuals (28 females and 13 males) between the ages of 7 and 25 years using underwater video data. The ages of individuals were obtained from a long-term identification survey since 1994. Here, we created an age-estimation model using quantification theory type I analysis. The model estimated the age accurately from speckle observation (R2 = 0.77, standard deviation of 2.58 years). We clarified the age of 89 individuals (64% of 139 unknown age individuals) near Mikura Island. This is the first study to use a noninvasive age estimation method to statistically verify its accuracy and revealed the age of the majority of the population. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Between 2019 and 2021, 21 bottlenose dolphins were found stranded dead along the Ligurian Pelagos Sanctuary coast (Italy). For 11 animals, out of a total of 14 recovered, the cause of death was classified as natural, anthropic, or not determined based on gross and histological pathology and ancillary testing. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were examined in their blubber, and results were discussed according to their toxicological properties. All specimens showed the following trend: PCBs > DDTs >> HCB, and the levels of cancerogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic organochlorine compounds (T-OCs) were >50% of total OCs. Immunosuppressant organochlorine compound (IS-OC) levels in 10 out of 11 animals were above 50% of the total OCs. PCB levels always exceeded the threshold of 17 mg/kg lipid weight for PCB-induced adverse health effects. The results suggest that bottlenose dolphins living in the Pelagos Sanctuary undergo a high level of exposure to pathogens and OCs, betraying the designation of the Cetacean Sanctuary and, consequently, of a region created for their conservation. Immune dysfunction and infectious disease susceptibility appear to be highly connected with high levels of OC xenobiotics. These data are useful to understand health and mortality trends in cetacean populations, as well as for developing policies for cetacean conservation and management in this important protected area of the Mediterranean. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: As ecologically fragile areas, coastal zones are affected by both anthropogenic activities and climate change. However, the impacts of these factors on large nearshore mammals, such as Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (IPHDs, Sousa chinensis), are poorly understood. Here, modeling revealed that the suitable habitats of IPHDs are affected mainly by the sea surface temperature (SST), and the habitat suitability decreases as the distance to the nearest coastline increases. In addition, anthropogenic activities involving demersal fishing, contamination and shipping have narrowed IPHD habitats and reduced the habitat suitability. We found that climate change will further narrow suitable habitats located farther than 7 km from coastlines and trigger habitat losses in the eastern Taiwan Strait by 2090–2100 under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The projected decreases in habitat suitability and area emphasize the urgency of establishing connected marine protected areas (MPAs) while considering climate change, intergovernmental cooperation, and public involvement. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustics are widely used to monitor the presence of dolphins in the marine environment. This study aims to introduce a low-cost and homemade approach for assembling a complete underwater microphone (i.e., the hydrophone), employing cheap and easy to obtain components. The hydrophone was assembled with two piezo disks connected in a balanced configuration and encased in a plastic container filled with plastic foam. The hydrophone’s performance was validated by direct comparison with the commercially available AS-1 hydrophone (Aquarian Hydrophones, Anacortes, U.S.) on different underwater acoustic signals: artificial acoustic signals (ramp and multitone signals) and various dolphin vocalizations (whistle, echolocation clicks, and burst pulse signals). The sensitivity of the device’s performance to changes in the emission source position was also tested. The results of the validation procedure on both artificial signals and real dolphin vocalizations showed that the significant cost savings associated with cheap technology had a minimal effect on the recording device’s performance within the frequency range of 0–35 kHz. At this stage of experimentation, the global cost of the hydrophone could be estimated at a few euros, making it extremely price competitive when compared to more expensive commercially available models. In the future, this effective and low-cost technology would allow for continuous monitoring of the presence of free-ranging dolphins, significantly lowering the total cost of autonomous monitoring systems. This would permit broadening the monitored areas and creating a network of recorders, thus improving the acquisition of data. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Describing the acoustic repertoire of cetaceans is necessary to understand the functionality of their sounds and the effect anthropogenic pressures have on animals living in a marine environment. This study provides a description of the acoustic repertoire of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Cres-Lošinj archipelago based on continuous 24-h recordings collected from two monitoring stations, both inside and outside the Natura 2000 Site of Community Importance, during an 8-day period in March/April 2020 and a 13-day period in July/August 2020. A total of 1008 h were visually and aurally analyzed to identify vocalizations and investigate diel and seasonal patterns in their parameters. Furthermore, sound pressure levels were calculated for the low (63 Hz–2 kHz) and high (2 kHz–20 kHz) frequency range. Bottlenose dolphins in the Cres-Lošinj archipelago were found to produce whistles, chirps, low frequency narrow-band sounds, burst pulse sounds, and echolocation clicks showing that dolphins are present at both monitoring stations, during both diel and seasonal periods, in a comparable manner. This paper also provides evidence that whistles, chirps, and low frequency narrow-band sounds change their parameters in relation to the background noise in the area, that varies according to diel and seasonal patterns. This suggests a vocal plasticity in the species and a coping strategy to avoid masking of relevant acoustic signals for the local population in the Cres-Lošinj archipelago. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Anomalous pigmentation conditions occur with low frequency in marine mammals. Here is presented the first known record and resighting of a hypo-pigmented all-white dusky dolphin from Golfo Nuevo off Península Valdés, Argentinian Patagonia. The anomalously pigmented Lagenorhynchus obscurus was observed three times between 2016 and 2018. Images suggest that this could be a case of a leucistic dusky dolphin, apparently a single individual. The hypo-pigmented individual was estimated to have reached adult body size, and was probably sexually mature. More research is required for a proper understanding of the effect on behavioral, ecological and physiological conditions. © The author(s).

ABSTRACT: Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) form an isolated subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea that resides only in the eastern basin. Due to the paucity of records, the conservation threats these dolphins face and their ecology and distribution are poorly understood. While most observations indicate that individuals are found in two isolated clusters in the eastern basin, we hereby present five observations -three visual, one acoustic and one stranding- that possibly extend the range of this subpopulation to the entire offshore waters of the eastern basin. The stomach content remains of the stranded individual revealed a diet based on epipelagic squids and octopods. The stranded dolphin had also consumed seven plastic bags and nine squid-like plastic fishing lures, which had caused a complete gastric blockage and probably led to the stranding. High pollution loads from macroplastics in the Mediterranean Sea may evolve into a new potential threat for this subpopulation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Chilika, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia, is a habitat of the Irrawaddy Dolphin (IRD) and a popular tourist destination for dolphin watching. However, this dolphin-based tourism has turned unsustainable due to the adverse impacts of tourism on IRD. This study uses SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) to analyze various internal and external factors that control IRD-based tourism in Chilika. Content analysis and sentiment analysis are also used to know the tourists' views regarding dolphin tourism in Chilika lagoon, and telephonic interviews with boat owners to determine the impact of tourism on local communities before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. SWOT analysis highlights existing opportunities and strengths of IRD tourism in Chilika, such as prevalent ‘positive’ perception (48%) among the tourists and stable IRD population. 38% of tourists' perceptions were ‘negative,’ corroborating inherent weaknesses and threats of IRD tourism, such as faulty marketing strategy, excessive tourist pressure, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews with boat operators reveal that the pandemic lockdown laid the financial situation of local tourist boat operators down. This study suggests multipronged solution approaches, for example ensuring the integrity of IRD habitat, optimal resource utilization, high service quality, and necessary infrastructure development to facilitate a sustainable ecotourism model in the lagoon. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis), the single extant species of the genus Steno, inhabits tropical and subtropical oceans. It is an attractive species for studying aquatic adaptation and evolution. The latest advances in high-throughput sequencing are transforming the study of marine mammals and contributing to understanding various phenomena at the species and population level by determining high-quality genomes. Here, to comprehensively understand the genetic features and explore the molecular basis of aquatic adaption, the chromosome-level genome assembly and comparative genomics analyses of S. bredanensis were performed. The 2.30 Gb final genome assembly of S. bredanensis (scaffold N50 length of 105.53 Mb) was obtained using single-tube long fragment read (stLFR) and Hi-C technologies. The genome assembly clearly revealed the preservation of large chromosomal fragments between S. bredanensis and the melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra). The S. bredanensis genome contained 19,451 predicted protein-coding genes, of which about 92.33% have functional annotations. The genome assembly and gene sets showed high completeness, with a BUSCO score of 90.6% and 97.3%, respectively. We also identified several positively selected genes specific to S. bredanensis, which may be related to fat cell differentiation, tooth morphogenesis, and immunoregulatory activity. Finally, the demographic dynamics of S. bredanensis were estimated by the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) model and found that the population was affected by the climate at the time. We demonstrated that improved continuity and accuracy of the assembled sequence warranted the adoption of this chromosome-level genome as the reference genome and advanced the understanding of genetic features of the rough-toothed dolphin, which will be essential for future evolutionary studies and the protection of this species. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, we describe aspects of the growing pressure on coastal and inshore common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, hereafter referred to as dolphins) as human use of these marine environments increases. While the ultimate outcomes of many threats from humans have been well-documented, less attention has been given to the physiological mechanisms underlying these impacts. We address these physiological mechanisms by using bottlenose dolphins as the basis of discussion, as much is known about this species, and it is an important apex predator that serves as a sentinel species for coastal ecosystem health. For much of this chapter, we will draw upon information available from the dolphin community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA, that has been studied for more than 50 years. In some cases, the bottlenose dolphin may also be useful as a model for understanding or predicting impacts to less-studied cetacean species. We make comparisons as appropriate with other cetacean species to look at how anthropogenic disturbances, such as entanglement in fishing gear, boat strikes and disturbance, pollution, and climate disruption may affect the health, survival, and reproductive success. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Dusky and spinner dolphins are small-bodied odontocetes that show variation in socioecology across their range. New Zealand dusky dolphins and Hawaiian spinner dolphins of deep nearshore waters feed nocturnally upon prey species associated with the deep scattering layer, leaving the daytime free for rest and social interaction, often close to shore. In this chapter, we investigate relation-ships between foraging ecology, diel activity patterns, and sociosexual activities of dusky and spinner dolphins in breeding and nonbreeding contexts. We review similarities and differences between dusky and spinner dolphins related to mating strategies and tactics, socioecology, and evolution. We examine the effects of breeding season and variation in male testis mass and female receptivity on mating behavior. We further explore the influence of sociosexual behavior on female social grouping and calf rearing. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2023. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Endangered Ganges river dolphin is a flagship species that inhabits the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems. Exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses and anthropogenic perturbations, the species has experienced severe population decline and shrinking of potential habitat in much of its distribution range. A range-wide mapping of its potential habitat and assessment of factors associated with species occurrence therefore bears immense relevance for conservation planning. We used an ensemble of species distribution models (SDM) using occurrence data to investigate dolphin distribution in relation to hydrological, climatic, physiographic, land cover and anthropogenic variables across the species entire range. We followed a systematic prioritization approach to identify highly suitable habitat patches (potential hotspots) for dolphins that require immediate protection. We identified nearly 7945 sq. km of river area as highly suitable for dolphins as habitat refugia for the species, more than 93% of which are outside the protected area regime, thus demanding immediate conservation attention. This study is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and conservation planning wherein the habitat suitability maps will help in developing better management plans and strategies, and the predicted three tier classification of suitable habitats will facilitate decision making and prioritization of river segments for inclusion in the protected area network. We recommend that the inferences drawn from our study must be implemented on priority to ensure species conservation in the riverscape. Besides, our study provides huge scope for fine scale assessment and validation of the predicted suitable areas for model improvement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Rotational behaviour has been observed when dolphins track or detect targets, however, its role in echolocation is unknown. We used computed tomography data of one live and one recently deceased bottlenose dolphin, together with measurements of the acoustic properties of head tissues, to perform acoustic property reconstruction. The anatomical configuration and acoustic properties of the main forehead structures between the live and deceased dolphins were compared. Finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to simulate the generation and propagation of echolocation clicks, to compute their waveforms and spectra in both near- and far-fields, and to derive echolocation beam patterns. Modelling results from both the live and deceased dolphins were in good agreement with click recordings from other, live, echolocating individuals. FEA was also used to estimate the acoustic scene experienced by a dolphin rotating 180° about its longitudinal axis to detect fish in the far-field at elevation angles of −20° to 20°. The results suggest that the rotational behaviour provides a wider insonification area and a wider receiving area. Thus, it may provide compensation for the dolphin’s relatively narrow biosonar beam, asymmetries in sound reception, and constraints on the pointing direction that are limited by head movement. The results also have implications for examining the accuracy of FEA in acoustic simulations using recently deceased specimens. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: How do mammals manage to live underwater? To us their environment presents many challenges: it is often cold, conductive, viscous, murky, saline, high pressured, and most critically—devoid of air. Aquatic mammals therefore need various physiological adaptations to cope with these environmental conditions. This book examines the state of knowledge of dolphin and whale organs and organ system functions. Of these species, the bottlenose dolphin features prominently largely due to its cosmopolitan and nearshore distribution which has enabled long-term field studies around the world. However, much of our knowledge, particularly of their physiology, has required in-depth analyses that could only be achieved from hands-on research. Here, we present a brief overview of how data are acquired—from studies of beach-cast cadavers, studies of animals in managed care, field studies catching and releasing wild animals, to studies applying instrumentation to monitor behavior of animals. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: We investigated elemental concentrations in muscle tissue of three species of dolphins incidentally bycaught off the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, South Africa. Thirty-six major, minor and trace elements were analysed in Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea (n = 36), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus (n = 32) and the Common dolphin Delphinus delphis (n = 8). Significant differences in concentration between the three species were observed for 11 elements (cadmium, iron, manganese, sodium, platinum, antimony, selenium, strontium, uranium, vanadium and zinc). Mercury concentrations (maximum 29 mg/kg dry mass) were generally higher than those reported for coastal dolphin species found elsewhere. Our results reflect a combination of species differences in habitat, feeding ecology, age, and possibly species physiology and exposure to pollution levels. This study confirms the high organic pollutant concentrations documented previously for these species from the same location, and provides a well-founded case for the need to reduce pollutant sources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Causal interactions and correlations between clinically-relevant biomarkers are important to understand, both for informing potential medical interventions as well as predicting the likely health trajectory of any individual as they age. These interactions and correlations can be hard to establish in humans, due to the difficulties of routine sampling and controlling for individual differences (e.g., diet, socio-economic status, medication). Because bottlenose dolphins are long-lived mammals that exhibit several age-related phenomena similar to humans, we analyzed data from a well controlled 25-year longitudinal cohort of 144 dolphins. The data from this study has been reported on earlier, and consists of 44 clinically relevant biomarkers. This time-series data exhibits three starkly different influences: (A) directed interactions between biomarkers, (B) sources of biological variation that can either correlate or decorrelate different biomarkers, and (C) random observation-noise which combines measurement error and very rapid fluctuations in the dolphin’s biomarkers. Importantly, the sources of biological variation (type-B) are large in magnitude, often comparable to the observation errors (type-C) and larger than the effect of the directed interactions (type-A). Attempting to recover the type-A interactions without accounting for the type-B and type-C variation can result in an abundance of false-positives and false-negatives. Using a generalized regression which fits the longitudinal data with a linear model accounting for all three influences, we demonstrate that the dolphins exhibit many significant directed interactions (type-A), as well as strong correlated variation (type-B), between several pairs of biomarkers. Moreover, many of these interactions are associated with advanced age, suggesting that these interactions can be monitored and/or targeted to predict and potentially affect aging.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Odontocetes display a wide range of surface behaviors, including aerial and percussive behaviors. However, only a handful of studies have quantitatively investigated the context and function of surface behavioral events in odontocetes. Here, the display of breaching, side breaching, and tail-slapping by Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) was observed during surveys conducted in three locations of the northern South China Sea. The analysis of 380 encounters revealed that, while breaching was not associated with particular contexts, side breaching was mostly displayed during foraging, probably to gather prey during feeding events, and could therefore be further used to indicate foraging activity. Tail-slapping was displayed significantly more during spring than in other seasons, during socializing and traveling than during other activities, and in larger than in smaller groups. This behavior was mostly displayed by old individuals in a variety of contexts, indicating a potential range of functions including attracting attention, communicating information, expressing an emotional state, or gathering prey together. Unexpectedly, tail slaps were significantly less frequent when the research boat actively followed dolphins, showing that the link between this behavior and human disturbances is not clear. More research is needed to investigate details regarding the display of tail slaps in order to be able to reliably use it as a cue to monitor during surveys that indicates that dolphins are being impacted due to disturbance from boats. Furthermore, differences in the display of surface behavioral events were observed among locations, which may be attributed to differences in foraging and/or communication strategies among different populations. The results obtained here will be useful for behavioral monitoring during field surveys. Significance statement: Even though aerial and percussive behaviors are commonly observed in odontocetes, research conducted on these behaviors is scarce and their function(s) are not well understood yet. These functions may vary depending on the species and even on the population. Understanding the context and function of these behaviors is of significant importance for better monitoring animal behavior in the wild (e.g., categorizing the animals’ behavioral state, noticing signs of disturbance). The present study is the first to investigate aerial and percussive behaviors (i.e., breaching, side breaching, and tail slapping) in wild Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Dolphins exhibited differences in the frequency at which they display these behaviors depending on the population and the behavioral state of the group. These results inform on the potential communication/foraging strategies differences among populations and provide cues to better monitor dolphins’ behavior in the field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The reproductive system is a bodily system that is integral to the existence of a species. Bottlenose dolphins represent a key species from which baseline and benchmark physiological information can be used to assist in the perpetuation of other small cetacean populations. This chapter reviews basic reproductive physiology and endocrinology of bottlenose dolphins, including sexual maturation, reproductive cycles, gestation and lactation, as well as social and environmental impacts on reproduction in both sexes. The work includes studies conducted on animals in the wild as well as those performed under managed care settings, where bottlenose dolphin studies have a long history. In addition, the breadth of the studies includes assisted reproductive and contraceptive technologies, as well as use of ex-situ conservation efforts for small cetaceans, of which several populations are at extreme risks of extirpation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the extent of population genetic connectivity in highly mobile marine species is vital for delineating management units. However, obtaining samples for generating genetic data is challenging for species inhabiting inaccessible pelagic waters. As a result, management strategies do not always align with underlying population biology. Marine strandings provide an accessible and cost-effective sample source for research on elusive cetaceans and can be used collaboratively among stranding networks to generate ecosystem-wide population genetic assessments. Here, we used samples collected from strandings and free-ranging individuals across the North Atlantic to investigate population structure, genetic diversity, and individual relatedness in the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (AWSD; Lagenorhynchus acutus), a widely distributed marine predator. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear DNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed a complete lack of population differentiation across the species’ range, implying an unusual pattern of strong connectivity. No differences in genetic diversity among geographic regions and weak within-group relatedness further support the existence of species-wide panmixia in AWSD. This study emphasises the value of long-term stranding collections for cetacean research and has important implications for AWSD conservation management. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The cardiovascular system in cetaceans follows the general mammalian model but is custom designed for individual species. Notable features include (a) a compliant, elastic ascending aorta and aortic arch, (b) the retia mirabilia, (c) venous plexuses in the head and tracheo-bronchial tree, (d) prominent epidural veins, (e) diaphragmatic caval slings, and (f) thermoregulatory plexuses. During high-speed surface and subsurface swimming of more active porpoises and dolphins, high heart rates, enlarged hearts, and higher affinities of hemoglobin for oxygen (O2) are postulated to maximize lung-to-muscle O2 transport just as during exercise of terrestrial mammals. However, during dives, the cardiovascular dive response (bradycardia and vasoconstriction) is variable and serves to regulate the depletion of O2 stores according to the nature of a given dive. Depth, dive duration, exercise, lung volume reflexes, and cognitive control have all been postulated to influence heart rate during the dive. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Aerial surveys are frequently used to estimate the abundance of marine mammals, but their accuracy is dependent upon obtaining a measure of the availability of animals to visual detection. Existing methods for characterizing availability have limitations and do not necessarily reflect true availability. Here, we present a method of using small, vessel-launched, multi-rotor Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or drones) to collect video of dolphins to characterize availability and investigate error surrounding group size estimates. We collected over 20 h of aerial video of dive-surfacing behaviour across 32 encounters with Australian humpback dolphins Sousa sahulensis off north-western Australia. Mean surfacing and dive periods were 7.85 sec (se = 0.26) and 39.27 sec (se = 1.31) respectively. Dolphin encounters were split into 56 focal follows of consistent group composition to which example approaches to estimating availability were applied. Non-instantaneous availability estimates, assuming a 7 sec observation window, ranged between 0.22 and 0.88, with a mean availability of 0.46 (CV = 0.34). Availability tended to increase with increasing group size. We found a downward bias in group size estimation, with true group size typically one individual more than would have been estimated by a human observer during a standard aerial survey. The variability of availability estimates between focal follows highlights the importance of sampling across a variety of group sizes, compositions and environmental conditions. Through data re-sampling exercises, we explored the influence of sample size on availability estimates and their precision, with results providing an indication of target sample sizes to minimize bias in future research. We show that UAVs can provide an effective and relatively inexpensive method of characterizing dolphin availability with several advantages over existing approaches. The example estimates obtained for humpback dolphins are within the range of values obtained for other shallow-water, small cetaceans, and will directly inform a government-run program of aerial surveys in the region. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Freshwater cetaceans play a significant role as sentinel animals, providing important data on animal species and aquatic ecosystem health. They also may serve as potential reservoirs of emerging pathogens and host virulence genes in their microbiota. In this study, we evaluated virulence factors produced by Gram-negative bacteria recovered from individuals belonging to two populations of free-ranging Amazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis). A total of 132 isolates recovered from the oral cavity, blowhole, genital opening and rectum of 21 river dolphins, 13 from Negro River and 8 from Tapajós River, Brazil, were evaluated for the production of virulence factors, such as biofilms and exoproducts (proteases, hemolysins and siderophores), in planktonic and biofilm forms. In planktonic form, 81.1% (107/132) of the tested bacteria of free-ranging Amazon river dolphins were able to produce virulence factors, with 44/132 (33.4%), 65/132 (49,2%) and 54/132 (40,9%) positive for protease, hemolysin and siderophore production, respectively. Overall, 57/132 (43.2%) of the isolates produced biofilms and, under this form of growth, 66/132 (50%), 88/132 (66.7%) and 80/132 (60.6%) of the isolates were positive for protease, hemolysin and siderophore production. In general, the isolates showed a higher release of exoproducts in biofilm than in planktonic form (P < 0.001). The present findings show that Amazon river dolphins harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria in their microbiota, highlighting the importance of monitoring the micro-organisms from wild animals, as they may emerge as pathogens for humans and other animals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decades, large-scale ecological projects have emerged that require collecting ecological data over broad spatial and temporal coverage. Yet, obtaining relevant information about large-scale population dynamics from a single monitoring programme is challenging, and often several sources of data, possibly heterogeneous, need to be integrated. In this context, integrated models combine multiple data types into a single analysis to quantify the population dynamics of a targeted population. When working at large geographical scales, integrated spatial models have the potential to produce spatialized ecological estimates that would be difficult to obtain if data were analysed separately. In this study, we illustrate how spatial integrated modelling offers a relevant framework for conducting ecological inference at large scales. Focusing on the Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), we combined 21,464 km of photo-identification boat surveys collecting spatial capture–recapture data with 24,624 km of aerial line transect following a distance sampling protocol. We analysed spatial capture–recapture data together with distance sampling data to estimate the abundance and density of bottlenose dolphins. We compared the performances of the distance sampling model and the spatial capture–recapture model fitted independently to our integrated spatial model. The outputs of our spatial integrated models inform bottlenose dolphin ecological status in the French Mediterranean Sea and provide ecological indicators that are required for regional-scale ecological assessments like the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. We argue that integrated spatial models are widely applicable and relevant to conservation research and biodiversity assessment at large spatial scales. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is characterized by a particular ontogenic change in body color from dark gray at birth to pure white (or with a few dark-gray spots) after reaching adulthood. Here, we report a spectrum of anomalous body color patterns observed on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins off southern China. The occurrence of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation was described and compared among six putative dolphin populations. Low rates of anomalies in body color patterns were observed (<1%), except for hypopigmentation, which was prevalent in dolphins residing in the mid-Pearl-River-Delta region (3.3%). © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the impact of human disturbance on wildlife populations is of societal importance,1 with anthropogenic noise known to impact a range of taxa, including mammals,2 birds,3 fish,4 and invertebrates.5 While animals are known to use acoustic and other behavioral mechanisms to compensate for increasing noise at the individual level, our understanding of how noise impacts social animals working together remains limited. Here, we investigated the effect of noise on coordination between two bottlenose dolphins performing a cooperative task. We previously demonstrated that the dolphin dyad can use whistles to coordinate their behavior, working together with extreme precision.6 By equipping each dolphin with a sound-and-movement recording tag (DTAG-37) and exposing them to increasing levels of anthropogenic noise, we show that both dolphins nearly doubled their whistle durations and increased whistle amplitude in response to increasing noise. While these acoustic compensatory mechanisms are the same as those frequently used by wild cetaceans,8,9,10,11,12,13 they were insufficient to overcome the effect of noise on behavioral coordination. Indeed, cooperative task success decreased in the presence of noise, dropping from 85% during ambient noise control trials to 62.5% during the highest noise exposure. This is the first study to demonstrate in any non-human species that noise impairs communication between conspecifics performing a cooperative task. Cooperation facilitates vital functions across many taxa and our findings highlight the need to account for the impact of disturbance on functionally important group tasks in wild animal populations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) is characterized by having teeth covered in finely wrinkled vertical ridges, which is a general manifestation of amelogenesis imperfecta. The rough surfaces are hypothesized to be an evolutionary morphological trait of feeding adaptation to increase the dolphin's grip on prey. Here, we assembled a rough-toothed dolphin genome and performed the comparative genomic analysis to reveal the genetic basis of the special enamel. Results showed that genes related to enamel development or dental diseases have undergone diversified adaptive changes that may shape the special enamel morphology of this dolphin species, including positive selection (CLDN19, PRKCE, SSUH2, and WDR72), rapid evolution (LAMB3), or unique amino acid substitutions (AMTN, ENAM, MMP20, and KLK4). Meanwhile, the historical demography of rough-toothed dolphin indicated several distinct population fluctuations associated with climate change. The genome-wide heterozygosity of this dolphin is in the middle of all published data for cetaceans. Although the population is considerable, there may be population or subspecies differentiation, and with the global warming and the increasing disturbance of human activities, we should pay more attention to protection in the future. Together, our study brings new insights into the genetic mechanisms that may have driven the evolution of the special enamel morphology in rough-toothed dolphins and provides the first results of genetic heterozygosity and population historical dynamics of this species, which have important guiding implications for the conservation of this dolphin species. © 2023 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Gastric ulcers have been reported in a range of cetacean species. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), the most common cetacean species held in captivity, are known to experience gastric ulcers in both wild and captive environments. Documented causes of gastric ulceration include bacterial infection by Helicobacter sp., parasitic infections, high dietary histamine and foreign body ingestion. Gastric ulceration without any obvious cause might be related to stress. Currently, the most accurate way to determine the presence of gastric ulcers in captive dolphins is through direct examination of the stomach mucosa using endoscopy (gastroscopy); a procedure that requires substantial animal training and specialised medical equipment. In this study, we investigate whether cytology of the gastric fluid, collected through the less intensive method of intubation, can be used as an alternative to gastroscopy to predict the presence and severity of gastric ulcers in eight captive bottlenose dolphins at uShaka Sea World, South Africa. An ulcer grading scale was developed to quantify the severity of the dolphins' gastric ulcers observed using gastroscopy. Gastric ulcer severity was then compared with the cytological data collected from gastric fluid samples taken during the gastroscopic examinations. The cytological findings were consistent with other studies, but ulcer severity was not found to be linked to the cytological parameters measured. From these results we suggest that routine cytology of the gastric fluid is not a viable alternative to gastroscopy for diagnosing gastric ulcers in bottlenose dolphins. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Hematological analyses are particularly useful in assessing a dolphin’s health status. However, the creation of appropriate reference intervals for this species is difficult due to the low number of reference individuals. The implementation of individual reference intervals (iRIs) allows researchers to overcome this limitation and, moreover, also consider the within-individual variability. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the biological variations in some hematological measurands, including erythrocytes (RBC), hematocrit (Hct), mean cellular volume and hemoglobin content (MCV and MCHC, respectively), RBC distribution width (RDW), leukocytes (WBC), and platelets (PLT); and (2) to calculate the index of individuality (IoI) and reference change value (RCV), which enable the production of iRIs, in healthy managed bottlenose dolphins. Seven dolphins were included, and the results of six hematological exams were analyzed for each animal. Analytical imprecision (CVa), within-dolphin variation (CVi), and between-dolphins variations (CVg) were calculated, and the IoI and RCV were derived for each measurand. All the hematological measurands had intermediate IoI except WBC, for which Iol was low. The calculated RCV ranged from 10.33% (MCV) to 186.51% (WBC). The results reveal that the majority of hematological measurands have an intermediate level of individuality in dolphins, and thus the application of iRIs is appropriate. The calculated RCV can also be applied to other managed dolphins and could be useful in interpreting serial CBC exams. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Dorsal fins, one of the most notable dolphin's physical features, play important kinematic and hydrodynamic roles and are related to physiological and environmental adaptation processes. Differences in dorsal fin shape have been recently associated with geographic variation, habitat specialization between ecotypes, and ontogenetic factors. We studied dorsal fin variation across several common bottlenose dolphin populations in the Caribbean. A total of 252 dorsal fin photographs from eight coastal regions in the Caribbean were selected for analysis. Dolphin dorsal fin proportions were compared among regions and compared with data previously collected from Holbox, Mexico. Dorsal fin models were constructed for each region. We found that across the Caribbean, coastal bottlenose dolphins exhibit low variation in dorsal fin shape, with the most common dorsal fin pattern having low and triangular shapes, two traits that greatly contrast with the oceanic ecotype. Also, significant differences in overall dorsal fin proportions found among some adjacent groups support the hypothesis that subgroups could be present even within extremely short geographical distances - as has been previously documented. The results of this study can be implemented in population monitoring efforts worldwide, as it uses free software and provides a step-by-step guideline to analyze the data. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: High-resolution dive depth and acceleration recordings from nearshore (Sarasota Bay, dive depth < 30 m), and offshore (Bermuda) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) were used to estimate the diving metabolic rate (DMR) and the locomotor metabolic rate (LMR, L O2/min) during three phases of diving (descent, bottom, and ascent). For shallow dives (depth ≤ 30 m), we found no differences between the two ecotypes in the LMR during diving, nor during the postdive shallow interval between dives. For intermediate (30 m < depth ≤ 100 m) and deep dives (depth > 100 m), the LMR was significantly higher during ascent than during descent and the bottom phase by 59% and 9%, respectively. In addition, the rate of change in depth during descent and ascent (meters/second) increased with maximal dive depth. The dynamic aerobic dive limit (dADL) was calculated from the estimated DMR and the estimated predive O2 stores. For the Bermuda dolphins, the dADL decreased with dive depth, and was 18.7, 15.4, and 11.1 min for shallow, intermediate, and deep dives, respectively. These results provide a useful approach to understand the complex nature of physiological interactions between aerobic metabolism, energy use, and diving capacity. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Understanding how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence group living is particularly valuable from an ecological and management point of view, since social systems influence individual feeding, breeding and health, which in turn affect the population size. Foraging strategies, presence of calves and avoidance of predators are known factors influencing group size in bottlenose dolphins, but little research has been done to investigate the concomitant effect of environmental, social and anthropogenic factors. Thus, here we tested the relationship between the group size of a common bottlenose dolphin population in Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea) and some proxies of prey availability (sea surface temperature, seabed depth and habitat type), social context (presence of calves and sex ratio) and sea ambient noise levels, as noise may impair communication and elicit predator avoidance-like response. Group size, both at intra-population (PGS) and individual levels (IGS), was mainly influenced by water temperature, noise, and the social factors. PGS changed with seasons and both PGS and IGS decreased with increasing sea surface temperature, likely suggesting a relationship between group size and the availability of demersal species assemblages, since the latter are known to be strongly affected by temperature. Further, the increase in noise levels led to a reduction in PGS (in presence of calves) and in IGS (in females with calves only). In degraded acoustic environments, the communication between group members may be further impaired by the density of individuals, thus mother-calf pairs may try to reduce the effect of boat noise by staying in a smaller group, where the masking of one’s signals by those from conspecifics decrease. Significance statement: The study highlighted the relationship between SST (sea surface temperature) and clustering pattern of a Mediterranean common bottlenose dolphin population, which in turn may derive from the influence of water temperature on prey abundance and distribution. Further, the effect of noise and boat presence on the grouping of the most vulnerable portion of the population (mothers with calves) was described for the first time. These results support the need for further investigations with the aim of better understanding the effects of warming and noise on coastal dolphins and provide information potentially useful in a management context. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the depredation process is pivotal to the management of conflicts between wildlife and human activities. Depredation by marine mammals on fisheries occurs when animals ‘steal’ fish from the fishing gear, causing catch loss and damage to gear and catches. The common bottlenose dolphin is a vulnerable species and is the main depredator of coastal static net fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea. The nature and extent of the phenomenon is still poorly understood since evidence is often incomplete or inconsistent mostly due to the different methods used to measure depredation. Here, passive acoustic monitoring devices were used to estimate the consistency between dolphin acoustic detection in proximity to the net and direct dolphin observations and catch measurements at different sites in Sardinia (north-western Mediterranean Sea). Further, some factors influencing depredation (fishing duration and fishing net length) and changes in catch amount and composition were evaluated. The frequency of dolphin detection based on direct dolphin observations was significantly lower than that based on acoustic monitoring; the latter was related to the amount of catch. Thus, the measurement of catch was more realistically related to depredation than direct dolphin observations. Further, dolphin depredation was related to the duration of the fishing operation. The measure of depredation and catch loss provided here can be used to realistically estimate the damage suffered by fishers and provide preliminary insights to guide the development of an approach for sustainable coexistence between dolphins and fisheries. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Tidal energy, regarded as clean and renewable energy source, has received widespread attention from scholars. As the basic structure of tidal power generator, the energy performance and flow characteristics of hydrofoil have a significant impact on the power generation efficiency. In this paper, a new dolphin head-based bionic hydrofoil is proposed based on the special shape of the dolphin's head, then three structures of dolphin bionic hydrofoils are obtained through corresponding modifications. Based on the accuracy verification of the numerical method, the energy performance and flow characteristics of the bionic hydrofoils are investigated. The results reveal that compared with original dolphin hydrofoil (ODH), the lift coefficients of deflected dolphin hydrofoil (DDH) under different attack angles are increased by 35.51%, 22.75%, 19.44%, 20.80%, 25.98% and 32.86%, respectively. The pressure distribution and flow characteristics around bionic hydrofoils are analyzed, and the results indicate that the pressure on the hydrofoil surface affects the lift and drag coefficients. The vortex distribution of the hydrofoil proves that DDH has a more stable flow pattern. The lift and drag coefficients is increased with the rise of inlet velocity, which provides potential value for the selection of tidal energy equipment under different application scenarios. The enhancement of the energy performance and flow characteristics prove that bionic hydrofoil will be effective in promoting energy utilization of tidal power generation and hydro turbine. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cetacean tourism and vessel traffic have grown considerably around the world in recent decades. At Akaroa Harbor, Aotearoa New Zealand, recreational vessel traffic, dolphin tourism, and cruise ship presence increased substantially between 2008 and 2020. We examined the relationship between vessel traffic parameters and the presence of Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) during the austral summer 2019–2020, using automated vessel tracking and autonomous passive acoustic monitoring. Data were collected between December 2019 and May 2020, including the entirety of the first COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Generalized additive models revealed that increasing levels of motor vessel traffic, the presence of cruise ships, and high levels of dolphin tour vessel traffic resulted in decreases in acoustic detections of dolphins. Our findings suggest that Hector's dolphins at Akaroa Harbor were displaced from core habitat in response to each of these vessel traffic parameters. We recommend that managers use immediately actionable tools to reduce the impacts of vessels on these dolphins. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals may suffer alterations in platelet function and hemostasia due to multiple pathologies, environmental conditions (including stress) or exposure to different contaminants that induce platelet activation. Detecting early alterations in platelet function in these animals could be an especially relevant diagnostic tool in these species because they typically do not show signs of weakness or disease until the pathology is in advanced state, in order to avoid attracting predators in natural conditions. The study of early markers of platelet activation is relevant for the detection, monitoring and therapy of inflammation and hemostasis disorders. Flow cytometry provides a convenient method to evaluate platelet activation by following the kinetics of intracellular Ca2+, using sensitive fluorescent indicators that can be loaded into intact cells. In order to study intraplatelet Ca2+ mobilization in marine mammals, we have adapted a kinetic assay of human platelet activation to study platelet activation in whole-blood samples of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4AM and a clone of the platelet-specific antibody CD41-PE that recognizes dolphin platelets. This no-wash, no-lyse protocol provides a simple and sensitive tool to assess in vitro the time course and intensity of signal-transduction responses to platelet agonists under near-physiological conditions. The adaptation of this technique to marine mammals represents a methodological advance for basic and clinical veterinary applications but also for general environmental studies on these species. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The potential risks of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) accumulation in nearshore dolphins are not well understood. Here, transcriptional activities of 12 PFAS on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-α, -β/δ, and -γ) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) were evaluated. All PFAS activated scPPAR-α in a dose-dependent manner. PFHpA exhibited the highest induction equivalency factors (IEFs). The order of IEFs for other PFAS was as follows: PFOA > PFNA > PFHxA > PFPeA > PFHxS > PFBA > PFOS > PFBuS ≈ PFDA ≫ PFUnDA and PFDoDA (not activated). The total induction equivalents (∑IEQs, 5537 ng/g wet weight) indicated that more attention should be paid to investigating contamination levels in dolphins, especially in PFOS (82.8% contribution to the ∑IEQs). The scPPAR-β/δ and -γ were not affected by any PFAS, except for PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA. Furthermore, PFNA and PFDA could induce higher PPAR-β/δ and PPAR-γ-mediated transcriptional activities than PFOA. Compared to human beings, PFAS might be more potent PPAR-α activators in humpback dolphins, suggesting that the dolphins may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of PFAS. Our results may be instructive for understanding the impacts of PFAS on marine mammal health due to the identical PPAR ligand-binding domain. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) is the most used and reliable method to determine the percentage of serum protein subfractions. The interpretation of the kinetics of total proteins and albumin and globulin fractions is receiving increased attention in wild animals, as well as in domestic animals, due to the possibility of identifying typical pathologic patterns. However, the interpretation of these data had to be performed in light of an appropriate method—and species- specific reference intervals (RIs). In marine mammals, as well as other non-domestic species, specific attention should also be given to the different environment (free ranging vs. human managed) and the associated different exposure to environmental stimuli. The aim of this report was to establish RIs for the serum protein fractions evaluated using agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) in bottlenose dolphins under human care. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 40 bottlenose dolphins during standard veterinary procedures to evaluate their health status. Total protein concentration was determined using the biuret method while AGE was performed using an automated system. A pooled dolphin’s serum sample was used to determine the intra-assay and inter-assay imprecision of AGE. The RIs were calculated using an Excel spreadsheet with the Reference Value Advisor set of macroinstructions. The intra and inter-assay imprecisions were 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively, for albumin; 2.9% and 5.7%, respectively, for α-globulins; 3.8% and 4.0%, respectively, for β-globulins; and 3.4% and 4.8%, respectively, for γ-globulins. The total protein, albumin, α-globulin, β-globulin, and γ-globulin concentrations were 65.5 ± 5.4 g/L, 45.5 ± 4.9 g/L, 8.0 ± 1.0 g/L, 5.0 ± 2.0 g/L, and 7.0 ± 2.0 g/L, respectively. We established the RIs for the total protein and serum protein fractions using AGE in bottlenose dolphins under human care. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A juvenile male Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica spp. gangetica) was accidentally trapped in a seine net, rescued as dead and brought for postmortem examination to the Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University Hospital. This endemic species has suffered an expressive population reduction over the last few decades. Therefore, the necropsy aimed to reveal the factors for the dolphin's death. The study revealed a few bruises and scratches in the lateral thoracic region of the skin, including congestion of the lung and liver, both macro- and microscopically. Furthermore, we observed that the dolphin's stomach was empty, the intestines were filled with gas and there was a cyst on its wall. The authors concluded that the dolphin died of suffocation from underwater entrapment in the fishing net. These findings may be helpful for veterinarians and conservationists to make strategies to save this endangered species. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean falls provide a large amount of organic matter to the deep ocean, an otherwise oligotrophic environment. These events are now believed to maintain endemic species and offer intermediate habitats for species in other deep-sea ecosystems. Only about 70 modern whale falls have been reported in the world's oceans to date. We discovered the first known dolphin fall in the South China Sea in March 2020, on the middle slope of the Zhongnan seamount. We set up a camera at the site to observe animals visiting the dolphin carcass for 30 consecutive days from March 29 to April 28, 2020 and made four additional HOV dives to the dolphin carcass. In total, we observed 14 visible megafauna species visiting this dolphin fall, including six fish species, five crustacean species, two echinoderm species, and one species, of which most were scavengers or predators. This was the first record of many of these taxa in the deep South China Sea. Furthermore, two bone-eating worms were found in a piece of the dolphin bone. The worms are identified as new species in the genus Osedax based on DNA analysis. The findings of this work suggest that cetacean falls occur frequently in the South China Sea and help to fill a knowledge gap regarding the biodiversity of cetacean falls in the West Pacific. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in 2010, poor pulmonary health and reproductive failure in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the northern Gulf of Mexico were well-documented. One postulated etiology for the increased fetal distress syndrome and pneumonia found in affected perinatal dolphins was maternal hypoxia caused by lung disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of blood gas analysis and capnography in determining oxygenation status in bottlenose dolphins with and without pulmonary disease. Blood and breath samples were collected from 59 free-ranging dolphins in Barataria Bay, Louisiana (BB), during a capture–release health assessment program, and from 30 managed dolphins from the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program in San Diego, CA. The former was the oil-exposed cohort and the latter served as a control cohort with known health histories. Capnography and select blood gas parameters were compared based on the following factors: cohort, sex, age/length class, reproductive status, and severity of pulmonary disease. Animals with moderate–severe lung disease had higher bicarbonate concentrations (p = 0.005), pH (p < 0.001), TCO2 (p = 0.012), and more positive base excess (p = 0.001) than animals with normal–mild disease. Capnography (ETCO2) was found to have a weak positive correlation with blood PCO2 (p = 0.020), with a mean difference of 5.02 mmHg (p < 0.001). Based on these findings, indirect oxygenation measures, including TCO2, bicarbonate, and pH, show promise in establishing the oxygenation status in dolphins with and without pulmonary disease. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Phthalate esters (PAEs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, arising growing public concern. Nevertheless, information on the exposure and risks of PAEs in wildlife remains limited. Here, we conducted the first investigation of the occurrences, spatiotemporal trends, and potential risks of twelve metabolites of PAEs (mPAEs) in 74 humpback dolphins from the northern South China Sea during 2005–2020. All twelve mPAEs (∑12mPAEs: 9.6–810.7 ng g−1 wet weight) were detected in the dolphin liver, and seven major mPAEs showed increasing trends during the study period, indicating high PAE contamination in the coastal environment of South China. Monoethylhexyl phthalate accounted for over half of the ∑12mPAE concentrations. The accumulation of mPAEs in the dolphins was neither age-dependent nor sex-specific. Compared to parent PAEs, mPAEs generally induced higher agonistic effects on the dolphin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/gamma (PPARA/G) as master regulators of lipid homeostasis. Although short-term in vitro assays revealed no significant activation of dolphin PPARA/G by tissue-relevant doses of mPAEs, long-term in vivo evidence (i.e., correlations between hepatic mPAEs and blubber fatty acids) suggested that chronic exposure to mPAEs might have impacted lipid metabolism in the dolphin. This study highlighted the potential health risks of PAE exposure on marine mammals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Food has consistently been shown to be an important source of exposure to environmental pollutants, drawing attention to the health risks of pollutants in marine mammals with high daily food intake. Here, the dietary exposure risks posed to the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China, by fourteen phthalate metabolites (mPAEs) were evaluated for the first time. On the basis of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the levels of ∑14mPAEs in ten main species of prey fish (n = 120) of dolphins ranged from 103.0 to 444.5 ng/g wet weight (ww), among which Bombay duck contained a significantly higher body burden of ∑14mPAEs than other prey species. Phthalic acid (PA), monooctyl phthalate (MnOP), monononyl phthalate (MNP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono (5-carboxy-2-ethylpentyl) phthalate (MECPP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), and monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP) all had a trophic magnification factor (TMF) greater than unity, indicating the biomagnification potential of these mPAEs in the marine ecosystem of the PRE. A dietary exposure assessment based on the adjusted reference dose values of phthalates (PAEs) showed that bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) may pose a high (HQ > 1) and medium (0.01 < HQ < 1) risk to the dolphin adults and juveniles, respectively. Our results highlight the potential health risks of mPAEs to marine mammals through dietary routes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins have a complex vocal repertoire that varies depending on behavioral context, social structure, group composition, and anthropogenic pressures. This current study describes the whistle characteristics of bottlenose dolphins for the first time in the South Adriatic Sea while assessing the potential differences between whistle characteristics of geographically separated dolphins within neighbouring waters of the North Ionian Sea. The results show that whistle characteristics were similar between Taranto Gulf (Italy) and Boka Bay (Montenegro), despite their spatial differences. The mean peak frequency was 10kHz for each study location while the mean minimum and maximum frequency ranged from 7 to 14kHz. The average duration of whistles was 500 milliseconds. These results share similarities with previous literature, although several studies reported slightly different mean peak frequencies, ranging up to 15kHz in the neighbouring waters of Croatia and Italy. Further, harmonics were produced and formed in 40% of the whistles in Taranto Gulf and 30% of the whistles in Boka Bay. A high incidence of harmonics has previously been associated with behavioral states (i.e., travelling) and with certain types of marine traffic (i.e., fishing vessels). Therefore, it is important to collect simultaneous data on the visual behavior of the focal group as well as document the type and density of marine traffic within the proximity of the dolphins to have an in-depth understanding of vocal behavior. Despite the similarities of whistle characteristics of Taranto and Boka Bay, the whistle contours showed notable variations. Upsweep whistles were the most regularly produced whistle type in each location, which coincides with previous studies in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the least produced whistle had a concave contour in Taranto and was flat in Boka Bay. Previous studies have confirmed that flat whistles account for the least produced whistle contour in the Mediterranean Basin. Examining the whistle characteristics and the variation in whistle contours provides an in-depth understanding of the behavioral complexity as well as its plasticity in the presence of pressure. Therefore, future studies need to include behavior, group composition, noise levels, and human presence to enable an effective understanding of variation in whistle characteristics of bottlenose dolphins.

ABSTRACT: Coastal common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that inhabit urban estuaries are exposed to a myriad of anthropogenic threats. To manage and conserve these populations, it is imperative to understand their habitat use and residency patterns. In this study, we evaluated the site fidelity of common bottlenose dolphins in upper Galveston Bay (UGB), a heavily industrialized area of the Galveston Bay estuary. We aimed to identify groups within the population with varying affinity to UGB and to determine if there are resident dolphins in UGB. The Galveston Bay Dolphin Research Program conducted monthly photo-identification surveys in UGB between January 2016 and December 2019. We identified 442 distinct dolphins within UGB and used their sighting histories to calculate occurrence, permanence, and periodicity. These site fidelity metrics were incorporated into a cluster analysis that revealed three groups. Group 1 (n = 192, 43%) consisted of individuals with the highest site fidelity to UGB and were classified as year-round or seasonal long-term residents. Group 2 (n = 141, 32%) were transients and Group 3 (n = 109, 25%) were short-term users of UGB. This study identified resident dolphins in UGB, and we recommend that this group be monitored closely, as they are particularly vulnerable to stressors in the upper estuary. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Few information is available on fin marks and movements of Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821), along the Italian coast, although significant photo-identification efforts took place in several areas. In this study, photographic data (833 images) of 370 dolphins collected by different organizations from 2003 to 2018 across six different areas in Sicily (Southern Italy) were compared. A software was used to measure angles with notches and Dorsal Fin Ratio of dorsal fins. Only 8 matches were identified between neighbouring areas along the south-western coast of Sicily. Additionally, 2 matches were found between the Aeolian Archipelago and the Strait of Messina. A different distribution of the fin mark pattern among dolphins from distinct areas was identified, suggesting different ecological conditions, levels of social interactions and threats. These results support the hypothesis that Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins tend to aggregate primarily with individuals coming from the same sub-area and only few animals roam widely, connecting with different groups in distant areas. The few matches and the distinct fin mark patterns found in this study suggest that fragmented bottlenose dolphin communities might face high risk for their survival due to low movements and local anthropogenic threats. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Fisheries extension programmes frequently fail to secure mandatory or voluntary adoption of bycatch reduction devices and techniques. Approaches for improving the outcomes of extension programmes are often based on ad hoc assessments and do not consider human behaviour or change theories. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of extension activities that led to various adoption outcomes in two prominent bycatch case studies in the United States: Turtle excluder devices in shrimp trawl fisheries and dolphin bycatch in the tuna purse seine fishery. Using a grounded theory approach to text analysis of interviews and documents, I examine five periods of voluntary or mandatory adoption efforts. I explain the outcomes through the lens of diffusion of innovation theory. The most effective extension programme involved informative and persuasive efforts, enforced regulations, and commercially practical bycatch reduction devices. Voluntary adoption occurred under exceptional circumstances of public and political pressure and a device that offered substantial benefits to the adopter. The two periods of successful adoption applied the most core principles of diffusion theory. This paper concludes with recommendations for how change agents can apply diffusion theory to future fisheries extension programmes to improve the adoption of bycatch reduction devices.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The global expansion of mariculture offers numerous potential benefits but may also pose a threat to wildlife populations. There is currently only one commercial finfish mariculture facility in Hawaiʻi, a nearshore kanpachi (Seriola rivoliana) farm off the west coast of Hawaiʻi Island. This farm lies within the range of several resident odontocete species, and almost daily common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) associations with the farm have been reported since 2007. We analyzed photographs of 35 bottlenose dolphin groups at the farm sighted between 2008 and 2021 in the context of 20 years of survey effort and extensive community science contributions from Hawaiʻi Island. Thirty-six bottlenose dolphins were identified associated with the farm, representing almost one-quarter of the estimated total population size. The discovery rate of new individuals at the farm indicates this is a conservative estimate of the total number of individuals associating with the farm, and social network analysis suggests that associations may continue to spread within the population. We also found a high frequency of farm associated bottlenose dolphins showing aggression towards several other species of dolphins, demonstrating impacts to multiple protected species. © 2023 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Swim-with-dolphin (SWD) activities are popular but can negatively impact target populations. It is important to consider the behavioural responses of dolphins, and quantify the impact on individuals and populations, as well as maximise opportunities for sustainable tourism that benefits socio-economic growth while encouraging pro-environmental behaviour. This is of relevance in `developing countries, where ecological studies are scarce and tourism industries may have developed before science-based management measures were implemented. This study aimed to determine the effects of SWD tourism on the behaviour of resident Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (PPMR), Mozambique. Markov-chain models were used to describe dolphin behaviour transition probabilities in different tourism contexts between 2007 and 2009 (low tourism) and 2017–2019 (high tourism). Results detected significant short-term changes in the behaviours of dolphins. In the early years (2007–2009), dolphins were likely to remain in their preceding behaviour if they were resting, travelling, and foraging. However, for later years (2017–2019) this only occurred if they were travelling. Overall, after tourist swims, and under both tourism contexts, dolphins were more likely to travel and less likely to socialise, rest, or forage. The findings raise concerns that, despite current management measures, SWD activities still affect dolphin behaviour and impose short-term negative effects to their activity budget. Our study recommends time- and area-closures, speed restrictions, and mandatory training programmes to all SWD staff. Given that SWD and whale-watching activities take place along the coast of Mozambique, national regulations are urgently needed to minimise potential long-term negative effects on cetacean populations. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary medicine expresses the present status of biomolecules affected by past evolutionary events. To clarify the whole picture of cetacean pneumonia, which is a major threat to cetaceans, their pulmonary immune system should be studied from the perspective of evolutionary medicine. In this in silico study, we focused on cetacean surfactant protein D (SP-D) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) as two representative molecules of the cetacean pulmonary immune system. Sequencing and analyzing SP-D and LBP in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) lung and liver tissue collected post-mortem elucidated not only basic physicochemical properties but also their evolutionary background. This is the first study to report the sequences and expression of SP-D and LBP in the bottlenose dolphin. Besides, our findings also suggest the direction of an evolutionary arms race in the cetacean pulmonary immune system. These results have important positive implications for cetacean clinical medicine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: For marine cetaceans, Hg biomagnification can negatively affect neurological, hepatic, renal, and immune functions. To evaluate the use of biomarkers for Hg in dolphins, multiple tissues were analyzed from 127 stranded common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the estuarine and oceanic waters of Virginia, USA. Twenty-two percent of liver Hg concentrations exceeded the published observed effect level for liver abnormalities, and 26 % of cerebrum samples exceeded the published threshold for neurochemical changes, suggesting that Hg may have impacted dolphin health. Mercury tissue levels were similar to or lower than those reported from other locations (liver range: 1.4–943 μg/g-dw). Significant correlations were found between tissue types, indicating that skin or liver can be used as a biomarker to estimate the total Hg concentrations in the other tissue types (kidney, liver, cerebrum, cerebellum, pons). This is the first study to measure Hg concentrations in multiple brain regions of T. truncatus. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Populations usually considered foraging generalists may include specialized individuals that feed on a restricted subset of the prey spectrum consumed by the population. By analyzing the time series of δ13C and δ15N values in sequential growth layer groups within tooth dentin, we measured population- and individual-level variation in resource use of three populations of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis)—Caravelas River, Babitonga Bay, and Norte Bay—along a latitudinal gradient in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We show that the Guiana dolphin at Caravelas River is a generalist population consisting of individual dietary specialists, likely due to the absence of other resident dolphin populations thus allowing individuals to target prey across a wide range of habitats. The Babitonga Bay population is also composed of individual specialists potentially due to the selective foraging behavior of some individuals on high-quality prey sources within and near the bay. In contrast, the Norte Bay population comprises individual generalists, which likely reflects its distinctive cohesive social organization, coexistence with two other dolphin species, and an opportunistic foraging strategy in response to resource fluctuations inherent to the southern limit of the species distribution. Although the Guiana dolphin is generally considered to be a dietary generalist at the population level, our findings reveal that the total niche width of populations and the degree of individual diet specialization are highly context dependent, suggesting dietary plasticity that may be related to a latitudinal gradient in resource availability and environmental conditions.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we tested two mother-calf pairs of bottlenose dolphins in a helping task. Specifically, we provided dolphins with an enrichment tool based on the rope-pulling task paradigm to obtain a resource. The calves were unable to solve the task and get the resource on their own, and then we evaluated whether their mothers helped them. Moreover, we also evaluated whether the social bond strength among mother and calf, measured with the simple ratio index, may play an important role in determining altruistic behaviors. Our findings show that mothers performed altruistic behaviors toward their calves only when they had a strong social bond with them. Indeed, only a mother had a strong social bond with her calf, and only she acted altruistically. Moreover, as her calf grew, their social bond weakened and the mother stopped performing altruistic behaviors. As a result, our data seem to suggest the strength of social bonds has an important role in determining altruism. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to ISPA, CRL.

ABSTRACT: Sociosexual behavior is not directly related to reproduction. It is observed between mature and immature individuals of both sexes and interactions can be between mixed- or same-sex individuals. This behavior may have important social functions. We observed and recorded the sociosexual behavior of wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), underwater off Mikura Island, Japan, with regards to erection and mounting. This behavior was observed mainly between mothers and sons and in groups of subadult males (age 1-13 years). In subadult males, mounting behavior toward one passive individual from two or more individuals playing an active role, occurred in most cases. This behavior involving three or more participants has rarely been observed in other animal species, except for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), common bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus), and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas). Sociosexual behavior in the Mikura Island dolphins may not be agonistic because individuals in the passive role did not try to escape from the individuals playing the active role. Further studies on sociosexual behavior T. aduncus could reveal the social functions of this behavior, such as younger animals practicing mating behaviors required as adults and developing their relationships for when they are adults. © 2023 Mammalogical Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we focus on the design and analysis of a bionic gliding robotic dolphin. Inspired by natural dolphins, a novel bionic gliding robotic dolphin is developed. Different from the existing ones, the gliding robotic dolphin developed in this work is specially introduced with a yaw joint to connect its three oscillating joints to improve maneuverability in both dolphin-like swimming and gliding motion. Consequently, the gliding robotic dolphin can realize several flexible motion patterns under the coordination of its flippers, yaw joint, oscillating joints, and buoyancy-driven modular. Thereafter, relying on the Newton–Euler method, a hybrid-driven dynamic model is constructed to further analyze the propulsive performance in both dolphin-like swimming and gliding motions. Finally, various simulations and experiments, including forward swimming, gliding, and turning in both dolphin-like swimming and gliding modes, are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the developed gliding robotic dolphin. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Measurements from 106 stranded short‐beaked common dolphins along the Irish coast were taken between March 2017 and March 2023. Data were collected from the Irish Necropsy Project and Irish Cetacean Stranding Scheme. Total length measurements were gathered from 103 individuals where the tail flukes were still attached. These ranged between 96–238cm, mean 185.7cm, SD 31.43cm. Males (n = 58) ranged from 96–238cm, averaging 189cm, SD 34.64cm. Females (n = 40) measured 117.5–231cm, averaging 181cm, SD 25.80cm. Scaled dorsal fin photos were taken from stranded dolphins to formulate an equation to estimate the total length of live dolphins. The total lengths of 29 live common dolphins were estimated off the southwest coast of Ireland using laser photogrammetry and dorsal fin dimensions between March 2018–April 2019. Total lengths for three stranded dolphins with amputated tail flukes were also estimated. Dorsal fin base lengths were the most accurate predictor of total length R2 = 0.78. Total length estimates ranged between 143.77–242.25cm, averaging 194.78cm, SD 20.05cm. The adoption of laser photogrammetry as a measurement tool warrants further exploration as a means to reduce potential disruption from aerial systems and enhance the utility of behavioural and photo‐ID images. This study describes a non‐invasive technique with a range of possible applications for understanding pod size structure and seasonality due to this species’ approachable behaviour and inquisitive nature. © 2023 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Cold agglutinin disease, one of the serological classifications of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, is caused by the production of autoantibodies that react with erythrocytes at low temperatures. A captive bottlenose dolphin presented with regenerative and hemolytic anemia. Anticoagulated whole blood was agglutinated at room temperature (approximately 18°C), with reversal of agglutination on warming to 37°C, indicating the presence of cold agglutinin. Based on these findings, this animal was diagnosed with cold agglutinin disease. Clindamycin, doxycycline, and prednisolone were administered orally to treat the infection and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. Anemia gradually improved after initiation of pharmacotherapy, and erythrogenesis slowed as erythroblasts disappeared and reticulocyte count decreased in peripheral blood. This represents the first report of cold agglutinin disease in a cetacean. © 2023, Japanese Society of Veterinary Science. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A long-held belief in classical Mediterranean seafaring is that merchant ships were outfitted with heavy weights called dolphins mounted at the ends of yardarms and were defensive weapons dropped on opposing ships to sink them. A review of the iconographic and textual evidence, however, reveals no evidence to support such a weapon was ever used on merchant ships sailing in the open seas, and instead, the textual evidence allows for the possibility that cranes or even catapults were outfitted on ships as offensive weapons as early as 424 BC and on merchant ships, but only under special conditions, in 413 BC. © 2023 Nautical Archaeology Society.

ABSTRACT: Age parameters in cetaceans allow examining conservation and studying individuals with growth affection. The age and sexual maturity of 51 stranded Stenella coeruleoalba striped dolphins from the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) of Costa Rica, most suffering brucellosis (95.6%), were assessed. In order to ascertain the dolphins’ ages, we measured the length and growth of dentin-layer group counts (GLGs) and assessed flipper bone radiography without (FBSA) and with a formula (FBF). Sexual maturity was determined through gonadal histology and sexual hormone serum levels. Compared with a model based on S. coeruleoalba ages estimations in other latitudes, the striped dolphin studied displayed deficient growth parameters, with considerable variability in length, teeth, and flippers bone development. Close to 43% (n = 15) of GLGs’ measurements were below the body length average ranges for the predicted age, suggesting developmental abnormalities. Likewise, 34.4% and 31.2% of the dolphins assessed by FBSA and FBF were also below the body length based on age prediction curves, also indicating developmental abnormalities. This information is supported by the poor correlation between GLGs, FBSA, and FBF. Inconsistencies between sexually mature males and females related to GLGs, FBSA, and FBF were evident. Although the different oceanic settings of the ETP, such as contamination, food access, diseases, and other parameters, may influence size variation, our data also suggest that long-lasting debilitating brucellosis may account for detrimental growth in the ETP striped dolphins. Our study highlights the possible deleterious consequences of chronic infectious diseases in the cetacean populations already confronting distressful conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Eurhinodelphinids are a family of extremely long-snouted dolphins that once was widespread across the North Atlantic realm, but so far has not been recorded from the epicontinental Paratethys Sea. Here, we describe a new specimen of Xiphiacetus cristatus, including the cranium, left ear bones and a partial mandible, from the Middle Miocene (Badenian) of Austria. Our new fossil is the first record of this species outside the North Atlantic proper, and the first unequivocal record of eurhinodelphinids from the Paratethys. Its presence suggests a local invasion via the Mediterranean, and corroborates the persistence of an active marine gateway between the Mediterranean and the Central Paratethys throughout the Middle Miocene. Measurements of the bony labyrinth reveal that X. cristatus likely employed narrow-band high-frequency echolocation, making eurhinodelphinids only the second extinct odontocete family with this trait. Marked non-orthogonality of the semicircular canals suggests that X. cristatus was unsuited to rapid head movements, and thus more likely a benthic forager than a snap feeder. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Innovation has been documented among several animal taxa (e.g., birds; Lefebvre, 2000), primates (Reader & Laland, 2002), and marine mammals (Patterson & Mann, 2015) and is defined as “a new or modified learned behavior not previously found in the population” (Reader & Laland, 2003, p. 14), characterized by behavioral flexibility and advanced cognitive processing (Lefebvre, 2000). Marine mammals exhibit innovative behaviors both in managed care (e.g., Herman, 2002) and in the wild, the latter noted in response to human activities (see Chilvers & Corkeron, 2001; Mann & Kemps, 2003) and foraging techniques (Mann & Sargeant, 2003; Sargeant et al., 2005). Reader & Laland (2003) described learning as an essential component of innovation, which occurs following a successful or rewarding innovation, enhancing the likelihood that the behavior(s) will be repeated, refined, and potentially transferred to conspecif-ics. However, the distinction between innovation and learning remains unclear (Reader & Laland, 2003), and innovation at the individual level may be a form of asocial learning (Rendell et al., 2007). Fundamental processes inherent to innova-tion include exploration, motivation (Kummer & Goodall, 1985), examination of extrinsic factors (e.g., environment, conspecifics; Hauser, 1988; Lee, 1991; Reader & Laland, 2001; Patterson & Mann, 2015), creativity (Ramsey et al., 2007; Bateson & Martin, 2013), play (Bateson & Martin, 2013), and the expression of behavioral flexibility across various contexts (Reader & Laland, 2003). © 2023,International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

ABSTRACT: Small, island-associated populations of cetaceans have evolved around numerous oceanic islands, likely due to habitat discontinuities between nearshore and offshore waters. However, little is known about the ecology and structure of cetacean populations around the Mariana Islands, a remote archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. We present sighting, photo-identification, and genetic data collected during twelve years of surveys around these islands that reveal the existence of a small, island-associated population of bottlenose dolphins. Nearly half of the photo-identified individuals were encountered in more than one year. Both haplotypic and nuclear genetic diversity among sampled individuals was low (haplotypic diversity = 0.701, nuclear heterozygosity = 0.658), suggesting low abundance. We used mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data to estimate yearly abundance in the southern portion of the population’s range from 2011 to 2018. Each abundance estimate was less than 54 individuals, with each upper 95% confidence interval below 100. Additional survey effort is necessary to generate a full population abundance estimate. We found extensive introgression of Fraser’s dolphin DNA into both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of the population, suggesting at least two hybridization events more than two generations in the past. The Mariana Islands are used extensively by the U.S. military for land and sea training operations. Thus, this unique bottlenose dolphin population likely faces high exposure to multiple threats.

ABSTRACT: Background. Sustainable management requires spatial mapping of both species distribution and human activities to identify potential risk of conflict. The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a priority species of the European Union Habitat Directive, thus, to promote its conservation, the understanding of habitat use and distribution, as well as the identification and spatial trend of the human activities which may directly affect populations traits, is pivotal. Methods. A MaxEnt modeling approach was applied to predict the seasonal (from April to September) habitat use of a small population of bottlenose dolphins in the north-western Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea) in relation to environmental variables and the likelihoods of boat and fishing net presence. Then, the overlapping areas between dolphin, fishing net and boat presence were identified to provide insights for the marine spatial management of this area. Results. Three of the main factors influencing the seasonal distribution of bottlenose dolphins in the area are directly (boating and fishing) or indirectly (ocean warming) related to human activities. Furthermore, almost half of the most suitable area for dolphins overlapped with areas used by fishing and boating. Finally, relying on fishing distribution models, we also shed light on the potential impact of fishing on the Posidonia oceanica beds, a protected habitat, which received higher fishing efforts than other habitat types. Discussion. Modelling the spatial patterns of anthropogenic activities was fundamental to understand the ecological impacts both on cetacean habitat use and protected habitats. A greater research effort is suggested to detect potential changes in dolphin habitat suitability, also in relation to ocean warming, to assess dolphin bycatch and the status of target fish species, and to evaluate sensitive habitats conditions, such as the Posidonia oceanica meadow.

ABSTRACT: A healthy ecosystem is a subject matter of interest because of its rich biodiversity. But natural climatic changes, as well as various man-made anthropogenic factors, not only emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere resulting in global warming but influence various ecosystems of the earth. The aquatic ecosystem is one such example where the dolphin, with its complex behaviour, is recognized as one of the most intelligent members. The natural hydrodynamic body system speeds up underwater and the SONAR system communication technology helps dolphins to work as an efficient aquatic health indicator. But human activities, including aquatic poaching and fishing, creating underwater noise pollution and undesirable infrastructures and producing debris from their generated wastes obstruct the proper functioning of these systems and ultimately contribute to their habitat loss. So, dolphins’ ( Gangetic ones in India) disappearance from their comfortable living zone was inevitable and observed in the past few decades as they migrated to areas with more favourable conditions. The available information related to the rejuvenation in the qualities of the Gangetic water and the restoration of the dolphin’s habitat during COVID pandemic confirmed the absence of the negative impact of human activities on the Gangetic ecosystem. Hence, identification of the important steps to be implemented by the concerned authorities in post-COVID situation and their maintenance by the common people is necessary to balance such important aquatic biodiversity in the long run, keeping the country’s developmental activities operational. This review article is an endeavour towards that direction. ©: Author (s). Publishing rights @ ANSF.

ABSTRACT: Biphonation, deterministic chaos, sidebands and subharmonics are four non-linear phenomena (NLP) that have been identified as common additions in the phonations of animals. NLP have been hypothesised to communicate urgency, caller identification, fitness and arousal/valence states for a variety of species but have yet to be studied in detail for bottlenose dolphins. For this study, the signature whistles of nine bottlenose dolphins residing at the US Navy Marine Mammal Program (MMP) were opportunistically recorded during routine periods of separation from conspecifics. NLP were found to be common additions onto the spectral structure of signature whistles, occurring in 53% of recorded whistles (340/642). Sidebands were the most common NLP type produced. Although less frequently emitted, biphonations were characterised by a significantly longer persistence than the other NLP types. Age had a negative correlation with overall NLP presence, and more specifically, sideband presence. Individual differences in NLP use existed between dolphins; however, all dolphins were recorded producing a minimum of two NLP types. We describe NLP prevalence in dolphin whistles in order to provide a useful baseline for continued research to further identify changes in NLP across behavioural and/or health conditions. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of an animal's chronological age is crucial for understanding and predicting population demographics, survival and reproduction, but accurate age determination for many wild animals remains challenging. Previous methods to estimate age require invasive procedures, such as tooth extraction to analyse growth layers, which are difficult to carry out with large, mobile animals such as cetaceans. However, recent advances in epigenetic methods have opened new avenues for precise age determination. These ‘epigenetic clocks’ present a less invasive alternative and can provide age estimates with unprecedented accuracy. Here, we present a species-specific epigenetic clock based on skin tissue samples for a population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia. We measured methylation levels at 37,492 cytosine-guanine sites (CpG sites) in 165 samples using the mammalian methylation array. Chronological age estimates with an accuracy of ±1 year were available for 68 animals as part of a long-term behavioral study of this population. Using these samples with known age, we built an elastic net model with Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation, which retained 43 CpG sites, providing an r = 0.86 and median absolute age error (MAE) = 2.1 years (5% of maximum age). This model was more accurate for our data than the previously published methylation clock based on skin samples of common bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus: r = 0.83, MAE = 2.2) and the multi-species odontocete methylation clock (r = 0.68, MAE = 6.8), highlighting that species-specific clocks can have superior performance over those of multi-species assemblages. We further developed an epigenetic sex estimator, predicting sex with 100% accuracy. As age and sex are critical parameters for the study of animal populations, this clock and sex estimator will provide a useful tool for extracting life history information from skin samples rather than long-term observational data for free-ranging Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins worldwide. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Agoa protected marine area, located in the French West Indies, eastern Caribbean, holds several cetacean species, of which the pantropical spotted dolphin Stenella attenuata is the most commonly observed. This species is the focus of whale-watching activities off the leeward coasts of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which has allowed the development of a citizen science program to characterize individuals through the collection of photographic data. Here, we conducted a photo-identification study with a sample of 115,705 photos collected between 2014 and 2019, in which 290 marked individuals (179 in Guadeloupe and 111 in Martinique) were identified. Based on an Agglomerative Hierarchical Classification (AHC) analysis, dolphins from each island were separated into two residency clusters. The Catch–Mark–Release (CMR) POPAN statistical model for open populations estimated the pantropical spotted dolphin populations in Guadeloupe and Martinique at 657 (95% CI: 525–821) and 336 (95% CI: 253–446) individuals for frequent users, respectively, while occasional visitors were estimated at 3,063 (95% CI: 2,133–4,398) and 1,443 (95% CI: 1,024–2,033), respectively. The Martinique population tended to use a reduced coastal area and appeared to be smaller and stable, while the Guadeloupe population showed a slight decline in abundance throughout the study period. These results showed that the leeward coasts of Guadeloupe and Martinique are of particular importance for pantropical spotted dolphin populations, highlighting the need for continued monitoring through both scientific and citizen science programs to fill information gaps on this species in the eastern Caribbean.

ABSTRACT: Population density of the Ganges River Dolphin Platanista gangetica was studied in the Halda River from July to September 2019 and February to April 2022 using the direct count method. The study was conducted from Sattar Khal and ended at Karnafully confluence which covers almost 22 kilometers of area. A total of 6 boat-based sur-veys, 3 trips in 2019 and 3 in 2022 were conducted for making the dolphin estimates within the study area and a total of 112 dolphins were recorded in 2019 and 162 dolphins were recorded in 2022 which indicates an increase in the dolphin population in the Halda River. In 2019 the highest monthly count was in July of a total of 137 dol-phins and in 2022 the highest monthly count was in February of a total of 167 dolphins with best-high-low esti-mates were 29-27-25 and 43-41-45 in July 2019 and February 2022 respectively in the river from the Chayar Char area. The density rate in the entire Halda River was 1.38/km and 2.00/km in 2019 and 2022 respectively. But in the study area, the density of the population was 5.09/km and 7.37/km respectively. These rates are fairly high when compared with any other areas of dolphin distribution in Bangladesh. © TCRP Foundation 2023

ABSTRACT: Integrative taxonomy can help us to gain a better understanding of the degree of evolutionary divergence between taxa. In the western North Atlantic (wNA), two ecotypes (coastal and offshore) of common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, exhibit some external morphological differences, and previous genetic findings suggested that they could be different species. However, their taxonomy remains unsettled. Using an integrative approach comparing traditional and geometric morphometrics, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, we evaluated evolutionary relationships between these ecotypes. We observed congruence among these lines of evidence, strongly indicating that the wNA ecotypes are following distinct evolutionary trajectories. Based on mitochondrial DNA analyses, we detected significant divergence (Nei's dA=0.027), unshared haplotypes and one fixed difference leading to complete diagnosability (percentage diagnosable=100%) of the wNA coastal ecotype. We found morphological diagnosability and negligible nuclear gene flow between the wNA ecotypes. Integration of these multiple lines of evidence revealed that the wNA coastal ecotype is an independent evolutionary unit, appearing to be more closely related to coastal dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea than to their parapatric offshore neighbours, while the offshore dolphins form a relatively cohesive worldwide unit, T. truncatus. We propose that this coastal ecotype is recognized as a distinct species, resurrecting the name Tursiops erebennus. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Investigating the interactions between cetaceans and marine traffic provides us invaluable insight into the extremity of this anthropogenic disturbance. Studying on a spatial scale will allow the identification of key areas where strategic protection must be implemented. The data deficient waters of Montenegro are an important area for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) within the Southern Adriatic Sea. This region faces prevalent boating due to a booming tourism industry and traditional fishery activities, reinforcing the necessity of persistent research and conservation efforts. The current study is Montenegro's only dedicated long-term research effort on cetaceans, with the aim to understand the spatial interaction between bottlenose dolphins and marine traffic. Between 2016 and 2021, data was collected across the coastline of Montenegro through 644 land-based surveys with theodolite stations. During this research effort, dolphins were observed during 187 surveys. The potential effect of vessel density and vessel proximity on dolphin presence as well as the area preference of bottlenose dolphins were investigated. Results indicated that the BokaKotorska was a key area of presence, and that dolphins remained at sites despite there being increasing vessel density. It is important to highlight that <20% of marine vessels observed were within the zone of disturbance (<400m) of focal groups. The results suggest that the coastal waters of Montenegro hold important bottlenose dolphin habitats, with the indication that the ecological benefits of these waters outweigh the cost of marine vessel disturbance. It is key to mention that dolphins are consistently displaying instantaneous marine vessel avoidance across every region of the coastline, emphasizing their negative response towards marine traffic disturbance. Delphinids in Montenegro's coastal waters have exhibited area preference to BokaKotorska, yet this bay has the highest marine vessel density, therefore effective conservation management strategies must be curated for this area and implemented successfully.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The importance of assessing neurochemical processes in the cetacean brain as a tool for monitoring their cognitive health and to indirectly model human neurodegenerative conditions is increasingly evident, although available data are largely semiquantitative. High-resolution MRI for post-mortem brains and stereology allow for quantitative assessments of the cetacean brain. In this study, we scanned two brains of bottlenose dolphins in a 7-Tesla (7T) MR scanner and assessed the connectivity of the inferior colliculi and ventral cochlear nuclei using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Serial thick sections were investigated stereologically in one of the dolphins to generate rigorous quantitative estimates of identifiable cell types according to their morphology and expression of molecular markers, yielding reliable cell counts with most coefficients of error <10%. Fibronectin immunoreactivity in the dolphin resembled the pattern in a human chronic traumatic encephalopathy brain, suggesting that neurochemical compensation for insults such as hypoxia may constitute a noxious response in humans, while being physiological in dolphins. These data contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the morphological and neurochemical properties of the dolphin brain and highlight a stereological and neuroimaging workflow that may enable quantitative and translational assessment of pathological processes in the dolphin brain in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Predictions of population viability can provide valid information for guiding the management and conservation of species. However, such studies are rarely conducted on cetaceans due to limited basic data. In this study, a detailed assessment of the population dynamics of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Xiamen Bay, China was carried out using a Vortex model that was based on model parameters that were derived from monitoring data and published sources. Then, sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the relative importance of the uncertainty of the model parameters. Moreover, potential management models were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in assisting with species recovery. The baseline model projected a decline in the population abundance with a growth rate (r) of -0.031, and the probability of extinction was 58.7% over the next 100 years. The sensitivity analyses revealed that juvenile mortality and fertility were the most pivotal factors for the viability of this population. All the conservation measures, including habitat improvement, catastrophe control, and individual supplementation, contributed to population increases when compared with the baseline model. In particular, decreasing calf and juvenile mortality through habitat improvement, at high levels, was the only way to generate positive growth rates. The findings suggest that these practical management activities can reduce the risk of extinction for this species. Copyright © 2023 Lu, Zhuo, Xu, Chen and Yang.

ABSTRACT: This paper summarises the occurrence of Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) over 12 years (2009 to 2021) in the northwestern Mediterranean. The study was conducted off the central coast of Catalonia (NE Spain) in an area covering 8,026 km2 and featuring a system of submarine canyons. The habitat is suitable for a wide diversity of species, including deep-diving cetaceans. In addition, a different dataset from other projects was included to compare distances to the coast from different periods. A visual effort of 8,756 km was carried out with the recording of 17 Risso’s dolphin sightings. The relative mean density of Risso’s dolphin was 0.0078 individuals/km2 (SD 0.1, n = 17), and the densities were higher in the southern canyons than in the northern canyons. Furthermore, the distance to the coast and the depth of any sighting were compared by gathering data from different periods and surveys (first period 1985–2014; second period 2016–2021) with 34 sightings analysed. Significant differences were found related to the distance to the coast, showing a displacement of the animals to more pelagic areas between periods. The spatial distribution of Risso’s dolphins was investigated by applying a generalized additive model based on sighting data collected during standardized vessel surveys. Four predictive variables were considered, taking into account the local physiographical features. The model showed that the spatial distribution of Risso’s dolphin in the area was related to the slope and slope variation. The species showed preferences for offshore areas as significant differences were obtained in terms of the distance of sightings to the coast. This paper provides new insights into the distribution of Risso’s dolphin in the central western Mediterranean Sea and identifies the submarine canyons of northern Catalonia as an essential habitat for the species.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife management requires reliable demographic information to assess the status of a population and its vulnerability to threats. This study calculated age class- and sex-specific demographic parameters and assessed the viability of a community of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) resident to the Peel-Harvey Estuary in Western Australia. Boat-based photo-identification surveys (n = 483) were conducted between 2016 and 2019. A population viability analysis (PVA) was used to assess the community status and evaluate the effects of adult female and calf mortality, and reproduction on population growth rate. The community comprised 88 (SD = 4.43) individuals with a sex ratio close to parity in all but the adult age class where it was skewed towards females. Demographic changes in this community are driven by births, deaths, and the likely permanent emigration of juvenile males. No immigration was observed. The population is stable (r = −0.004, SD = 0.062) given the current demographic rates. To maintain a community of ~90 individuals, management should consider action to lower adult female and calf mortality. This should involve aiming for zero human caused mortality and ensuring adverse impacts to the population are considered in future development planning. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Affiliative behavior in social animals may have several functions such as maintaining social bonds, reducing tensions, or restoring relationships. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) engage in several affiliative behaviors, including parallel swimming, contact swimming, and flipper rubbing. Dolphins affiliate with former opponents after aggression, suggesting that this is a function of tension reduction. This study investigated how affiliative behaviors occur after aggression. Parallel swimming occurred more frequently than expected after aggression, while contact swimming and flip-per rubbing occurred less frequently than expected. Parallel swimming and contact swimming occurred immediately after aggression; in contrast, flipper rubbing tended to occur more than one minute after aggression. These results suggest that common bot-tlenose dolphins engage in parallel swimming and contact swimming when social tension increases. The function may differ among these affiliative behaviors, and dolphins may engage in specific affiliations after aggression © 2023, Aquatic Mammals.All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: As the first line of defense, the integumentary system is critical in comprehensively evaluating dolphin morbidity during stranding response. Most published studies on skin lesions in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) lack standardized gross descriptions and methodologies for evaluating lesions. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an assessment matrix designed to consistently describe skin lesions based on a set of standardized gross description characteristics. The matrix was implemented by reviewing necropsy reports, histopathology reports, and photographs collected from bottlenose dolphins stranded in Southwest Florida from 2015 through 2019. Of the 32 dolphins that met the inclusion criteria, 19 presented with skin lesions and five reviewers described each of the 46 lesions according to a novel, standardized assessment matrix. The most common descriptor selected, in each of the respective matrix categories, were, by anatomic location, head; distribution, multifocal to coalescing; quantity, moderate (10–30); size, <2 cm; shape, punctate; margin, rounded; color modifier, hyperpigmentation; texture, smooth; and texture modifier, flat. These prevalent descriptors coincided with the frequent occurrence of histologically described hydropic degeneration (n=7, 15.2%) and were confirmed poxviral lesions in 6.52% (n=3). Identifying lesion patterns using standardized descriptors capitalizes on the unique pathogen tissue tropism and the implementation of certain disease mechanisms in the integumentary system. Therefore, it can facilitate differential disease diagnoses and guide ancillary diagnostics testing. The use of standardized descriptors will aid in etiologic identification and monitoring of skin lesions and associated diseases, advancing our understanding of dolphin morbidity and mortality.

ABSTRACT: P. 178. There is an error in the 5th paragraph on the page.

ABSTRACT: Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) in the Azores maintain a sexually stratified community with males forming stable clusters, whereas females tend to associate in temporally stable units when calving and nursing. Large relative testes size indicates a mating system based on sperm competition. Small sexual size dimorphism and long interbirth intervals may facilitate male cooperation. We describe mating tactics observed in a resident population of Risso’s dolphins based on data collected over 8 consecutive years. We distinguished groups by sex and age class and analyzed peaceful and aggressive behaviors using an ethogram. Males displayed a variety of mating tactics described in cetaceans, spanning display, contest, endurance, and scramble competition, in the assumed context of sperm competition. We observed rare behaviors including male care for neonates but also intense aggression toward newborn calves, leading to possible infanticide. Females’ mating tactics included evasive behaviors and signal discrimination. We hypothesize that male mating tactics of Risso’s dolphins are related to age class. For females, the polygynandrous mating system may serve to improve fertility, reduce sexual harass-ment, and reduce the risk of infanticide. Adult females seem to prefer older over younger male groups, suggesting that some level of female mate choice exists in this species. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies on dolphin electrocardiograms have shown that they are mainly composed of increased negative waves, similar to ungulates. The electrocardiogram waveform was determined by the distribution of the Purkinje fibers. Based on the waveform of the dolphin electrocardiogram, Hamlin predicted that the Purkinje fibers would be distributed within the ventricular muscle, as in ungulates. The purpose of this study was to confirm the histological distribution of Purkinje fibers in dolphins. In the present study, bottlenose dolphin hearts were observed both grossly and histologically, and the effects of Purkinje fiber distribution and cardiac morphology on electrocardiogram waveforms were examined. This study showed that the Purkinje fibers of dolphins run just below the endocardium, as in humans, dogs, and cats, whose electrocardiograms mainly show positive waves. When the cardiac morphology of dolphins was observed carefully, the right ventricle was found to be extremely dilated compared to that of terrestrial mammals. In human recreational divers, right ventricular dilatation is induced by diving. We hypothesized that the dolphin’s heart is in a state similar to that of the right heart dilatation in terrestrial animals. The dolphin electrocardiogram waveform was considered to be due to right axis deviation. Based on the above, we concluded that the dolphin electrocardiogram waveform was due to its ability to live in water. We found that the dolphins are genetically related to ungulates, particularly the hippopotamus, but that their hearts have evolved differently. © 2023 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: A 25-day-old male common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) died suddenly while swimming at a dolphinarium. The gross examination revealed ulceration on the dorsal and pectoral fins and rostrum. Severe congestion, hemorrhage, and edema were observed in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, lungs, and kidneys. Fibrinosuppurative arthritis of the atlantooccipital joint and extension of fibrin into the spinal canal caused compression of the spinal cord. Histopathological examination revealed tracheitis, fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia and enteritis. In the central nervous system, meningeal vessel congestion in the brain, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages with neurodegeneration were observed in the spinal cord. Based on the histopathological findings, representative samples, including lung, liver, mesenteric lymph node, blood obtained from the jugular vein, and fluid sample of the ascites, were inoculated on tryptic soy agar and blood agar for routine bacterial isolation. Each isolated bacterial colony was streaked aseptically onto tryptic soy agar and blood agar for pure culture. After then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for further identification of pathogenic microorganisms. PCR identified Escherichia fergusonii, Shewanella haliotis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus schleiferi. E. fergusonii was considered the primary etiologic agent in this case since it was the only species identified in all representative samples. The cause of death in this animal was E. fergusonii sepsis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of neonatal sepsis associated with E. fergusonii infection in a dolphin, and suggests E. fergusonii as an opportunistic pathogen associated with sepsis in dolphins.

ABSTRACT: AbstractAtlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)are frequently observed in the coastal waters of Palm Beach County, Florida. In this study, mark-recapture surveys using photo-identification tech-niques were used to estimate population abun-dance of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins in this area for the first time. Surveys were conducted for 11 years, between 2005 and 2016, during which 384 individuals were identified and catalogued from distinctive nicks and notches on their dorsal fins. Each marked individual was documented an aver-age of 2.4 times (range 1 to 19). Low resighting rates and a constant rate of encounter with pre-viously unmarked individuals suggest that the population is open, comprising both residents and transients. The Jolly-Seber method was used to estimate population abundance. Estimates of abundance varied greatly in time with an overall average of 264 individuals and a 95% confidence interval of 162 to 366 (SE = 51.3), indicating a variable population size. As threats in the region continue to rise, such as overfishing, toxic algae blooms, and environmental pollutants, this under-studied population may be vulnerable to decline. A better understanding of the population dynam-ics could facilitate more effective conservation action. © 2023,Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Plastic pollution has not raised much attention until the 2000s, despite being manufactured for about a century. It is now considered one of the most substantial environmental issues. Here we investigate the presence of plastic contamination in 34 stranded animals on the coast of French Guiana, South America. Here we present information highlighting the magnitude of plastic contamination in marine coastal and pelagic tropical marine vertebrates on the Equatorial Atlantic coast of South America. All four species studied here are protected and emblematic vertebrates of the region, with a fragile conservation status, including the olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea, the green turtle Chelonia mydas and the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, and a small cetacean, the Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis. Macroplastics (polypropylene, polyethylene, terephthalate, and polystyrene) were detected in four juvenile green turtles. Microplastics (polypropylene, polyethylene, terephthalate, polystyrene, nylon, acrylates, polycarbonates) were found in 13 individuals (two dolphins, six olive ridleys, four green turtles, and the leatherback turtle). The sampled species have different diets, distribution patterns, and ages, suggesting widespread plastic pollution. The study area is located far from the oceanic gyres. However, they are influenced by the North Brazilian Current, the Amazon River, and other rivers of the Guianas. © 2023, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis bairdii) distribution is limited to the Eastern North Pacific Ocean. Its whistle repertoire is poorly investigated, with no studies in the Gulf of California. The aim of the present study is to characterize the whistles of this species and compare their parameters with different populations. Acoustic monitoring was conducted in La Paz Bay, Gulf of California. Recordings were inspected in spectrogram view in Raven Pro, selecting good quality whistles (n = 270). In the software Luscinia, contours were manually traced to obtain whistle frequencies and duration. Number of steps, inflection points and contour type were visually determined. We calculated the descriptive statistics of the selected whistle parameters and we compared the results with a dolphins population from the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed to test the intraspecific variation of the whistle parameters among groups. In the present study the mean values (±SD) of the whistle parameters were: maximum frequency = 14.13 ± 3.71 kHz, minimum frequency = 8.44 ± 2.58 kHz and duration = 0.44 ± 0.31 s. Whistles with the upsweep contour were the most common ones (34.44%). The coefficient of variation (CV ) values for modulation parameters were high (>100%), in accordance with other studies on dolphins. Whistle parameters showed significant differences among groups. Finally, ending and maximum frequencies, duration and inflection points of the whistles recorded in the present study were lower compared with the parameters of the long-beaked common dolphins from the Eastern Pacific Ocean. This study provides the first whistle characterization of long-beaked common dolphin from the Gulf of California and it will help future passive acoustic monitoring applications in the study area.

ABSTRACT: Ecotoxicological and pathological research on Grampus griseus (Cuvier, 1812) (Risso's dolphins) is scarce both globally and in the Mediterranean Sea. This species has been classified as “Vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the Mediterranean Sea. To evaluate the presence of “persistent organic pollutants” (POPs), especially organochlorine compounds (OCs), in the animals, chemical analyses were performed on tissues and organs of Risso's dolphin stranded along the Italian coasts between 1998 and 2021. Toxic contaminants such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) were examined in the blubber, liver, muscle, and brain of 20 animals, and data was correlated with sex, age, and stranding locations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Context. Exmouth Gulf is adjacent to the Ningaloo Marine Park, a UNESCO-listed area in Western Australia. The gulf remains largely unprotected, and is under increasing anthropogenic pressure from proposed industrial activities that pose threats to marine megafauna inhabiting the gulf. Threatened and near threatened species, such as the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), reside in the gulf; however, detailed information on their ecology and behaviour is lacking. Aims. The aim was to (1) provide baseline data on the distribution, encounter rate, group size and behaviour of coastal dolphins over an area where current industrial developments are proposed, and (2) report on the occurrence of other marine megafauna within this area. Methods. Boat-based photo-identification surveys were conducted on the western coastline of Exmouth Gulf along predetermined line transects (150 km2) over austral autumn/winter 2021. Key results. Across 809.35 km of surveyed waters (181 h), a total of 93 bottlenose dolphin, 15 humpback dolphin, and six interspecific dolphin groups were sighted. Bottlenose dolphin groups were encountered at a rate of 0.077/km, humpback dolphin groups at 0.015/km and interspecific dolphin groups at 0.005/km. Dolphins were predominantly recorded in shallow (mean 10 m) and warm (mean 21°C) waters, and were commonly travelling and foraging. In total, 199 individual bottlenose dolphins and 48 humpback dolphins were photo-identified (excluding calves). There were 30 bottlenose dolphin calves (including three newborns) and four humpback dolphin calves (including two newborns) identified. Other marine megafauna group sightings included humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae; n = 32), southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, n = 1), dugongs (Dugong dugon, n = 25), turtles (n = 54), sea snakes (n = 27), manta rays (Mobula alfredi, n = 13) and sharks (n = 2). Conclusions. The presence of threatened marine species feeding, socialising, and resting highlights the importance of these waters for the identified species. Implications. The information provided is applicable for the spatial management and conservation efforts of these species, and aids in informing environmental impact assessments of individual and cumulative pressures. © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

ABSTRACT: Demographic changes can result in alterations of social structure and behavior which in turn may affect survival, reproduction, or movement and may influence how populations respond to changes in the environment. In 2013, 52 Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) left Little Bahama Bank (LBB) and immigrated into a resident group of spotted dolphins on Great Bahama Bank (GBB). Initially there was little interaction and two distinct social clusters delineated by residency status. Here we describe the social structure of the dolphins on GBB between 2015–2020. Analyses were conducted with SOCPROG 2.9 and coefficients of association were nonrandom. The number of associations between LBB and GBB individuals increased, and standardized lagged association rates indicated continued associations over time. Modularity analysis showed one community without clear social clusters, although there were preferential associations within the original communities. Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure indicated that sex, age, and residency status were good predictor variables that explained the patterns of the association indices. Male alliances were present between LBB, GBB, and LBB/GBB males. New and old relationships are influencing the social restructuring of this community. This study furthers our understanding of how demographic changes can shape the social structure of a population. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Temporal and geographical changes in the infections of intestinal helminths of striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba were investigated in waters off the Spanish Mediterranean coast based on a sample of 233 dolphins stranded during 1982-2016. The influence of host-related factors (length and sex) and seasonality was also examined. Four helminth species had a prevalence > 5%, including adults of three cestodes, i.e, Trigonocotyle globicephalae (prevalence: 5.2%), Tetrabothrius forsteri (94.4%) and Strobilocephalus triangularis (18%); and juveniles of an acanthocephalan of the genus Bolbosoma (15.9%), identified as B. capitatum using molecular techniques. One immature specimen of Diphyllobothrium sp. (Cestoda) was also found in a single dolphin, and two juveniles of Bolbosoma balaenae in two dolphins. Trigonocotyle globicephalae seems to have low specificity for striped dolphins and was only found sporadically. Tetrabothrius forsteri and S. triangularis experienced a slight vs. a strong decrease, followed by a recovery, in infection levels throughout the study period, which are compatible with a reduction in the striped dolphin population caused by the Dolphin Morbillivirus outbreak in 1990. Infections of B. capitatum, a parasite typical from pilot whales, suddenly increased in 1990, then vanished. This rapid increase and following decrease are puzzling and can hardly be explained by a single factor. Infections of any helminth species were apparently uncorrelated to geographic origin, dolphin sex or season, but parasite load decreased with dolphin length in the case of T. forsteri and S. triangularis. To our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of multi-decadal changes in cetacean parasites. Copyright © 2023 García-Gallego, Raga, Fraija-Fernández and Aznar.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated the use of diazepam (Valium®) during the rehabilitation of odontocetes (dol-phins and porpoises) to facilitate husbandry and for veterinary purposes, by analyzing detailed records from a period of 14 years of the treatment of 16 stranded individuals: harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), a common dol-phin (Delphinus delphis), and a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). Diazepam was used occasionally (once per case or for a few days at a time) to facilitate husbandry, including for man-aging stressful and transitional circumstances and during transport. It was also used occasion-ally (once per case) for veterinary purposes, such as to reduce stress or to facilitate x-ray scanning, gastroscopy, blood sampling, or wound treat-ment. Diazepam was found to be effective as an anti-anxiety drug, to cause drowsiness (i.e., reduce activity levels), as a muscle relaxant, and as an appetite stimulant. The doses used were similar for husbandry and veterinary purposes (0.03 to 0.44 mg/kg body weight), and the drug was administered almost exclusively orally (via fish) or via intramuscular injection. © 2023,Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Nowadays, zoos and aquariums, along with the constant advancement of sociocultural moral values, are proactively committed to ensuring and safeguarding cetacean health standards. This entails developing new approaches to health assessments by embracing minimally invasive sampling methods and enhanced animal handling and management, among other aspects. Hence, in the present survey, to appraise skin diseases, the implementation of cytology cell samplers as a non-invasive skin sampling device on 18 bottlenose dolphins housed in two facilities in the Canary Islands during the months of April, October, and December 2019 was performed to isolate cetacean poxvirus in tattoo-like lesions through a real-time PCR-based method using the DNA polymerase gene. Samples were repeatedly collected over time from eleven tattoo-like lesions and from apparently healthy skin to serve as a control for all study animals. From a total of 55 skin samples, detection of the poxvirus was attained in 31 (56.36%); specifically, on 20 of 21 samples collected from tattoo-like lesions (95.23%) and on 11 of 34 samples acquired from apparently healthy skin (32.35%). Correspondingly, the current study constitutes the first report of the isolation of cetacean poxvirus in skin samples without macroscopical signs of tattoo lesions in cetaceans. Likewise, ten of the eleven dolphins that showed tattoo lesions housed in Facility 1 were positive for tattoo skin disease, while four dolphins held in Facility 2 were positive for cetacean poxvirus without ever showing clinical evidence of the disease. This raises the question of whether this pathogen can produce latent infections and whether progression of the disease may depend on environmental stimuli, viral load, or the good health/immunological status of individual animals. Accordingly, further scientific research on cetaceans under human care could provide the knowledge, skills, and resources to understand the host–pathogen dynamics of cetacean poxviruses and their effect on cetaceans’ health.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are marine mammals with unique anatomical structures in their airways. These particular respiratory structures make dolphins very sensitive to microorganisms in the air, and the habitats of dolphins in captivity and in the wild are quite different. This causes captive dolphins to suffer from illnesses, especially respiratory diseases. Previous studies have shown that the respiratory flora plays an essential role in the health of humans and animals. Therefore, by comparative analysis of the respiratory flora of wild dolphins and dolphins in captivity, we want to find the flora related to dolphins respiratory diseases, and try to improve dolphin health through flora homeostasis. For this purpose, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analyses. We found that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Campilobacterota, Paracoccus, and other flora differed between wild and healthy and sub-healthy captive dolphins. Some of them are the dominant flora for promoting health, and the others may be essential pathogenic bacteria in the sub-healthy state of dolphins in captivity. © 2023 Brill Academic Publishers.

ABSTRACT: The coastal bottlenose dolphin is well studied throughout its natural range, though most research focuses on wide, well-protected habitats such as bays and estuaries rather than on narrow coastal sand banks. This study identifies a residential group of coastal bottlenose dolphins utilizing the northwestern Atlantic waters off the coast of Palm Beach County, Florida. From 2014 to 2020, 313 boat surveys were conducted, and 585 individual dolphins were identified using photo-identification. Using seasonal and annual resighting ratios, 24 dol-phins were considered full-time residents, 66 dol-phins were considered part-time residents, and 478 dolphins were transient. The presence of individu-als with high site fidelity indicates that the region is used as a permanent habitat for some individuals, while the presence of transient animals may indi-cate a possible bridge between populations living to the north and south of the region © 2023, Aquatic Mammals.All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) are a coastal species found in Thai waters off the coasts of the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. This species was recently re-listed as near-threatened by the IUCN Red List, though the population status in Thai seas is not known. Here, we investigated genetic diversity, population structure, maternal lineage, and demographics by analyzing skin tissue samples (n = 30) of T. aduncus stranded along the Andaman coastline of Thailand between 1990 and 2019. This study was based on 11 microsatellite loci and 265 bp mtDNA control regions compared to data available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). From microsatellites, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.46 to 0.85. The mean fixation index (F) value for all loci was 0.10 ± 0.04, which suggests some degree of inbreeding. Two genetic clusters (the most likely K at K = 2) were observed in T. aduncus through the population structure analysis using multiple criteria. For the mtDNA control region, a total of 17 haplotypes were found for dolphins in Thai seas (14 haplotypes from our samples; three haplotypes from the NCBI database) with high levels of haplotype diversity (h) at 0.926 ± 0.027 and nucleotide diversity (π) at 0.045 ± 0.002. A decline in the effective population size from 0.05 million years ago also was observed in Thai T. aduncus through Bayesian Skyline Plots analysis. A unique set of haplotypes was identified in our samples, which may have originated from the Australian and Indian Oceans rather than the Western Pacific Ocean. These results improve our understanding of the maternal lineage of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, which can be used for monitoring population status and establishing better conservation plans for this species in the Thai Andaman Sea. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is an endangered freshwater species found in the rivers of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The development of dams and barrages have severely affected this habitat as dolphins move into irrigation canals where they are at risk of injury or death due to a range of factors, such as rapidly receding waters, heat stroke, drowning and human interference. Between 2013–20, the TSA Foundation India and the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Department, Uttar Pradesh, rescued 24 dolphins in 18 entrapment events. While 19 dolphins were rescued, five died during capture or transportation. Here we describe our capture and transportation methods to raise awareness of the issue and improve survival rates in future entrapment events. © 2023 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: California coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) comprise a distinct ecotype that typi-cally inhabits waters < 1 km from shore and about 10 to 30 m deep, often to the surf zone (Defran & Weller, 1999; Defran et al., 1999; Bearzi et al., 2009; Perrin et al., 2011). An offshore bottlenose dolphin ecotype is found in deeper waters of California, usually more than a few kilometers from shore to well beyond the continental shelf edge (Defran & Weller, 1999; Bearzi et al., 2009; Perrin et al., 2011; Lowther-Thieleking et al., 2014). The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) manages these ecotypes as separate stocks (Carretta et al., 2017), differentiated by cranial morphology, diet, parasite load (Walker, 1981; Perrin et al., 2011), and genetics (Lowther-Thieleking et al., 2014). The two forms, however, cannot be reliably identified in the field based on external appearance (Walker, 1981; Leatherwood et al., 1982) © 2023, Aquatic Mammals.All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: The evaluation of circulating concentrations of cor-tisol associated with controlled cessation of suck-ling encompassing the weaning process in bottle-nose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under managed care has fundamental and practical implications to enhance and improve management and welfare practices. This study involved five cow–calf pairs of which calves were 12 to 19 months at weaning and accustomed to a fish diet. Blood samples were collected from cows and calves between 0800 and 1100 h episodically for two weeks before weaning day (Day 0) and on Days 1, 3, 5, 8 12, 16, 20, and 31 post-weaning. Pre-weaning involved condition-ing through positive reinforcement with respective trainers where cows moved freely from maternity to holding pens while calves remained in maternity pens. After 2 to 6 months, when cows and calves remained separated for at least several minutes with-out reuniting, weaning day was initiated, and gates between maternity and holding pens were closed. Physical separation resulted in cows and calves exhibiting different types and degrees of behavior dominated by increased vocalization and locomotor activities (rapid and erratic swimming, side jump-ing, breaching). While pre-weaning cortisol con-centrations were at baseline and not different (p > 0.1) between cows and calves, post-weaning con-centrations on Day 1 increased in cows (p = 0.0045) and calves (p = 0.0001), reaching higher (p < 0.07) concentrations in calves than in cows. Thereafter, cortisol decreased to pre-weaning concentrations on Day 5 (p = 0.0031) in cows and Day 12 (p = 0.0417) in calves. While stress-like behavior post-weaning returned to pre-weaning conditions by Day 5 in cows and calves, cortisol remained slightly higher (p < 0.1) in calves than in cows until the study ended on Day 31. Thus, although preliminary, the acute, temporal physiological and behavioral responses to the cessation of suckling encompassing weaning in dolphin cow–calf pairs are novel and provide a basis for future studies to comprehensively evaluate short and long-term physiological and behavioral relationships associated with weaning in dolphins under managed care. © 2023, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Climate change caused by human industrialization is an unavoidable global problem which started in the 20th century. The high concentration of greenhouse gases has caused global warming, natural disaster, rising sea level, and threatened marine wildlife. It has been proven to decrease the survival rate of dolphins by 12%. This research aims to describe the behavior and assess the readiness to release rehabilitated Tursiops aduncus in Umah Lumba, Banyuwedang Bay, Bali, to boost the wild dolphin population. Visual observation was made on three individuals: Rambo, Rocky and Johnny, at Umah Lumba, Banyuwedang Bay Bali, on March 2021, who have been in the rehabilitation facility since September 2019. The three individuals can be identified by the physical characteristics of their head, mandible, and dorsal fin. The dolphins have developed nine wild-dolphin-like behaviors: respiratory, exploratory, resting, reproductive, social, predatory, spy-hopping, tail-clapping, and sneezing. This rehabilitation program is essential because it increases the population of wild dolphins by acclimating, adapting, and training former captive dolphins for release.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Multiple techniques have been used for estimating age in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The longest established technique is via counts of growth later groups (GLGs) in the longitudinal section of an extracted mandibular tooth. Previous studies to validate GLGs have primarily used younger dolphins (less than 16yrs old) due to the limited number of known age older animals. This study assessed the accuracy of age estimates for bottlenose dolphins using both GLG analysis and a newer technique, pectoral flipper radiography (PFR) for dolphins ranging from 0 to 58yrs, with a majority of samples (70%) over 16yrs. GLGs were assessed by two expert independent readers on tooth sections from 52 different dolphins (85% over 16yrs, maximum age 58yrs), and assessments of PFRs were performed by two experienced veterinarians on 37 dolphins (54% over 16yrs, maximum age 54yrs). Results demonstrated both techniques became less accurate in older dolphins, particularly those > 30yrs, with errors as large as 37yrs for GLG estimates. The root mean squared error (RMSE) for age estimation using GLGs for dolphins ≤15 years of age was 1.46yrs compared to 1.58yrs using PFRs demonstrating the accuracy of both techniques in this age bracket. For dolphins >30yrs, RMSE increased to 17yrs in GLG aging and 8.25yrs in PFR. Challenges in obtaining accurate age estimates in GLGs were primarily due to sectioning and staining difficulties in visualizing the newest GLG layers, in the very old animals. Complications in reading the layers included obtaining a good section, the presence of accessory layers, GLG compression, and tooth curvature or wear removing the neonatal line influencing aging biases. In pectoral flipper aging, the primary challenge was obtaining a true dorsoventral radiograph in a live dolphin during a health assessment, as well as the subjective assessment of scoring and reliance on degenerative changes accurately estimate age in geriatric dolphins. While access to the radiography equipment can be a limiting factor, the improved accuracy for age estimation in adult dolphins, the less invasive nature, and reduced processing time to results make pectoral radiography a preferred alternative technique for estimating age in live dolphins.

ABSTRACT: To understand the community structure of zooplankton and assess the survivability of the Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP), a field investigation of seasonal variation of zooplankton and environmental parameters was conducted in the Nanjing Yangtze Dolphin Nature Reserve (NYDNR) from October 2021 to August 2022. The results showed that: (1) a total of 54 species were identified, and the number of species belonging to protozoa, rotifer, cladocera, and copepods was 19, 12, 11 and 12, respectively; (2) the total zooplankton density was 21571.65 ind./L, dominated by protozoa (89.7%), and the total biomass was 6.6762 mg/L, dominated by rotifer (28.0%) and copepods (48.2%); (3) the assessment results of water quality showed that the NYDNR was classified as mesotrophic level, it was indicated that the water quality of the NYDNR satisfied the living requirement for YFP; (4) the fish productivity in the NYDNR is about 43139.34 kg, which could meet the nutrition requirements of 28 YFPs, and fish potential productivity estimation through zooplankton showed that food sources of YFP were being threatened. The results of this study not only improved the understanding of the community structure of zooplankton, but also have important implication to the protection of YFP in the NYDNR. © 2023, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present a machine learning technique based on artificial intelligence (AI) Neural Network (NN) and its application to the classification of underwater sounds, underwater noise, and underwater sounds of marine mammals (dolphins, cetaceans) recorded by hydrophones. The data collection process generates a large amount of underwater sound recordings, which are very time consuming to process by humans and, due to the monotonous nature of the work, there is a high potential for human error and human inattention. Considering these aspects, the possibility of applying artificial intelligence to post-process the sound recordings, classifying the sounds, up to the level of species recognition in the case of cetaceans and dolphins, and up to the level of vessel type recognition in the case of vessel traffic noise, has been raised. Artificial intelligence and deep learning tools greatly assist in the machine analysis of vast amounts of data and automated categorization. With the help of the trained model, it can be estimated which of the previously categorized types is characteristic of a new audio clip. We tested the accuracy of this method and concluded that our machine-learning sound classification has the best accuracy more than 93% when processing and classifying underwater hydrophone sound recordings with high background shipping and tourist boats' underwater noise, recorded during our fieldwork on the Adriatic Sea.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Strandings of striped dolphins (SD) and short-finned pilot whales (PW) in Hokkaido, northern Japan, are rare but have recently increased, probably due to global warming. We quantified δ 13C, δ 15N, and δ 18O in muscles of SD (n = 7) and PW (n = 3) stranded in Hokkaido and compared these values with those in muscles (red meat products) of hunted SD and PW in three areas of central and southern Japan. δ 18O in stranded SD, except for the calf, decreased with increasing body length (BL), whereas δ 13C increased, with no BL-related changes in δ 15N. The variability of δ 18O (range of maximum and minimum) was larger in the stranded SD (7.5 ‰) than of the hunted SD in three areas (0.9, 1.9, and 1.4 ‰), whereas that of δ 15N was smaller in the stranded SD than in the hunted SD. Similarly, the variability of δ 18O was larger in the stranded PW in Hokkaido (3.3 ‰) than in the hunted PW in central Japan (1.4 ‰). The larger variability of δ 18O and smaller variability of δ 15N in stranded SD imply long-term sojourning in coastal waters and feeding on small amounts of limited prey species at low trophic levels before death. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Basic knowledge about populations of short‐beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea is still lacking. Classified as 'Endangered' in an IUCN assessment released in 2022, it is necessary to gain baseline knowledge to understand the species' population status and develop impactful conservation measures. The current study conducted boat surveys, employing visual and acoustic techniques between January 2019 and July 2022 in the Dilek Peninsula National Park, central Aegean Sea. Results revealed the continuous coastal presence of common dolphins, with subadults recorded during every sighting in low group sizes. Travelling‐related activities made up 58% of observed behaviour while resting comprised just 1%. Whistles were produced in the range of 1.83-48kHz with a peak frequency of 10.4kHz and median duration of 0.54s. Concave whistles were the most frequently recorded whistle type. Whistles were found to be generated when dolphins were interacting with boats and diving/travelling fast, forming 53% and 31% of whistle production respectively. The continuous presence of common dolphins, particularly subadults, emphasises the importance of the Dilek Peninsula. Whistle parameters show similarities with other common dolphin populations of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, albeit with shorter durations. The high whistle presence during boat interactions requires investigation to assess whether whistles carry avoidance or predatory messages, or whether there are potential consequences for the species' energy budget. The current study presents preliminary information on the behavioural context of acoustic patterns. Further research is essential to understand the click and whistle characteristics within the biological, environmental and anthropogenic variables of their surroundings. © 2023 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: The Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) has a distinctive vertical crease (or cleft) along the anterior surface of the forehead. Previous studies have speculated that the cleft may contribute to biosonar beam formation. To explore this, we constructed 2D finite element models based on computer tomography data of the head of a naturally deceased Risso’s dolphin. The simulated acoustic near-field signals, far-field signals, and transmission beam patterns were compared to corresponding measurements from a live, echolocating Risso’s dolphin. To investigate the effect of the cleft, we filled the cleft with neighboring soft tissues in our model, creating a hypothetical “cleftless” forehead, as found in other odontocetes. We compared the acoustic pressure field and the beam pattern between the clefted and cleftless cases. Our results suggest that the cleft plays an insignificant role in forehead biosonar sound propagation and far-field beam formation. Furthermore, the cleft was not responsible for the bimodal click spectrum recorded and reported from this species. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in mechanisms of flow and turbulence control inspired by aquatic animals. This includes passive mechanisms such as the boundary roughness changes found on shark skin, as well as active boundary modulation, inspired by the viscoelastic properties of dolphin skin. In this work, we present a novel device to control boundary morphology and impact near-boundary flow. We developed this device as a 5-by-5 actuator array, using voice coil motors, and implemented it in the wall of a laminar-to-turbulent flow channel. The actuators are overlaid by a flexible membrane and embedded in the wall of the channel. Each actuator can be controlled individually, and the system can generate wave patterns on the boundary along or across the flow direction. The boundary deformation patterns were quantified using a computer vision approach. The system was tested to assess its impact on near-boundary velocity and turbulence. A DPIV (Digital Particle Image Velocimetry) system was used to quantify velocity fields. Velocity decomposition showed that boundary actuation impacts the mean boundary layer velocity profile. The impact on near-boundary velocity was found to be consistent with a reduction in frictional drag. A numerical tank was set up using Computational Fluid Dynamics, and the results from the model support the laboratory findings. To our knowledge, this is the first such device allowing boundary modulation using individual actuator control that has been implemented and tested in direct contact with water with the impact on flow assessed. A successful implementation of such a device in a natural underwater environment could lead to wide-ranging benefits including increased platform energy-efficiency and reduction of flow-induced noise.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Postmortem Attentive Behaviors (PABs), also known as epimeletic behaviors, have been observed in terrestrial mammalian species, such as primates, giraffes, and elephants (Nakamichi et al., 1996; Douglas-Hamilton et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012; Strauss & Muller, 2013), as well as in aquatic mam-mals (Reggente et al., 2016; Bearzi & Reggente, 2017; Bearzi et al., 2017). In cetaceans, epimeletic behavior is described as one or more adults attending to an injured, distressed, dying, or deceased animal by keeping it afloat if sinking, pushing it down if buoyant, performing “resuscitation” attempts, and/or carrying it on the dorsum, head, rostrum, or in the mouth (Reggente et al., 2016; Bearzi & Reggente, 2017). Most records of cetacean PAB involved Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) (e.g., Porter, 2002; Kuczaj et al., 2015; Bearzi et al., 2017, 2018; Cheng et al., 2018; Reggente et al., 2018; Pedrazzi et al., 2022). Until now, only one case of this behavior has been documented in Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella bre-virostris) from Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia (Kreb et al., 2020). Herein, we describe a rare event of PAB towards an Irrawaddy dolphin calf in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, East Malaysia, and its implications for conservation. © 2023,Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic signals play a crucial role in communication among animals, particularly in dolphins. Signature whistles, one of their most extensively studied vocalizations, enable dolphins to convey their identity to conspecifics through individually distinct whistle contours. However, it remains unclear whether rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) also produce signature whistles with individually identifying contours and, if so, whether they are associated with stress and poor health, such as in bottlenose dolphins. To bridge this knowledge gap, we recorded sounds emitted by a live-stranded rough-toothed dolphin during its rehabilitation in May 2017 at Isla Mujeres, Quintana Roo, Mexico. We assessed if the dolphin produced a signature whistle and whether whistle rate, inter-whistle interval, mean low and high frequencies, and blood chemistry measures, changed significantly over time. While isolated from conspecifics during rehabilitation, the dolphin generated a single, repeated, and stereotyped whistle contour that met the previously established SIGnature IDentification criteria for signature whistle emissions for bottlenose dolphins. Whistle characteristics varied over the 11 recording days: whistle rate and inter-whistle interval significantly decreased over time; the number of whistles with preceding echolocation click trains decreased over time; and mean low and high frequencies changed over recording days. We conclude that this rough-toothed dolphin possessed what resembles a signature whistle contour, and the emission of this contour underwent significant changes throughout the rehabilitation process. While our study presents evidence of a single rough-toothed dolphin producing a signature whistle, further research is necessary to determine whether this vocal behavior is prevalent across the species.

ABSTRACT: Abnormal coloration shaped as small patches on a body or fins/tail flukes of cetaceans is relatively rare, although such cases have been recorded in multiple species. Several reports of anomalously colored dolphins and porpoises have been documented in the coastal waters of the Black Sea, with uneven distribution across the basin. Recently, during photoidentification (photo-ID) surveys conducted between 2022 and 2023, atypically pigmented bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) individuals with white patches on their dorsal fins and bodies were spotted in Turkish territorial waters near Zonguldak Province. The analysis of photographs from these sightings offers a simple approach to detect and characterize different types of skin coloration of cetaceans inhabiting the south-western waters of the Black Sea. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: The preference tests have made a great contribution to promoting animal welfare. However, they are not always easily applicable and have some criticalities. Recently the anticipatory behavior has been used to detect the animals’ preference. In this study, we attempted to investigate the relationship between preference and anticipatory behavior. To this end, we tested on a group of dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) whether, with anticipatory behavior, it is possible to distinguish the animals’ preference for different objects and then use it as a preference test. Anticipatory behavior is exhibited throughout the animal kingdom, it is easy to induce and measure, and does not have the criticalities of other preference tests. Therefore, its use as preference test could facilitate the study of animals' preferences and contribute to the promotion of their welfare. Our results support the hypothesis of use anticipatory behavior as a preference test. In fact, dolphins have anticipated the arrival of objects highly preferred with a frequency three times higher than shown toward objects less preferred, providing further evidence of the correlation between anticipatory behavior and the animals’ preference. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The study aimed to report a confirmed stranding record of an adult female Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) from the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. This species is classified as "Least Concern" in the Mediterranean by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The individual, which was first seen alive from the Erdemli shores of Mersin Bay on 10 April 2023, was tried to push back into the water after being stranded ashore. After the individual died, the corpse was brought to Mersin University Marine Life Museum for external examination. It was determined that the individual weighed 360 kg and had a length of 330 cm. Many old and new scars were found on the individual's skin. It was understood that the newly formed deep cut marks on the head area were caused by the individual hitting the fishing nets. The study is the confirmed stranding of an adult female Risso's dolphin record in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. © 2023, Natural and Engineering Science. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis in Hong Kong (HK) waters are part of a large (ca. 2000−2500), but declining, population that occurs in the Pearl River Estuary of southern China. To understand the factors that may influence dolphin densities in 4 different parts of HK, a 25 yr (1996−2020) database containing 66 439 km of line-transect survey effort and 4052 dolphin sightings was used. Seventeen variables representing natural and anthropogenic habitat factors were evaluated using generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify the preferred habitat of humpback dolphins in HK waters. In the environmental GAMs, rainfall, salinity, and river discharge were significant factors related to dolphin density, consistent with their observed strong preference for estuarine habitat. Sea surface temperature was also important for one of the 4 subareas. In the anthropogenic GAMs, the only significant variable was the amount of habitat area lost to land reclamation in North Lantau. This finding is consistent with previous hypotheses that heavy coastal engineering in North Lantau has contributed to observed declines in dolphin abundance during the study period. This study provides some of the first quantitative indications of factors that are potentially influencing the density of the animals in various parts of HK. As such, it will be a valuable tool for evaluating and mitigating potential impacts of both natural and anthropogenic factors on the population in the future. © The authors 2023.

ABSTRACT: Ten skulls of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) collected from various locations along the coast of Pakistan were examined. The skulls were initially divided into two groups, Group-A (n = 7) and Group-B (n = 3), based on specific morphological characters. The data were further tested statistically using Student’s t-test and violin plots. The results clustered the specimens into two morphological groups. Twelve morphological variables recommended for visual identification distinctly categorised skulls in two groups (e.g., small cranium with longer/slender rostrum (Group-A) versus stockier and wider skull (Group-B); presence of premaxillary convexity in the lateral view and premaxilla pinch in the dorsal view on the rostrum (Group-A); temporal fossa rounded (Group-A) versus small and elongated in shape (Group-B); teeth counts). The morphological variations and the supporting statistical results clearly identified the two known bottlenose dolphin species: T. aduncus (Group-A) and T. truncatus (Group-B). This study confirms the presence of these two species of Tursiops in Pakistani waters. It adds new information useful for developing conservation action plans required for conservation of cetacean species in this region. © 2022 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The distribution of the long-beaked and short-beaked common dolphin morphs in the eastern South Pacific is not well defined. The objective of this study was to propose a potential distribution of the two forms along the coast of Peru and part of Chile based on the rostral index obtained from the ratio of rostral length and zygomatic width. This phenotypic criterion was implemented in skulls deposited in museum collections in Peru and Chile. Based on classification, we were able to determine the distribution of each morphotype considering the collection location. A total of 44 skulls were analyzed, three of which did not have collection location. The results show that both forms of the common dolphins were distributed along the coast of Peru, but only the short-beaked common dolphin occurred in Chile. A larger number of short-beaked specimens were detected, especially in northern Peru. It was remarkable that the long-beaked was less common than expected since it is usually sighted in neritic waters. Around the 13° S latitude degrees seems to be an overlapping area with specimens of the two forms. Our study provides an analysis of the distribution of the two forms of common dolphins by implementing a discrimination index developed for North Pacific populations. Some patterns of segregation were observed, but this should be contrasted with a larger number of skulls and the application of other phenotypic criteria specific to the South Pacific. © SAREM, 2023.

ABSTRACT: Staphylococcus are widespread bacteria that cause superficial and invasive infections in sev-eral species. The species Staphylococcus delphini is a Gram-positive bacterium belonging to the Staphylococcus intermedius group, being a mucosa colonizer and an opportunistic pathogen in some animals, including delphinids (Canver et al., 2019; Vrbovská et al., 2020). The first isolation was from two aquarium dolphins suffering from multifocal purulent skin lesions (Varaldo et al., 1988). S. del-phini has subsequently been isolated from other mammals (e.g., cows, horses, donkeys, camels, mustelids) and avian species (e.g., Adélie pen-guins, pigeons, cinereous vultures, red kites, ducks) (Sasaki et al., 2007; Guardabassi et al., 2012; Mama et al., 2019; Ruiz-Ripa et al., 2019; Vrbovská et al., 2020). Recently, the zoonotic potential of S. del-phini has been recognized (Magleby et al., 2019). Herein, we present the diagnosis and successful treatment of S. delphini-caused cutaneous lesions on a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops trunca-tus) under human care. © 2023,International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Understanding the characteristics of hotspots of species distribution provides opportunities for habitat-based management; a vital and often missing component in the conservation of mobile marine species. Correlates of species distribution derived from species distribution models (SDMs) are assumed to represent the characteristics of important habitat, which often include physical and biological (i.e., prey) components. In this study, we integrate surveys of Hector’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) with in-situ data on environmental characteristics and prey to identify the statistical correlates of distribution and to assess ‘what makes hotspots unique’. Methods: Between 2014 and 2017, ca. 300 surveys were carried out at hotspots and areas not routinely used by dolphins at Banks Peninsula on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island. A broad range of prey and environmental variables were explored as drivers of dolphin distribution using generalized additive models, and principal component analysis was employed to determine a key environmental signature for hotspots. Results: The relative abundance of dolphins was strongly correlated with prey abundance and a range of environmental variables representing habitat type and oceanographic conditions. The combination of high prey abundance and sandy, shallow, high current and low turbidity habitat was strongly represented at hotspots. Discussion: These characteristics are also likely attributes of habitat with high ecological value generally, being related to high biodiversity, productivity, naturalness and ecosystem function. This study showcases the importance of targeted investigations into the characteristics of species hotspots to better guide the management of important areas for the conservation of both species and ecosystems.

ABSTRACT: This study is the first to assess the occurrence of micro-litter ingested by marine megafauna in the north-eastern Aegean Sea. A total of 25 specimens from four species of marine mammals, including dolphins and monk seals, and two species of sea turtles, found stranded along the coastline of Samos Island, Greece, were selected for the analysis. Litter particles, identified as microplastics (MPs), were ubiquitous throughout all sections of the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach and intestine) in all specimens. Overall, the MPs most frequently found were black fibres 0.21–0.50 mm in size. These results provide insight into the extent of micro-litter ingestion and contamination in marine vertebrates. Here we propose a method of standardisation to establish a baseline for marine taxa in this region of the Mediterranean Sea, where knowledge of the topic is still lacking. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The lunar cycle's influence over marine species has recently come under the scope of research. Many studies on organisms at each stage of the trophic levels have been recorded, however, research regarding the lunar cycle's influence on megafauna within the Adriatic is limited. With a large amount of research investigating the tidal influence on marine life, peer-reviewed research regarding the irradiance of the moon is lacking. We hypothesized that there would be an increase in surface feeding behaviors when plankton and prey have migrated to a more accessible area in the water column with the diel vertical migration, thus attracting tertiary consumers. To investigate the influence of the lunar cycle and the Montenegrin bottlenose dolphin populations, 514 morning surveys were conducted between 2016-2023, with a total of 273 focal groups. Neither surface-feeding behavior nor dolphin presence was found to be associated with the moon phases nor illumination. Spearman's rank correlation also showed no significant relationship between illumination and surface-feeding percentage. Although no significant relationship was found, surface-feeding behavior was most common during periods of reduced illumination. The findings of this study contradict many studies globally, as the lunar cycle has been seen to influence delphinid species around the world. Perhaps the results could be affected by the oceanic conditions within the Mediterranean, more specifically Montenegro's neritic waters, due to the shallow bathymetry and low tidal range. Further research looking into the differences between the inside of the bay of Boka Kotorska and the coastal waters would be of interest.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Background The eastern waters of Taiwan have been lacking baseline and research data for several years. This study was initiated by Kuroshio Ocean Education Foundation (KOEF) in collaboration with the Turumoan whale-watching company since 1998, collecting long-term ecological data for cetaceans in the inshore of Hualien, eastern Taiwan. This dataset includes 10,675 records of cetacean sightings from June 1998 to December 2021. Collection of cetacean sighting records was paused for one year in 2001 due to budgetary reasons. All of the sighting records were collected by whale-watching boat guides that were trained by KOEF. Following a standardised protocol, guides used a handheld GPS device and cetacean sighting record sheets to document information about the cetacean species identification, location, time, number of individuals, the presence of mother-calf pairs and mixed-species groups and other states of each sighting during a whale-watching tour. The collection of citizen-science data during this period has significantly advanced Taiwan's cetacean baseline data in the study area. Additionally, we make data available to the public in the form of citizen-science, making a substantial contribution to the advancement of ocean scientific research. We have published the dataset on Global Biodiversity Information Facility, allowing users around the world to download the dataset. New information This is currently the largest dataset of cetacean sighting records in Taiwan (last updated on 2023-09-05). We have also recorded several species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List categorised as "Data Deficient" during our survey inshore of Hualien, eastern Taiwan, including Ginkgo-toothed beaked whales (Mesoplodon ginkgodens Nishiwaki & Kamiya, 1958), Omura's whales ( Balaenoptera omurai Wada, Oishi & Yamada, 2003) and killer whales (Orcinus orca (Linnaeus, 1758)). There are also sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus Linnaeus, 1758), categorised as "Vulnerable" in the IUCN Red List and false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens (Owen, 1846)), categorised as "Near Threatened". This study is also the first and only long-term study that has documented cetaceans in the study area. © Hu C et al.

ABSTRACT: Sympatric organisms can avoid competition by occupying different ecological niches, a mechanism known as niche partitioning. In Iceland, white-beaked dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris and harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena are the most common small cetaceans observed but their trophic ecology remains understudied, including the potential for resource competition. In this study, we measured δ15N and δ13C values from white-beaked dolphin (n = 28) and harbour porpoise (n = 29) muscle samples collected over a 33 yr period (1987−2019) to compare isotopic niche width and overlap of both species, as well as diet composition. We also tested for within-species effects of sex, age class, body length, year of sampling and origin (bycatch vs. stranding) on the δ13C and δ15N values. Intra-species variations included differences between stranded and bycaught white-beaked dolphins and ontogenetic variations in both species, but further studies are necessary to investigate the factors that might explain these results. Inter-species comparisons showed that harbour porpoises and white-beaked dolphins had non-overlapping isotopic niches, with harbour porpoises exhibiting smaller niche widths (corrected standard ellipse area, SEAc: 1.25 vs. 2.13%2). While white-beaked dolphins had a broader diet, composed primarily of gadoids but with contributions of other fish species, harbour porpoises fed almost exclusively on capelin Mallotus villosus, suggesting niche segregation and width is largely maintained by targeting different prey resources. Both species also showed no long-term changes in trophic ecology, despite recent ecosystem changes in this region, possibly a result of adapting to spatial changes in prey distribution or shifts to other prey at similar trophic levels. © Inter-Research 2022.

ABSTRACT: A complete postmortem examination, including a computed tomography scan “virtopsy” (virtual necropsy), gross necropsy, cytology, histology, and molecular diagnostics were performed to investigate the cause of death of a deceased adult male Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) that stranded on Pensacola Beach, Florida, USA in February 2020. Significant findings included chronic inflammation of the meninges, brain, and spinal cord with intralesional protozoa (identified as Sarcocystis speeri via 18S rRNA and ITS-1 sequences), suppurative fungal tracheitis and bronchopneumonia (identified as Aspergillus fumigatus via ITS-2 gene sequence) and ulcerative bacterial glossitis (associated with a novel Treponema species, Candidatus Treponema stenella, identified via 23S rRNA gene sequence). This is the first reported case of S. speeri in a marine mammal. Little is understood about the epidemiology of S. speeri, including the identity of its intermediate hosts. The findings of this case suggest that S. frontalis may be a capable aberrant host and experience morbidity and mortality from this parasite. It is suspected that the novel Treponema and Aspergillus fumigatus infections were opportunistic or secondary to immunosuppression, either due to S. speeri infection or other co-morbidities.

ABSTRACT: Underwater noise pollution from the world’s longest cross-sea bridge—the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB)—which stretches across the Chinese White Dolphin National Nature Reserve (of the People’s Republic of China, PRC) in the Pearl River Estuary may affect the distribution of local humpback dolphins. In this study, static passive acoustic monitoring was applied to monitor biosonar activity of humpback dolphins and underwater noise adjacent to the tunnel section of the HZMB for more than one year. During the monitoring period, dolphin biosonar signals were detected on 88.5% of days. A significant temporal pattern occurred in dolphin biosonar activity and in anthropogenic noise. Biosonar activity was significantly higher at night than during the day, whereas underwater noise occurred more in the day than at night. Significantly more echolocation signals were detected in winter-spring than in summer-autumn, and highest acoustic activity occurred significantly more during high tide than at other tidal periods. In addition, the negative correlation between elevated underwater noise and dolphin sonar activity in winter suggests that dolphins may avoid noisy waters for short periods, perhaps due to auditory stress, but fish prey movement cannot be ruled out. These findings facilitate understanding activity patterns of humpback dolphins in the Pearl River Estuary and may contribute to conservation efforts.

ABSTRACT: Odontocetes, or 'toothed whales', have a complex brain structure and possess rationality, self-awareness, sociability and culture. Cognitive science and modern theories of personhood challenge the notion that humans alone are moral persons. This paper reviews evidence from the cognitive science literature relevant to moral personhood in bottlenose dolphins, orcas, and beluga whales. It applies theories of personhood of Peter Singer, David DeGrazia, and Steven Wise, and finds that odontocetes fulfil criteria to be granted at least borderline personhood. The legal implications of attributing personhood to dolphins remains uncertain. Recognition of dolphin personhood may lead to fundamental legal rights against capture, captivity, and killing; alternatively, the courts may continue to restrict legal personhood and associated protections to human beings. Finally, despite the major influence of personhood on morality and law in the West, the biologically more widespread quality of sentience is sufficient for greater moral considerability and legal protections for nonhuman species. © 2023 Copyright 2023 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin whistle detection is an important and multipurpose but time-consuming task. The ability to automate and streamline this process can be invaluable for future research in marine studies and other fields that aim to utilise these signals. When dealing with underwater acoustics, a large obstacle to overcome is the abundance of noise and interfering sounds, natural and anthropogenic alike. In this paper, we apply successful image classification networks to two separate datasets containing dolphin whistles with the goal of determining an effective method to conduct automated detection with minimal interference from a manual operator regardless of environment. We further investigate the impacts of shrinking the dataset size and performing parameter freezing on the networks at hand. Networks are assessed by their detection accuracy and achieve performances comparable to those in existing works, the best being 96.7%, thus proving the effectiveness of these pre-trained image classification models. © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins, like all mammals, depend on the respiratory system to bring oxygen into the body and remove the carbon dioxide produced by aerobic metabolism. In marine mammals, such as dolphins, that divide their time at the surface exchanging gases through the lungs and spending considerable time underwater holding their breath, the lungs have specialized adaptations. For example, the hydrostatic pressure of water increases with depth, causing compression of air-filled spaces resulting in lung compression and eventually alveolar collapse. This process affects the function of the respiratory system and gas exchange during diving. In addition, dolphins need to complete a respiratory cycle during the short period in the air when porpoising, which has resulted in fast and high respiratory flow rates. Thus, life in the ocean has resulted in several adaptations to obtain sufficient oxygen to perform dives. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Overfishing and climate change have combined to cause fishery stocks to decline and fish community composition to change, further threatening the predation and nutritional health of marine mammals. Methods: In this study, we collected potential prey fishes catched by fishermen in six habitats of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and analyzed their proximate composition (moisture, water, fat and protein), the fatty acid composition and the amino acid composition to evaluate the possible health effect on humpback dolphins. Results: The results showed that the nutritional composition varied significantly with species and locations. Fishes in the families Sciaenidae and Engraulidae displayed richer fatty acid composition, while those in the family Clupeidae had the highest value of amino acid quality index. In Zhuhai, home to the largest Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin population, pelagic/neritic prey fishes possessed lower energy density, PUFA content, PUFA/SFA ratio, DHA content, and EAA content compared to demersal fish, suggesting nutritional stress when there is a dietary switch from demersal to pelagic/neritic fishes in Zhuhai population. Discussion: Our study provided a framework, with energy density and fatty acid composition as its most important indicator, for assessment of the marine top predators based on the nutritional composition of their prey fishes and revealed the potential threats. Data here is expected to facilitate the development of scientific programs for successful conservation of not only the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, but also other marine top predators, possibly through reconstructing their prey fish’s quantity and quality.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to study the habitat preferences and daylight behaviour of the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) and the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) off the west coast of Penang Island, Malaysia. Between February 2019 and April 2021, 87 boat-based surveys were undertaken using predetermined survey routes. Species occurrence, behaviour, and habitat use were recorded. Irrawaddy dolphins (n = 52 sightings) were recorded with a mean group size of 3.6 (SE = 0.4) and finless porpoises (n = 35 sightings) with a mean group size of 2.5 (SE = 0.2). Both species were found between 0.4 km and 7.9 km from the shore. Encounter rate for Irrawaddy dolphins was 0.19 sightings per effort hour and 1.4 sightings per 100 km while for finless porpoises it was 0.13 sightings per effort hour and 0.9 sightings per 100 km. A higher coefficient of area use (AU> 1.5%) for Irrawaddy dolphins occurred at the estuarine areas off Sungai [=River] Pinang and Sungai Burung while higher coefficient of area use for finless porpoises was seen near Teluk [=Bay] Kampi and Sungai Pinang. In terms of activity budget, milling behaviour was the most recorded behaviour for both Irrawaddy dolphin and finless porpoise at 36.4% and 51.6% respectively. Resting behaviour for both the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise was recorded for the first time off west Penang. The information obtained for habitat use and behaviour would contribute towards better management of Penang marine areas and conservation strategies for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise. © National University of Singapore.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans, like other mammals, maintain energy balance for growth and reproduction through the regulation of metabolic processes. Energy obtained from the catabolism of food supports these processes, which in dolphins and whales can range sevenfold from rest to maximum exertion. In this chapter, we focus on the energetic costs of dolphins, discussing their metabolic versatility. On the low end of their metabolic range, dolphins maintain an elevated resting metabolic rate (RMR) characteristic of most marine mammals. At the opposite end are the high metabolic costs of swimming and diving that are dictated by speed, hydrodynamics, gliding, and stroking mechanics. Here, we provide allometric comparisons for RMR, swimming metabolism, cost of transport, and field metabolic rate (FMR) for cetaceans ranging in size from 30kg harbor porpoises to 5000kg killer whales. Importantly, these mass-specific relationships for dolphins and whales can be used to estimate the potential effects of environmental change and anthropogenic disturbances on energetics, performance, and ultimately the fitness of individuals and populations. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Trauma from stingray spines (caudal barbs) has been intermittently documented as a cause of mild to fatal illness in odontocetes, particularly bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), as well as in pinnipeds, sirenians, the loggerhead sea turtle, great white shark, and cobia. Although stingray spines have been noted to cause serious injury to various organ systems, their potential involvement in cetacean reproductive tract pathology has not been previously described. In North America, published descriptions of wild cetacean strandings associated with stingray spines have all involved bottlenose dolphins in the southeastern United States, plus a bottlenose dolphin and a common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) in Mexico. In 2018, uterine rupture was observed in a gravid bottlenose dolphin found deceased in Florida with stingray spine penetration into the abdominal cavity. Gross necropsy and histopathology findings were compatible with the stingray spine being involved with the rupture. To provide fuller insight into the case, a scientific literature review was conducted, and results of an unpublished 1998 necropsy involving a coastal female bottlenose dolphin that stranded in the northeastern state of Massachusetts with stingray spine presence was reviewed. Additionally, a query of the nationwide U.S. marine mammal stranding database was conducted for stingray spine-associated cetacean strandings from 1995 to 2019. Of 61 cetacean strandings revealed in the query to involve stingray spine presence, 59 were bottlenose dolphins from the southeastern U.S. states, plus Puerto Rico and Virginia; a bottlenose dolphin in southern California and a short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) were also noted. Query results did not support a bottlenose dolphin sex predilection for stingray spine-associated strandings; most such strandings involved adults. Behavioral, environmental, anthropogenic, and climatic events may influence marine mammal–stingray interactions. Continued vigilance for stingray spine-associated pathologic changes is warranted during marine mammal stranding investigations at diverse geographic sites. © (2023), (Western Illinois University).

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were analyzed in 136 blubber samples of Franciscana dolphins from Brazil (Pontoporia blainvillei), which is the most threatened dolphin in the Southwestern Atlantic. The dolphins were caught by the fishery fleet and collected from 2000 to 2018 in three regions of São Paulo state: northern São Paulo (SPN), central São Paulo (SPC), and southern São Paulo (SPS). The POPs analyzed in this study were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), Mirex, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), chlordane compounds (CHLs), hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The concentrations ranged from 36 to 7200 ng g−1 lipid weight (lw) and 113–42200 ng g−1 lw for predominant compounds DDTs and PCBs, respectively. Similar profiles of PCB congeners were observed with a predominance of hexachlorinated compounds, representing approximately 50% of the total PCB amount; the highest PCB concentrations were observed from Baixada Santista (SPC) proximate to a highly urbanized and industrial coastal area. Significant differences were observed between the sexes and maturity of dolphins, mainly for PCBs, DDTs, and Mirex. In general, POPs other than HCB in Franciscana dolphins showed downward temporal trends, matching the regulatory periods for restricting and/or banning these compounds. Although POP concentrations are declining, PCB levels remain high in small dolphins, suggesting adverse health effects on Franciscanas. As organic contaminants are one of the numerous threats Franciscanas have been vulnerable to along the Brazilian coast, we recommend monitoring POPs levels every five years to check for declining (or stabilizing) trends. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are mobile apex marine predators. Over the past three decades, warm-water adapted dolphin species (short-beaked common and striped) have expanded their ranges northward and become increasingly abundant in British waters. Meanwhile, cold-water adapted dolphins (white-beaked and Atlantic white-sided) abundance trends are decreasing, with evidence of the distribution of white-beaked dolphins shifting from southern to northern British waters. These trends are particularly evident in Scottish waters and ocean warming may be a contributing factor. This mobility increases the likelihood of interspecific dietary overlap for prey among dolphin species previously separated by latitude and thermal gradients. Foraging success is critical to both individual animal health and overall population resilience. However, the degree of dietary overlap and plasticity among these species in the Northeast Atlantic is unknown. Here, we characterise recent (2015-2021) interspecific isotopic niche and niche overlap among six small and medium-sized delphinid species co-occurring in Scottish waters, using skin stable isotope composition (δ13C and δ15N), combined with stomach content records and prey δ13C and δ15N compiled from the literature. Cold-water adapted white-beaked dolphin have a smaller core isotopic niche and lower dietary plasticity than the generalist short-beaked common dolphin. Striped dolphin isotopic niche displayed no interspecific overlap, however short-beaked common dolphin isotopic niche overlapped with white-beaked dolphin by 30% and Atlantic white-sided dolphin by 7%. Increasing abundance of short-beaked common dolphin in British waters could create competition for cold-water adapted dolphin species as a significant portion of their diets comprise the same size Gadiformes and high energy density pelagic schooling fish. These priority prey species are also a valuable component of the local and global fishing industry. Competition for prey from both ecological and anthropogenic sources should be considered when assessing cumulative stressors acting on cold-water adapted dolphin populations with projected decline in available habitat as ocean temperatures continue to rise.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans can be considered good natural samplers of biodiversity due to the different hunting strategies they adopt. In this study, the stomach contents of 28 Tursiops truncatus (15 females and 13 males), stranded along Tuscany coasts, NW Mediterranean, between 2008 and 2021, were analyzed. The prey items were identified at the lowest taxonomic level possible, and assessed in terms of abundance, weight, and frequency of occurrence. The index of relative importance (IRI) was also computed. Overall, 2201 bony fishes and 406 cephalopods were identified. The trophic spectrum resulted in high diversity (69 taxa) and the prey species, 53 fishes and 16 cephalopods, live at different levels of the water column. Predation was mainly based on European hake, Merluccius merluccius (%IRI 26.9), and conger eel, Conger conger (%IRI 25.1). The abundant presence of nocturnal species, such as Conger and Ophidion, indicates the nocturnal hunting activity of the bottlenose dolphin. Furthermore, evidence is presented of the dolphins’ ability to capture fish at night, taking advantage of the sound produced by these fish to locate them. Diet did not show any statistical differences among sexes, except that females preyed upon a significantly higher quantity of octopods than males. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Numerous studies have focused on the scavenger communities that feed on the carcasses of large marine animals, such as whales, in deep-sea habitats. Yet, there are far fewer studies in shallow water ecosystems and especially in the Mediterranean. Here, we performed an artificial cetacean fall in shallow waters in the northwestern Mediterranean. The cetacean carcass was monitored by via 30-min time-lapse photos using a fixed camera. We observed that bony fish were the main scavenger taxa. In addition, different species arrived at different times perhaps reflecting their role as scavengers or active predators. © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The taxonomy of the South American river dolphins of the genus Inia has been a focus of intense debate. While traditionally it is thought to be composed of a single species with three geographically structured subspecies (Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis, I. g. humboldtiana, and I. g. boliviensis), recent molecular studies have highlighted substantial differentiation, suggesting the existence of two species (I. geoffrensis and I. araguaiaensis). Despite this evidence, the recognition of the specific status of these taxa has been hindered by inconsistent morphological diagnoses. Here, we aim to provide evidence for the morphological differentiation (or lack thereof) between subspecies and putative species. We employ geometrics and traditional morphometrics to measure skull variation to support efforts of integrative taxonomy. Our results show that morphometric diversity within the group is inconsistent with a single taxon. Morphometric evidence supports the traditional differentiation of three distinct morphotypes within the analyzed sample. These morphotypes largely correspond to described subspecies I. g. geoffrensis, I. g. humboldtiana - the latter differing from the former by size - and I. g. boliviensis, which differs from the remaining groups by shape. Furthermore, morphometric data show no differences between I. g. geoffrensis and a newly proposed species, I. araguaiaensis. Given the conservation importance of this genus and the different threats they are subject to, we strongly suggest an urgent integrative taxonomic treatment of the group to better protect these singular cetaceans. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The LNG terminals are characterized by a large number of ships entering the port during the winter season due to the seasonality of rapidly increasing demand for heating. In winter, there is a shortage of dolphin jetty wharf (dolphins), which increases the waiting rate for ships. Therefore, there is a practical argument that dolphins should be additionally built to solve the ship standby problem. This study proposes the proper LNG handling capacity of a terminal with multiple dolphins of different size. Studies on calculating the LNG handling capacity of LNG terminal dolphins have been proposed by UNCTAD and Ministry of Transport of China (MTC). The formula-based calculation of LNG handling capacity has the advantage of being simple, but it has the disadvantage of not reflecting the actual operation. In this study, the proper LNG handling capacity is measured using a simulation method to overcome the limitations of formula-based calculation for Incheon port in South Korea. In order to check whether the method by simulation is justified, it is compared with the unloading capacity by the calculation formula. This study finds that the proper (or optimal) LNG handling capacity of Incheon port is determined by a dolphin occupancy of 49%, where the dolphin’s profits are maximized. As the results of simulation model, the proper (or optimal) loading capacity is 38.5 million m3 when dolphin occupancy is 49%. The capacity of individual dolphin is estimated at 17.0 million m3 for 70,000 DWT dolphin and 21.2 million m3 for 120,000 DWT dolphin, respectively. The main points of this study to use simulation model are as follows: First, the number of non-working days should be considered. Second, the optimal dolphin occupancy should be determined by finding the maximum profit point of using the pier. Third, if the size of the dolphin is different, an appropriate simulation will be implemented. Fourth, the data of the peak season should be analyzed. Finally, it should be checked whether the ship waiting rate is acceptable level or not. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Human-wildlife interactions have been shown to positively impact tourist beliefs and actions in relation to wildlife and the environment. The purpose of this study was to explore guest beliefs and perceptions about dolphins and dolphin programs before and after participating in human-dolphin interactions (HDI). We surveyed 142 guests participating in a self-selected HDI located in a natural lagoon facility at The Roatán Institute for Marine Sciences in Sandy Bay Roatán, Honduras. Of the 142 survey respondents, 130 completed the survey fully, and 28 of those 130 also completed a two-week follow-up survey. The results indicated that the guests maintained pre-existing positive attitudes towards dolphins, learned new information, and reported feeling connected with nature following their HDI experiences. The HDI experience format resulted in few differences in participant responses, suggesting that interactive programs maintained existing attitudes while subtly shaping beliefs about human-animal interactions.  © 2023 Heather M.

ABSTRACT: The California coastal stock of bottlenose dol-phins (Tursiops truncatus) expanded its range north from the Southern California Bight, its historical range, into Central California coinci-dent with the 1982-1983 El Niño event. Since the late 1980s, bottlenose dolphin sightings north of Central California have been increasingly reported. To determine the present-day northern range limit for these dolphins, photo-identifica-tion efforts were carried out from 2007 to 2018 in San Francisco Bay and nearby coastal waters during which 84 individuals were identified. The results demonstrate a significant range expan-sion along the Northern California coast at least as far as Sonoma County (38.7º N). Comparisons with photo-identification catalogs compiled south of San Francisco from 1981 to 2015 revealed that 92% of the 84 dolphins were matched to Monterey Bay (n = 77), Santa Barbara (n = 27), Santa Monica Bay (n = 29), Orange County (n = 9), Corona Del Mar (n = 2), San Diego (n = 31), and Ensenada, Mexico (n = 1). Many of the 84 dolphins (54%) showed long-range movements across the stock’s range between the Southern California Bight and the San Francisco Bay Area. The greatest movement distance recorded was by two individuals first observed in San Diego, California, in the 1980s and subsequently in Puget Sound, Washington (47º N), in 2017, setting a coastal bottlenose dolphin long-distance move-ment record of at least 2,500 km. © 2023, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins are the most common cetacean kept globally in zoos and aquaria (hereafter zoos), and are gregarious animals with a mostly opportunistic, generalist feeding strategy in the wild. In zoos, they have limited to no opportunities to express natural foraging behaviours as they receive their daily food ration of dead fish in a series of training sessions. Enrichment provision has increased in recent years, but items are still predominantly simple and floating in nature, and do not always target the animals’ problem-solving or food-acquisition behaviours. These discrepancies run concurrently with the intense debate about dolphin welfare in zoos and how to improve it. The current study used a within-subject design on 11 bottlenose dolphins at Kolmårdens Djurpark and measured how several welfare indicators differed between two treatments of “cognitive” and “non-cognitive” food-based enrichment. The treatments were provided on an alternating basis for eight consecutive weeks: during cognitive enrichment weeks, the animals received items which stimulated their problem-solving and foraging behaviours, and during non-cognitive enrichment weeks, they received simple items paired with fish (to eliminate bias due to food value). Data were taken related to several multidisciplinary welfare parameters during enrichment provision and training sessions, and to activity budget behaviours throughout the week. During the cognitive as opposed to non-cognitive enrichment weeks, the dolphins engaged more with the enrichment, were more motivated to participate in training sessions and performed less anticipatory and stereotypic behaviours, suggesting that cognitive enrichment improved several indicators of bottlenose dolphin welfare. Valuable lines of further investigation would be to understand how individual differences and different types of cognitive enrichment impact potential welfare benefits. Our results suggest that enrichment items promoting cognitive foraging behaviours may improve dolphin welfare, and therefore zoos might prioritise giving cognitive enrichment to this species as well as considering the same for other species with similar cognitive skills and foraging ecologies. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Individually distinctive signature whistles are used by common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) during social interactions and to facilitate group cohesion. There is evidence from a few populations that Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins (T. aduncus) also use signature whistles. We investigated this from a coastal resident population of T. aduncus in Mozambique. Video-audio data were collected during recreational swim-with activities over 12 years, where potential signature whistles were identified from 28 individuals. Of the 405 whistles documented, 75% were produced in SIGID bouts. Visual assessment of individual signature whistle contours demonstrated temporal stability for up to 8 years. Overall, most signature whistle types had upsweep frequency modulation and were emitted as multiloop whistles. Comparing all whistle contours to each other indicated low discrimination between individuals, with contours frequently categorised together. However, sex differences in the frequency characteristics of whistles were identified, with females whistling at lower frequencies than males. Our results indicate either a shared whistle repertoire or identity encoding with subtle contour features, requiring acute auditory perception and discrimination to decipher caller identity. More widespread geographic investigation into signature whistle use may demonstrate variation in acoustic communication systems for bottlenose dolphins, which are thus far not well understood. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a highly infectious virus of whales, dolphins, and porpoises and is one of the major viral pathogens of cetaceans. It can infect a wide range of cetacean species and has caused mass mortalities in several parts of the world in the past 30 years. The virus causes immunosuppression that often results in secondary viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (including Toxoplasma gondii) in an infected animal. On 10 January 2019 a Risso’s dolphin stranded in Morong, Bataan, Philippines with recurring diarrhea. The dolphin succumbed three months later while in rehabilitation. Methodology: Necropsy, histopathology, serology, and PCR were carried out to determine the cause of death and other clinical signs. Results: Gross necropsy showed that the animal died due to intestinal volvulus. Serology revealed CeMV antibody titers at ≥1:512 via CeMV virus neutralization, as well as IgG antibody against T. gondii. No CeMV RNA was detected. Conclusion: To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first documented case of CeMV infection in a cetacean from the Philippines. The absence of reports of mass mortalities that can be attributed to CeMV in the Philippines suggests that the virus is likely endemic in the region. © 2023, University of the Philippines at Los Banos.

ABSTRACT: Waters around oceanic islands are often consid-ered marine biodiversity hotspots. Their high productivity and complex bathymetry provide refuge, food sources, and nurseries for many spe-cies (Clark et al., 2010; Friedlander et al., 2019). Despite their ecological importance, oceanic islands are often overlooked in area-based pro-tection planning because they are considered pre-served due to their remoteness. However, factors such as illegal fishing and increasing ecotourism with close proximity to marine megafauna make it urgent to document information about key species that inhabit these waters (Aburto-Oropeza et al., 2017; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2020). © 2023,International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

ABSTRACT: The most researched acoustic system belongs to bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), however despite their wide, sophisticated, and plastic acoustic repertoire, there is still much that is unknown about them. This study intends to compare the whistle features of dolphins in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea of Turkey and the Adriatic Sea (in the coastal waters of Montenegro). The information regarding the acoustic characteristics of cetaceans in the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea is still limited, and our preliminary study will add to that knowledge. For the analysis a total of 202 whistles from Montenegro and a total of 682 whistles from Turkey were used. A significant difference between whistle type between the two countries was found. According to a PCA test, the variables Inflection points and High frequency explained more than 80% of the variation in the data for Montenegro, for Turkey this variation was explained by the Center frequency and Delta frequency. A Rank-Manova showed significant differences on PC1 and PC2. In comparison to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea of Turkey, the coastal regions of Montenegro had a lower average for each whistle parameter, with the exception of the number of inflection points. This difference can be explained by the geographic isolation between the two regions. Efficient conservation management plans can be created by gaining a better understanding of delphinid bioacoustics, including their traits and variations in different geographic locations and under various anthropogenic pressures.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Amazonian river dolphin (pink dolphins) Inia geoffrensis are an endangered species whose environmental surrounding in the heart of the Amazonian rainforest is constantly in danger. To explore the abundance and abundance response of these this species, we set up a plan for the monitoring of this amazing species by means of long term passive acoustic recorders placed at multiple locations in the pink dolphins' habitat. In this paper, we outline the first step of this monitoring program: the characteristics of the pink dolphins' sounds, and the design of an automatic detector for their vocalization. Results are given for a small set of recordings obtained manually in multiple surveys performed in the Tipotini river set out in the Ecuadorian Amazonian region. © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is an intermittent breather, where the breath begins with an exhalation followed by inhalation and an extended inter-breath interval ranging from 10 to 40 s. Breathing has been shown to alter both the instantaneous heart rate (ifH) and stroke volume (iSV) in the bottlenose dolphin, with a transitory ventilatory tachycardia following the breath, and an exponential decrease to a stable ifH around 40 beats • min−1 during the inter-breath period. As the total breath duration in the dolphin is around 1 s, it is not possible to assess the contribution of exhalation and inhalation to these changes in cardiac function during normal breathing. Methods: In the current study, we evaluated the ifH response by separating expiration and inspiration of a breath, which allowed us to distinguish their respective contribution to the changes in ifH. We studied 3 individual male bottlenose dolphins trained to hold their breath between the different respiratory phases (expiration and inhalation). Results: Our data show that inspiration causes an increase in ifH, while expiration appears to result in a decrease in ifH. Discussion: These data provide improved understanding of the cardiorespiratory coupling in dolphins, and show how both exhalation and inhalation alters ifH.

ABSTRACT: A classic issue in ecology is to understand how similar species coexist in a given area (i.e., sympatry). The situation of dolphins in the Western Mediterranean Sea may represent a special case of sympatry in that three similar species (the short-beaked common dolphin [Delphinus delphis], the striped dolphin [Stenella coeruleoalba], and the bottlenose dolphin [Tursiops truncatus) are under strong human impacts in the same area. From the viewpoint of ecology and conservation biology, it is challenging to determine how these three dolphin species live together and avoid competitive exclusion in the setting of such impacts. The Spanish Institute of Oceanography has a dataset of dolphin species opportunistic sightings. Using these data, we constructed three binary variables, comprising the sighting of one species versus the sighting of either of the other two species. We obtained three significant probability models after performing logistic regression of these binary variables on a set of spatio-temporal explanatory variables. We analysed these models from the perspective of fuzzy set theory by applying the favourability function to the probability models, fuzzy operations overlap, and entropy. The results show that common dolphins are differentially favoured in the eastern part of the study area and far away from main shipping routes. The striped dolphin was differentially favoured in the western part of the study area, above deep waters, near main shipping routes, and in summer and spring. Finally, bottlenose dolphins were differentially favoured in the mid-western part of the study area, in winter, and over shallow waters. © 2023,Mediterranean Marine Science.All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Accurate diet identification of top predators is crucial to fully understand their ecological roles. Compared to terrestrial animals, gathering dietary information from cetaceans is notoriously difficult. Here, we applied a multilocus metabarcoding approach to investigate the diet of vulnerable Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Indo-Pacific finless porpoises from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. Our analyses identified 21 prey fish species from the 42 humpback dolphin stomachs, as well as 10 species of fish and 1 species of cephalopod from the 13 finless porpoise stomachs. All of the taxa were assigned to the species level, highlighting that the multimarker approach could facilitate species identification. Most of the prey species were small- and medium-sized fishes that primarily fed on zooplankton. The calculated similarity index revealed a moderated dietary overlap between the 2 cetaceans, presumably due to the feeding of the 2 predators in association with fishing vessels in the PRE. A more diverse diet was observed in humpback dolphins in the closed fishing season compared to the fishing season, implying the influence on the dolphin diet due to the availability of commercial fishery resources. However, according to the results of species rarefaction curves, our findings on the feeding habits of the 2 cetaceans are still limited by insufficient sample size and therefore should be interpreted with caution. This study represents a first attempt to apply the multilocus DNA metabarcoding technique in the diet analysis of small cetaceans, although more efforts are needed to improve this type of analysis. © 2022 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive biology was assessed in 106 female common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) examined post-mortem from stranding and bycatch events along the New Zealand coastline between 1997 and 2019. The average age (ASM) and length (LSM) at sexual maturity was estimated at 7.5 years and 183.5 cm, respectively. The total number of corpora in mature individuals increased with age and appeared to persist throughout life. Ovarian asymmetry was apparent, with the left ovary displaying higher rates of ovulation, and a maximum of 19 corpora recorded for a 24-year-old female. The estimated ovulation and annual pregnancy rates for mature females were 0.39 year−1 and 30%, respectively. Conception and calving occurred year-round, with a weak seasonal increase observed in late austral spring and early austral summer. As these data did not clearly show whether seasonality was present, the gestation, lactation, and resting periods were calculated as either 12.6 or 12.8 months based on the presence/absence of seasonality, respectively. Similarly, calving interval ranged from 3.15 to 3.2 years, depending upon whether seasonality was considered. The estimated LSM of the New Zealand population aligns with other populations globally, although the estimated ASM is younger by approximately 6 months. Other reproductive parameters align with Northern Hemisphere populations, although demonstrate variation, which may reflect adaptations to local conditions such as water temperature and prey availability. As the species is subject to anthropogenic impacts including pollution and bycatch, we suggest our findings be used as a baseline with which to monitor trends in population parameters. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Vessel collision induces blunt and sharp force traumas to aquatic animals and is a leading anthropogenic impact affecting cetaceans worldwide. Vessel collision is an important threat affecting vulnerable coastal cetaceans such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) which reside in coastal waters of Hong Kong amongst heavy marine traffic. Case presentation: A severely injured subadult S. chinensis was sighted in the waters off southwestern Hong Kong with four gaping incision wounds on its dorsum. It was in poor body condition and seemed unable to use the fluke effectively. The deepest wound located at the caudal peduncle near the base of the fluke and exposed the underlying fractured caudal vertebrae. The dolphin was monitored in the field over three weeks and eventually captured for medical intervention as veterinary assessment indicated progressive and life-threatening deterioration. During rehabilitation, the dolphin demonstrated initial signs of improvement over the first 36 hours as supported by diagnostic tests but then deteriorated rapidly. It was humanely euthanised after three days of rehabilitation. Postmortem investigation was carried out using virtopsy (postmortem computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and conventional necropsy, with special attention to the traumatic musculoskeletal injuries caused by vessel collision and also revealed acute gastrointestinal compromise and respiratory disease that further hampered the rehabilitation. Conclusion: In cetaceans, the prognosis for recovery from injuries caused by vessel collision depends on the extent, location, and gravity of the injuries (i.e., superficial, deep, penetrating, blunt vs. sharp, fresh vs. septic), as well as the health status of the individual and its ability to respond to the insult. Injuries extending deep into the vertebral column may lead to delayed death and associated welfare issues. The prognosis of this case was likely poor given the severity and location of the injuries, but the attempted rehabilitation and postmortem investigation provided valuable insights for clinical management if similar cases are encountered in the future. Being able to non-invasively assess and document traumatic injuries and other pathologies, diagnostic imaging is particularly useful in the clinical assessment and postmortem investigation (virtopsy) of cases with vessel-induced injuries. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: An understanding of animal grouping patterns is essential to increase knowledge about their social systems. We used a 5-year continuous dataset to investigate grouping behavior in a free-ranging highly social mammal, the bottlenose dolphin. Our objective was achieved by examining the relationships between a set of oceanographic, climatic, topographic, anthropogenic and social variables and bottlenose dolphin group size. Modeling analysis revealed that bottlenose dolphin group dynamics was linked to both small-scale oceanographic variation and large-scale climatic variation. Larger groups of bottlenose dolphins were predicted with an elevated concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water column, a moderate concentration of chlorophyll-a 60 days before each encounter, and a neutral NAO index. The observed link between environmental variables and dolphin group size is likely associated to changes in dolphin prey availability. Bottlenose dolphin group dynamics are likely driven by multiple factors, and social variables may act synergistically with environmental parameters. Larger groups of bottlenose dolphins were indeed also predicted with a greater number of dependent calves, likely because of enhanced care towards the calves. This study illustrates the value of using multiple variables at different scales to explore the factors that shape animal societies. The current study therefore contributes to the growing body of literature on how environmental change, occurring at different spatio-temporal scales, is indirectly related to the social behavior of a marine top predator. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The quantity and quality of individual social relationships is a fundamental feature of social structure for group-living species. In many species, individuals preferentially associate with close relatives, which can amplify social benefits through inclusive fitness. Reproductive variation, dispersal and other factors may nevertheless impact relative kin availability, especially for species with slow life histories. As such, variation in family size can affect the social integration of the individual. Here, we investigated the effects of family size on female sociality in a population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Australia. This population exhibits high fission–fusion dynamics, with females varying widely in gregariousness and both sexes remaining philopatric, providing females with both matrilineal and nonmatrilineal kin as potential associates. We used genetic relatedness data obtained from a large single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel and a spatially explicit null model to measure females' propensities to form affiliations with both related and unrelated individuals. We found that females had strong social preferences for matrilineal close (first, second and third degree) kin, but also significant preferences for nonmatrilineal close and more distant kin compared to unrelated individuals. Despite these preferences, we found only small effects of kin availability on individual social position. Stronger and more consistent effects were attributable to individual foraging ecology, although much of the variation remains unexplained. Overall, our models suggest that while female dolphins have strong kin preferences, their social connectivity is not determined by family size; rather, individual foraging strategies and high fission–fusion dynamics enable a diverse repertoire of social strategies to coexist within a population. © 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: In many long-lived mammalian species, association patterns between individuals have been found to influence sociality, behavioral traits, survival, and longevity. In common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), the early stages of development are of particular importance as associations experienced as dependent calves may influence future association patterns. While behavioral characteristics associated with the transition from a dependent calf state to an independent juvenile state have been documented, there are limited studies that examine associations between these time periods. This study aims to document association longevity for bottlenose dolphins as they transition from calves to juveniles and determine the extent to which kinship plays a role in the development of these associations. Using social network analysis, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), and a tiered association scale, we found 53.7% of associations were retained from the calf to the juvenile phase. GLMM results indicated that preferred associates (half-weight index [HWI] > 0.178) from the calf state were 3.6 times more likely to associate in the juvenile state (0.178 > HWI > 0) and 5.67 times more likely to be preferred associates in the juvenile state compared to nonpreferred calf associates. The majority of juveniles, 76.92%, maintained a low-moderate to moderate level association (0.089-0.54) with their mother, and a few retained their mother as their top associate. Kin were preferred associates in 46.15% of cases and found to be the top juvenile associate in 26.92% of cases. Identifying continuity in associations, particularly from the calving state to the juvenile state, is imperative as mammalian association patterns may influence community structure, disease transmission, reproductive success, and predict survival. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) live in coastal waters that have experienced considerable anthropogenic disturbances. Specifically, along the coasts of highly urbanized regions, available habitats have decreased in both space and scale. This study used Maxent software to simulate the distribution of suitable habitats for S. chinensis during the dry and wet seasons in Xiamen Bay. We also aimed to identify key environmental factors influencing habitat distribution, with the goal of using our results to analyze conservation gaps and propose adjustments. We found that during the dry season, S. chinensis were mainly distributed in the Western Harbor, Jiulong River Estuary, and the mouth of Tongan Bay. During the wet season, they were distributed in the south of Western Harbor, Jiulong River Estuary, and around the Wuyu and Dadeng-Xiaodeng Islands. Nekton density, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature, slope, and salinity are the primary factors affecting S. chinensis distribution in Xiamen Bay. To better protect the species, the existing Tongan Bay reserve should be expanded during dry seasons, and suitable habitats in the Jiulong River Estuary should be turned into a seasonal protected region. Similarly, during wet seasons, the original Western Harbor portion of the reserve should increase to include the Jiulong River Estuary, northwest of the Wuyu Islands and south of the Dadeng-Xiaodeng Islands. In addition to this dynamic seasonal management of reserve size, we also recommend developing multiple-use protected areas and establishing a joint protection mechanism between local governments. In conclusion, our model offers important guidance on improving conservation measures of S. chinensis in Xiamen Bay. © (2023), (European Association for Aquatic Mammals). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Group membership is a key attribute of animal societies and central to the study of social structure in several taxa. However, social structure analyses are sensitive to the way data are collected and associations defined. In this study, a time–space method was used to investigate the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus observed and photographed across 7 years in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece. Instead of adopting traditional group definitions, individuals were considered as being members of the same group if photographed within a specific time and space window. This approach can be applied post hoc across studies and can offer advantages under challenging sampling conditions (e.g. when dealing with groups spread over vast areas or when group membership is otherwise hard to assess). Dolphins were mostly found around coastal cage aquaculture facilities farming European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax and gilthead seabream Sparus aurata. Dolphins formed clusters largely or entirely composed of individuals of the same sex, suggestive of sex-based homophily. Habitat partitioning was not detected: there was substantial spatial overlap among dolphin clusters, with all individuals using a relatively small area in the northern portion of the Gulf, where most of the productive fish farms were located. Associations between females were stronger than those between males, and daughters tended to stay in the group of their mothers. Sex-based social clustering may allow females and calves to limit interactions with potentially aggressive males, while individuals of both sexes benefit from prey concentrated around fish farms. Adaptation to foraging around farms can result in trade-offs between the costs and benefits of nourishment and social interaction. This may have both positive or negative effects on the animals that should be considered in the context of ensuring their favourable conservation status. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The major increase in cetacean brain size happened in the middle Miocene, about 15 million years ago, and involved the modern oceanic dolphin lineage Delphinoidea. In this paper, we describe a new specimen of an archaic dolphin, aff. Prosqualodon davidis, from the Gee Greensand, near Oamaru, New Zealand. The specimen is from the early Miocene, approximately 23–19–18 Ma, and includes an incomplete cranium, endocast, teeth, and some postcranial elements. Comparison of the median sulcus among previously reported endocasts and brains of the Cetacea suggests that the cerebrum was expanded incipiently in the Odontoceti from the early Miocene in the Eurhinodelphinidae + Delphinoidea lineage. Conversely, the olfactory fossa has been reduced in Odontoceti, and completely lost in at least two clades (Delphinoidea and Platanista gangetica), because olfaction was most likely no longer an essential sense for animals spending their life in water. Reduction and loss of the olfactory fossa saved energy, which may be related to the expansion of the cerebrum and cortex in an Odontoceti lineage that led to modern oceanic dolphins. The early Miocene appears to have been a transitional period for archaic and modern-type odontocetes, which were possibly and partly separated by these differences. © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: The Charleston Harbor in South Carolina (SC)is a major port that experiences high levels of vessel traffic. Historical analyses of coastal bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, now Tursiops erebennus) sightings identified multiple core use areas in the harbor that overlap with these anthropogenic activities. Informed by these long-term spatial data, passive acoustic monitoring, visual surveys, and prey sampling were conducted from December 2017 to June 2019 to assess the relationships and multivariate interactions that may influence dolphin vocalization patterns. Vocalizations varied spatially and temporally, peaking in fall and winter months coinciding with decreases in water temperature and daylight hours, following patterns previously reported in other SC estuaries. Dolphin prey and total fish abundance decreased with water temperature, which may indicate that dolphins echolocate and whistle more frequently in the winter months when prey are scarce and sound-producing species are less soniferous. Dolphin sightings and vocalizations were highly correlated. Dolphin occurrence was highest in the areas surrounding the confluence of the Cooper and Wando Rivers, along the shipping channel, where vessel and sound-producing fish detections were greatest. When vessel noise occurred, dolphins increased their vocalizations, which suggests that this population may be modifying its acoustic repertoire in response to increased noise levels. Multivariate interactions indicate strong spatial and seasonal patterns in vocalization rates that may be associated with dolphin and prey abundance as well as noise-induced redundancy. © (2023), (Western Illinois University).

ABSTRACT: Recreational use of wild spaces is increasingly popular, resulting in a burgeoning tourism industry. Such activities can degrade the environment and disrupt the behaviour and natural function of organisms. A small population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) is resident in Dusky Sound, New Zealand, a fjord with increasing human use. Dolphins, as top predators, play an important role within ecosystems and are at risk of long-term negative consequences from behavioural changes when exposed to high levels of vessel activity. A better understanding of the distribution of the dolphins in Dusky Sound would provide a framework for developing management within the fjord. Here we describe where dolphins were most frequently found, based on >40,000 km of photo-ID survey effort conducted over 10 years. Kernel density estimation revealed two large core areas that remained consistent over the duration of this study. This information could be used to determine areas within Dusky Sound where human activities around dolphins could be managed to avoid anthropogenically driven detrimental impacts. We suggest the following: (1) establish dolphin protection zones, (2) create a marine mammal sanctuary, (3) extend marine reserve boundaries, and/or (4) lower catch limits for fish within the fjord boundaries. © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: River dolphins from the genus Inia are widely distributed in the Amazon, Orinoco and Tocantins River basins. Current knowledge on the dietary habits of these species is poor and based on stomach contents from stranded animals. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to evaluate the diet preferences and trophic niche of the boto (Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis) and the bufeo (I. g. boliviensis) in three rivers from the Amazon and Tocantins basins. Samples were obtained from skin biopsies taken from social animals near fish markets during a tagging program or from dart biopsies of wild individuals. Prey isotopic data were obtained from fish collected during the surveys, catches by local fishermen or published data. Contribution of prey to consumer diet was calculated through isotope mixing models and trophic niches were represented by the isotopic niche area. Piscivore prey was the main item in the diet of bufeos and botos from Tapajós and Tocantins River wild group, whereas botos from Tocantins market group showed differences in diet and a lower trophic position probably mediated by human feeding near markets. Isotopic niche area was greater for Tapajós botos than for Tocantins market group botos and bufeos, which can be an effect of the homogenization of the human-mediated diet and low samples sizes, in the case of the market group and bufeos, respectively. Results presented here, represent a first attempt toward a better understanding of the trophic ecology of this endemic and threatened species through stable isotope analysis. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: Suckerfish attached to dolphin species have been extensively reported worldwide, yet such association has been rarely seen in the tropical and shallow waters of South America. In Brazil, the Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis is distributed along almost the entire extent of the coast and only one case of association with suckerfish has been published. Here we report on a sharksucker Echeneis naucrates associated with a young Guiana dolphin on the north-eastern coast of Brazil. The juvenile dolphin with an attached sharksucker was observed on two occasions separated by a 47-day period; we hypothesize the occurrence of host attachment fidelity. The present report adds information to better discuss the ecological interactions between echeneids and dolphins, and expands the baseline information on cetacean species serving as host to suckerfish. © The Author(s), 2022.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphin photo-identification data were compiled from western Scotland to identify individuals and ultimately investigate population size, demographic parameters, spatio-temporal distribution, and movement patterns. Opportunistic citizen science photographs revealed what appeared to be an adult bottlenose × Risso’s dolphin hybrid along with an apparent second-generation hybrid or back-cross calf. Both had atypically short rostra and the dorsal fin of the adult was noticeably taller than is normal for bottlenose dolphins. Based on these characteristics, this case may represent a congenital rostral abnormality or the first intergeneric calf reported for this species combination, either in captivity or in the wild. The previously reported presence of several putative hybrids and mixed-species sightings in the area, in combination with the tall dorsal fin, provide support for the second possibility, i.e. intergeneric hybrids. Although rare, hybridization may have disproportionate conservation consequences, with population-level impacts in very small coastal populations of long-lived, slow-breeding animals. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Prey detection and subsequent capture is considered a major hypothesis to explain feeding associations between common dolphins and Australasian gannets. However, a current lack of insight on nutritional strategies with respect to foraging behaviours of both species has until now, prevented any detailed understanding of this conspecific relationship. Here we combine stomach content analysis (SCA), nutritional composition of prey, a multidimensional nutritional niche framework (MNNF) and videography to provide a holistic dietary, nutritional, and behavioural assessment of the feeding association between dolphins and gannets in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. Dolphins consumed ten prey species, including grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) as the most representative by wet mass (33.4%). Gannets preyed upon six species, with pilchards (Sardinops pilchardus) contributing most of the diet by wet mass (32.4%) to their diet. Both predators jointly preyed upon pilchard, jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.), arrow squid (genus Nototodarus), and anchovy (Engraulis australis). Accordingly, the MNNF revealed a moderate overlap in the prey composition niche (0.42) and realized nutritional niche (0.52) between dolphins and gannets. This suggests that both predators coexist in a similar nutritional space, while simultaneously reducing interspecific competition and maximizing the success of both encountering and exploiting patchily distributed prey. Behavioural analysis further indicated that dolphin and gannets feeding associations are likely to be mutually beneficial, with a carouselling foraging strategy and larger pod sizes of dolphins, influencing the diving altitude of gannets. Our approach provides a new, more holistic understanding of this iconic foraging relationship, which until now has been poorly understood. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals often accumulate high levels of environmental contaminants, even those that are globally regulated regarding usage, raising concerns about their health status. Here, we conducted the first investigation of tissue distribution, spatiotemporal trends, and potential risks of six organotin compounds (OTs) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (n = 101) from the northern South China Sea during 2003-2021. We detected the highest level of hepatic triphenyltin in these humpback dolphins compared with the results reported in cetaceans globally, and the liver accumulated the highest OT concentrations than other analyzed tissues. Despite the downward trend of butyltins in humpback dolphins after the global ban on the use of OTs as antifouling paints, levels of phenyltins have continued to increase over the past 20 years, suggesting that the other applications of phenyltins in South China remain prevalent. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that tissue-relevant doses of OTs could induce agonistic effects on the dolphin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γas a master regulator of lipid homeostasis and altered the dolphin fatty acid profiles. Our results highlight the lipid-disrupting effects of current OT exposure in humpback dolphins and emphasize the need for further efforts to eliminate OT contamination in South China.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Animals sometimes forage in mixed species groups, where an individual of a “follower” species actively trails a foraging individual of another “nuclear” species to benefit from the latter’s foraging strategy. Here, we report on a serendipitous observation of a large, benthic, reef-associated predator, the nurse shark (G. cirratum) following a pod of bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus) in an apparent attempt to feed on benthic prey disturbed by dolphin foraging. Data from a shark-borne camera, accelerometer, depth, and temperature datalogger package show the nurse shark following the dolphin pod for a period of 15 min and performing multiple, rapid vertical ascents from a depth of 24 m to near the surface following dolphins. The shark performed gliding descents behind dolphins back to the benthos and repeatedly swam through clouds of sand that were produced from dolphin crater feeding behavior. The dolphins appeared to ignore the shark except for three occasions when they struck the shark in the head with their caudal flukes. The shark eventually appeared to locate a benthic prey item as it turned sharply, stopped swimming, and performed what appeared to be suction feeding near the bottom, with clouds of sand rapidly expelled from its gills. This is the first report of rapid vertical ascents and interspecific foraging in a nurse shark. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is a critically endangered cetacean species endemic to coastal Atlantic waters of Africa. Its preference for shallow coastal habitat renders it vulnerable to incidental capture (bycatch) in non-selective fishing gears as well as to habitat degradation from all forms of coastal development. Although past and ongoing research has shed light on the distribution and conservation status of the species in a few locations, it is still poorly understood throughout most of the 19 countries in its 7000 km long range. From 2020 onward, international and regional collaboration to increase awareness and promote conservation action has intensified. These efforts, while in the early stages, exemplify the IUCN Species Survival Commission’s Assess-Plan-Act Conservation Cycle. While concrete conservation gains have not yet been achieved, efforts are being made to fill knowledge gaps and to broaden and motivate the network of international, regional, national, and local stakeholders that are actively engaged in marine and coastal conservation actions at multiple levels. The authors assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current approaches and identify elements that may be useful for other species with ranges spanning multiple countries where resources and capacity for conservation action are limited. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The impacts of environmental changes and anthropogenic threats in marine mammals are a growing concern for their conservation. In recent years, efforts have been directed to understand how marine mammals cope with stressors and to assess and validate stress biomarkers, mainly levels of glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol) in certain body tissues. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of different causes of stranding (chronically affected and bycaught striped dolphins) on cortisol concentrations in serum and in blubber; and to evaluate the association between cortisol levels in these tissues. Blubber and blood samples were collected from striped dolphins (n = 42) stranded on the Mediterranean coast between 2012 and 2018. Cortisol concentrations were measured by using enzyme immunoassay. A high correlation was found between circulating and blubber cortisol concentrations (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.01). Necropsies and pathological studies concluded that a third of the dolphins were bycaught in fishing nets and released by fishermen (Bycaught animals group), while the other two thirds were euthanized, or died, due to a disease or chronic condition (e.g. calves separated from the mother or animals infected with dolphin morbillivirus or Brucella ceti) that impeded survival (Chronically affected animals group). Cortisol concentrations (mean ± SD) were six times higher in chronically affected animals (35.3 ± 23 ng cortisol/g blubber and 6.63 ± 3.22 μg cortisol/dl serum) compared to those bycaught in fishing nets (6.2 ± 4.3 ng cortisol/g blubber and 1.15 ± 1.51 μg cortisol/dl serum). Results suggests that serum and blubber cortisol concentrations can contribute in inferring the overall health and welfare of free-ranging cetaceans. However, further research is required to understand better the kinetics of blubber cortisol incorporation and removal, the factors involved in these processes, and the local conversion of cortisol in the blubber. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Vessel traffic is one of the major sources of underwater anthropogenic noise. Dolphins can modify their vocal repertoire, especially whistles, in presence of vessels to facilitate their communication. Acoustic data were collected (sampling rate 96 kHz) in La Paz Bay, Gulf of California, Mexico. Whistle rate and parameters of the coastal and oceanic ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were measured in absence of vessels and in presence of moving small vessels (size 5–10 m). The peak noise difference was calculated between the two frequency bands dominated by the whistles (2000–20,000 Hz) and the small vessel (500–2000 Hz). In presence of vessels the oceanic ecotype decreased whistle frequencies while the coastal ecotype increased them. Both ecotypes raised whistle frequencies with the decreasing of the peak noise difference. The differences in habitat and group structure could have driven the two ecotypes to react in a different way to the vessel presence. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Mycotic diseases are considered a worldwide growing concern related to public health. Lobomycosis like disease (LLD) (Lacazia loboi) is a chronic and progressive infection in skin of humans and small cetaceans present in both sides of the Americas, including Mexico but information is still limited. Marine predators are indicators of potential risks for human and wildlife health, including fungal diseases like LLD in bottlenose dolphins. Here we report the first findings of an initial assessment in LLD epidemiology, pathology, and behavioral constraints of coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico (SWGM). Overall, LLD prevalence in the population was low, within ranges reported for the species, and only in highly associated unisexual pairs near the Alvarado coastal waters. Photo-identified individuals exhibited an annual increase in average progression for LLD skin lesions. Gross lesions and skin biopsy evidenced mycotic structures and subcutaneous alterations associated to LLD. Habitat quality, demographic, and social characteristics of bottlenose dolphins are likely influencing LLD geographical expansion and temporal prevalence, but global and local climate variability may influence LLD epidemiology, implying a potential risk for human and dolphin health from coastal communities at the SWGM.

ABSTRACT: Coastal areas are associated with anthropogenic activities and stressors that can expose the marine fauna to negative cumulative impacts. Apex predators, such as dolphins, can flag the quality of their environment through health parameters such as cutaneous and body conditions. We examined the potential relationship between environmental conditions and health parameters of Guiana dolphins around a port and a conservation unit within the Paranaguá Estuarine Complex, southern Brazil. During boat surveys between July 2018 and April 2019 covering both areas, we measured environmental parameters, photographed dolphins to infer their health condition and the frequency of use of the estuary. In total, 204 individual Guiana dolphins were photo-identified, 52 of which were seen in both years. In general, dolphins showed poor body condition (76% classified as emaciated or thin in 2018, and 79% in 2019), diverse cutaneous conditions (four types of lesions suggestive of an infectious aetiology, two conditions suggestive of traumatic events of anthropogenic origin, and two anomalous pigmentation) and a high prevalence of such cutaneous conditions (85% in 2018, 70% in 2019). Most individuals maintained their body and cutaneous conditions between the two years. There were no clear differences between the port and the conservation areas in terms of environmental conditions, frequency of use and health conditions of individual dolphins, suggesting that dolphins inhabiting this estuarine complex are exposed to potential cumulative impacts, such as pollutants, noise and habitat degradation. This study provides baseline information on some health parameters of Guiana dolphins in southern Brazil and highlights the need for systematic, long-term health assessment of Guiana dolphin populations to guide conservation actions to safeguard this vulnerable species. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) disaster resulted in large-scale contamination of bays, sounds, and estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico, home to multiple stocks of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Inhalation, aspiration, ingestion, and dermal absorption of oil and its toxic components were all considered possible routes of exposure for dolphins living within the oil spill footprint. To determine if dolphins were adversely impacted, catch-and-release health assessments were performed in heavily-oiled Barataria Bay (BB), Louisiana, and in Sarasota Bay (SB), Florida, a comparison site with no DWH oil contamination. Initial studies were conducted as part of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (2011-2014) and follow-on studies were performed between 2016-2018 with support from the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative. Ultrasound was used to evaluate the dolphins’ pulmonary health, including the presence/absence of pleural effusion, nodules, masses, consolidation, and alveolar interstitial syndrome (AIS). When present, AIS was further graded by severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and distribution. Based on the presence and severity of abnormalities, each dolphin was given an overall lung disease score (normal, mild, moderate, or severe). Normal to mild scores were considered within expected limits for a wild population, therefore the prevalence of normal-mild versus moderate-severe scores was compared between the oiled and unoiled sites. Separate analyses were conducted for dolphins alive in 2010 (and in BB, presumably exposed to DWH oil), and those born after 2010. For the dolphins alive in 2010, temporal trends were also examined using generalized additive models (GAMs). Results showed a strong difference (p=0.000357) in moderate to severe lung disease between the two sites for dolphins alive in 2010, but no significant difference (p=0.6745) between the sites for dolphins born after 2010. In BB dolphins, the prevalence of moderate to severe lung disease did not decrease in the years after the spill, and in fact, potentially worsened (p=0.0644 for trend over years), with the highest prevalence (0.61) being in 2018. Moderate to severe AIS remained a persistent finding in BB dolphins, and several animals had a pattern of AIS that was more severe ventrally than dorsally, with evidence of chronic, progressive disease states.

ABSTRACT: Forward masking was investigated by the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) method in a bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus using stimulation by two successive acoustic pulses (the masker and test) projected from spatially separated sources. The positions of the two sound sources either coincided with or were symmetrical relative to the head axis at azimuths from 0 to ± 90°. AEPs were recorded either from the vertex or from the lateral head surface next to the auditory meatus. In the last case, the test source was ipsilateral to the recording side, whereas the masker source was either ipsi- or contralateral. For lateral recording, AEP release from masking (recovery) was slower for the ipsi- than for the contralateral masker source position. For vertex recording, AEP recovery was equal both for the coinciding positions of the masker and test sources and for their symmetrical positions relative to the head axis. The data indicate that at higher levels of the auditory system of the dolphin, binaural convergence makes the forward masking nearly equal for ipsi- and contralateral positions of the masker and test. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Line transect aerial surveys are widely used for estimating abundance of biological populations, including threatened species. However, estimates obtained with data collected from aircraft are often underestimated because of visibility bias and bias in estimating group sizes from a fast-moving platform. An assessment of multiple sources of bias in aerial surveys were carried out in Brazilian coastal waters by experiments on multiple survey platforms (i.e., boat, airplane and helicopter). These studies focused on evaluating visibility bias (perception and availability bias) and potential differences in the estimation of group sizes from different types of platforms used in franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) abundance surveys. The ultimate goal was to develop correction factors to improve accuracy of estimates of density and population size for this threatened dolphin. Estimates of density and group sizes computed from boats were assumed to be unbiased and were compared to estimates of these quantities obtained from an airplane in the same area and period. In addition, helicopter surveys were conducted in two areas where water turbidity differed (clear vs. murky waters) to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscana groups and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Abundance computed from the aerial survey data underestimated the true abundance by about 4-5 times, with ~70% of the total bias resulting from visibility bias (~80% from availability bias and ~20% from perception bias) and ~30% from bias in estimates of group size. The use of multiple survey platforms in contrasting habitats provided the opportunity to compute correction factors that can be used to refine range wide abundance estimates of the threatened franciscana given certain assumptions are met. Visibility bias and group size bias were substantial and clearly indicate the importance for accounting for such correction factors to produce unequivocal population assessment based on aerial survey data.

ABSTRACT: By-catch is the most direct threat to marine mammals globally. Acoustic repellent devices (pingers) have been developed to reduce dolphin by-catch. However, mixed results regarding their efficiency have been reported. Here, we present a new bio-inspired acoustic beacon, emitting returning echoes from the echolocation clicks of a common dolphin ‘Delphinus delphis’ from a fishing net, to inform dolphins of its presence. Using surface visual observations and the automatic detection of echolocation clicks, buzzes, burst-pulses and whistles, we assessed wild dolphins’ behavioural responses during sequential experiments (i.e., before, during and after the beacon’s emission), with or without setting a net. When the device was activated, the mean number of echolocation clicks and whistling time of dolphins significantly increased by a factor of 2.46 and 3.38, respectively (p < 0.01). Visual surface observations showed attentive behaviours of dolphins, which kept a distance of several metres away from the emission source before calmly leaving. No differences were observed among sequences for buzzes/burst-pulses. Our results highlight that this prototype led common dolphins to echolocate more and communicate differently, and it would favour net detection. Complementary tests of the device during the fishing activities of professional fishermen should further contribute to assessment of its efficiency. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Animals with fission–fusion dynamics live in fluid societies with varying party sizes. The joining (fusion) and separation (fission) of these parties is considered a response to costs and benefits associated with grouping. This study investigates which factors influence grouping and fission–fusion dynamics in common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in Portugal. Between June and October of 2016 and 2017, 94 boat-based group focal follows were conducted, resulting in 2410, 2-min behavioral samples. Using generalized linear models, we examined how mother-calf pair presence, behavioral state, and temporal variability influence party size. We used generalized estimating equations to model behavior and fission–fusion dynamics, testing the responses to mother-calf presence and time. Parties were smaller when mother-calf pairs were absent or when animals were resting. Socializing parties without mother-calf pairs were more likely to be observed than traveling parties with mother-calf pairs. Compared to traveling, foraging was less likely in September and October than in June, and resting was more likely in September. Compared to stable state, parties without mother-calf pairs were more likely to fission than parties with mother-calf pairs and fusion events became less likely by advancing hour. We revealed that common dolphins in Southern Portugal exhibit a high degree of fission–fusion dynamics that are predominantly influenced by mother-calf presence, confirming the importance of this region as a nursery ground. By assessing fine-scale social dynamics in common dolphins, this study advances understanding of the evolutionary drivers shaping grouping patterns in wild cetaceans while also providing an important comparative counterpoint to terrestrial fission–fusion dynamics. Significance statement: Dolphin species are known for their fission-fusion societies with extensive intra- and interspecific variation in their social organization. This work provided an opportunity for new insights into the social lives of common dolphins in the South of Portugal and how social factors such as mother-calf pair presence, behavioral state, and temporal variability shape the social organization of this species. We found that common dolphins present a highly fluid organization and that the presence of mother-calf pairs plays a major role, affecting party size, behavior, and fission-fusion rate. Our work also confirms the relevance of Southern Portugal as an important calving and nursery area for this species, and therefore, it is essential that wise management practices are implemented in order to maintain a healthy population. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Globally, the threat of endangerment and extinction of small cetaceans was highlighted after the recent extinction of the Chinese River dolphin or Baiji (Lipotes vexillifer). Species with a small population size and a limited geographic range, such as Ganges River dolphins (GRD), are more vulnerable to extinction. The social and behavioral needs of cetaceans have been identified as potential factors increasing their vulnerability to human disturbance. However, little is known about how GRD adapt their behaviors and diel activity patterns to spatiotemporal variation. In this paper, we examined the underwater behavior of GRDs in Nepal by collecting echolocation clicks from three spatially stratified habitats in the Sapta Koshi River system over a six-month period. Our research found that GRDs behave differently in response to spatial heterogeneity, indicating diverse environmental requirements for GRD persistence. Behavioral activity and duration varied across habitats but not across time of day, suggesting that GRD behaviors are likely to be regulated by habitat structure regardless of the time of day. However, GRD consistently exhibited nocturnal activity peaks even when diurnal activity varied substantially. This indicates that river dolphins may favor nocturnal refuges as a reaction to human disturbance in highly regulated rivers. Managing human disturbances in conjunction with habitat heterogeneity can improve the persistence of riverine cetaceans. Here, we document behavioral and ecological information pertaining to GRD, which is essential to the formation of river dolphin recovery plans that link ecological perspectives to planning and management. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: High levels of standing genomic variation in wide-ranging marine species may enhance prospects for their long-term persistence. Patterns of connectivity and adaptation in such species are often thought to be influenced by spatial factors, environmental heterogeneity, and oceanographic and geomorphological features. Population-level studies that analytically integrate genome-wide data with environmental information (i.e., seascape genomics) have the potential to inform the spatial distribution of adaptive diversity in wide-ranging marine species, such as many marine mammals. We assessed genotype-environment associations (GEAs) in 214 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) along > 3000 km of the southern coast of Australia. Results: We identified 747 candidate adaptive SNPs out of a filtered panel of 17,327 SNPs, and five putatively locally-adapted populations with high levels of standing genomic variation were disclosed along environmentally heterogeneous coasts. Current velocity, sea surface temperature, salinity, and primary productivity were the key environmental variables associated with genomic variation. These environmental variables are in turn related to three main oceanographic phenomena that are likely affecting the dispersal of common dolphins: (1) regional oceanographic circulation, (2) localised and seasonal upwellings, and (3) seasonal on-shelf circulation in protected coastal habitats. Signals of selection at exonic gene regions suggest that adaptive divergence is related to important metabolic traits. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first seascape genomics study for common dolphins (genus Delphinus). Information from the associations between populations and their environment can assist population management in forecasting the adaptive capacity of common dolphins to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment is a crucial element for the promotion of welfare of animals kept under human care. While a large variety of environmental enrichments has been proposed and studied for terrestrial animals, including a growing area represented by acoustical enrichment such as music, the same is not true for marine mammals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of classical music to act as an enrichment for bottlenose dolphins under human care (Tursiops truncatus); its effect on the dolphins’ behaviour were compared with that of a less complex auditory stimulus (rain sound), another novel, but visual enrichment (slideshow of photographs), and an already known form of enrichment (floating objects). The study was conducted on 8 dolphins housed in a dolphinarium in Riccione, Italy. Enrichments were provided for 20 min/day, on 7 days for each enrichment type. Their effect was evaluated by observing changes in behaviours expressed during or shortly after the provision of the enrichment. Some effects were unspecific, being shared by most, or all types of enrichment, including an increase of activity levels and synchronous swimming. However, only classical music was able to increase several social affiliative behaviours both during its presentation and after its removal. The results indicate that classical music has positive effects on behaviour, that qualify it as an effective environmental enrichment for dolphins in this context. Some aspects remain to be elucidated, including the mechanisms by which music exerts its effects, and how specific to classical music the latter are. Nonetheless, the specificity of effects on social behaviour suggest that classical music could be particularly useful when an improvement in social behaviours is needed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Interactions between bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and fishing gear have negative impacts on both dolphins and fisheries. Therefore, the damage and economic loss caused to the purse seine fishery were evaluated on a spatio-temporal scale, and the catch composition was addressed. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the fishers, and observations aboard the boat were recorded between August 2018 and July 2019 in the M'diq region, northwestern Morocco. Throughout the study period, the frequency of fishing trips attacked by bottlenose dolphins was 44.75% (n=324), and the catch damage was 33%. In addition, depredated fishing operations were significantly lower in CPUE than unattacked ones. The total mending cost was 35,533.3$, with a difference between months and seasons. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) attacked 32.2% of the fishing operations. However, this frequency of fishing operations depredated by depth was not significant. The current study proved that these interactions inflict substantial economic losses on the fishers of this region. © 2022, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

ABSTRACT: A total of 164 blood samples from 16 clinically healthy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), were obtained from an aquarium in Spain between 2019 and 2020, as part of their preventive medicine protocol. In addition to conventional haematological and biochemical analyses, plasmatic B-esterase activities were characterised to determine the potential application of such analyses in wild counterparts. The hydrolysis rates for the substrates of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and carboxylesterase (CE) activity in plasma were measured, the last using two commercial substrates, p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) and p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB). Activity rates (mean ± SEM in nmol/min/mL plasma) were (in descending order): AChE (125.6 ± 3.8), pNPB-CE (65.0 ± 2.2), pNPA-CE (49.7 ± 1.1) and BuChE (12.8 ± 1.3). These values for dolphins are reported in here for the first time in this species. Additionally, the in vitro sensitivity of two B-esterases (AChE and pNPB-CE) to chemicals of environmental concern was determined, and the protective role of plasmatic albumin assessed. Out of the B-esterases measured in plasma of dolphin, AChE activity was more responsive in vitro to pesticides, while CEs had a low response to plastic additives, likely due to the protective presence of albumin. However, the clear in vitro interaction of these environmental chemicals with purified AChE from electric eels and recombinant human hCEs (hCE1 and hCE2) and albumin, predicts their impact in other tissues that require in vivo validation. A relationship between esterase-like activities and health parameters in terrestrial mammals has already been established. Thus, B-esterase measures could be easily included in marine mammal health assessment protocols for dolphins as well, once the relationship between these measures and the animal's fitness has been established. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Current estimates of marine mammal hydrodynamic forces tend to be made using camera-based kinematic data for a limited number of fluke strokes during a prescribed swimming task. In contrast, biologging tag data yield kinematic measurements from thousands of strokes, enabling new insights into swimming behavior and mechanics. However, there have been limited tag-based estimates of mechanical work and power. In this work, we investigated bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) swimming behavior using tag-measured kinematics and a hydrodynamic model to estimate propulsive power, work and cost of transport. Movement data were collected from six animals during prescribed straight-line swimming trials to investigate swimming mechanics over a range of sustained speeds (1.9-6.1 m s-1). Propulsive power ranged from 66 W to 3.8 kW over 282 total trials. During the lap trials, the dolphins swam at depths that mitigated wave drag, reducing overall drag throughout these mid- to high-speed tasks. Data were also collected from four individuals during undirected daytime (08:30-18:00 h) swimming to examine how self-selected movement strategies are used to modulate energetic efficiency and effort. Overall, self-selected swimming speeds (individual means ranging from 1.0 to 1.96 m s-1) tended to minimize cost of transport, and were on the lower range of animal-preferred speeds reported in literature. The results indicate that these dolphins moderate propulsive effort and efficiency through a combination of speed and depth regulation. This work provides new insights into dolphin swimming behavior in both prescribed tasks and self-selected swimming, and presents a path forward for continuous estimates of mechanical work and power from wild animals. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Few studies have analyzed the indicators of oxidative stress in marine mammals following exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS); sex and maturity-related differences have not been explored. The objective of this study was to compare the indicators of oxidative stress following exposure to LPS for 24 and 48 h in isolated Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; N = 12) leukocytes in relation to sex and maturity stage, using spectrophotometry. Following 48 h under experimental conditions (10 μg LPS mL−1), the leukocytes from males (n = 5) produced significantly more superoxide radical (O2•-; F (1, 8) = 13.965, p = 0.006) and displayed significantly greater activities of catalase (CAT; F (1, 8) = 9.465, p = 0.015) and glutathione S-transferase (GST; p = 0.028) compared to the leukocytes from females (n = 7). Following 48 h under experimental conditions, maturity-stage did not significantly influence the indicators of oxidative stress. Mature bottlenose dolphins (n = 7) had a significantly higher average daily dietary intake compared to immature bottlenose dolphins (n = 5; F (1, 10) = 5.825, p = 0.036). These results suggest that sex-related strategies for coping with a proinflammatory challenge may be present within the leukocytes from bottlenose dolphins, while potential maturity stage-related strategies require further investigation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The most eastern population of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Mediterranean Sea inhabits the southern coastal waters of Israel. They are mainly observed in the shallow waters off Ashdod and Ashkelon, between the 15-30 m isobaths, with no reported observations north or west of this area. These dolphins were observed and studied year-round between 2016-2021 using boat-based surveys and photo identification methods. Common dolphins were encountered and photographed 43 times during the study period, resulting in 2,851 identifications of 25 distinctive mature individuals and 12 calves. Most individuals (62%) were sighted over multiple years, with high yearly and monthly sighting rates, indicating long-term site fidelity and residency. Closed population mark-recapture models estimated a total abundance of 25 (95% CI 24 – 37) individuals in 2016 that declined to only 15 (95% CI 15 – 15) individuals in 2021. Social network analysis described these remaining individuals as one closed and well-associated social unit. Survival probabilities for this population appeared lower than those of other delphinid populations. The decrease in their abundance, coupled with their apparent isolation level, qualifies the local population for a re-assessment of their conservation status. This study first describes the Israeli local population of common dolphins, their dynamics and an assessment of their status based on the IUCN Red List framework.

ABSTRACT: An opportunistic sighting of an Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) was reported in the nearshore waters off the east Liaodong Peninsula, China. This is the first at-sea sighting in this area, and the northern-most sighting record of this species with a distance >3000 km away from the nearest described conspecific population located in the mid-China. The present sighting occurred in close proximity to the location at which another Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin was found by-caught in 2003. The sighted individual could not be identified through the existing photo-identification catalogues of this species in China (>3500 individuals). Therefore, we suggest that a population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins that was never reported might exist in the north of the Yellow Sea. © The Author(s), 2022.

ABSTRACT: Phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals added to plastics, personal care products, cleaning solutions, and pesticides. Extensive use has led to its exposure to wildlife, including common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA; however, there are gaps in knowledge regarding whether sample timing or geographic location influence exposure. Dolphins were evaluated for temporal and spatial variability in urinary mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) detection (2010–2019). Significant fluctuations in detectable MEHP concentrations were found across the dataset. All samples from 2014 and 2015 (n = 12) had detectable MEHP concentrations; thus, data were classified into cohorts to explore the significance of prevalent MEHP detection (“Cohort 1” (n = 10; 2010–2013), “Cohort 2” (2014–2015), and “Cohort 3” (n = 29; 2016–2019)). Compared to Cohorts 1 and 3, Cohort 2 had higher detectable MEHP concentrations (Dunn’s; p = 0.0065 and p = 0.0012, respectively) and a greater proportion of detectable MEHP concentrations (pairwise comparisons using Benjamini–Hochberg adjustments: p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0059, respectively). MEHP detection also varied across spatial scales. Dolphins with detectable MEHP concentrations had ranges primarily within enclosed embayments, while dolphins with nondetectable MEHP concentrations extended into open waters, potentially indicating geographically linked exposure risk. This study suggests that researchers and management agencies should consider a population’s ranging pattern, geographic habitat characteristics, and sample timing when assessing small cetacean health in relation to contaminant exposure. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are known to depredate fishing gear, resulting in damage to the catch and/or the gear itself. The extent of this damage and estimated financial loss varies between areas, mCrossed D sign©tiers, and survey methods. We quantified losses due to bottlenose dolphin depredation in a coastal gillnet fishery in the Thermaikos Gulf, Greece, in terms of CPUE reduction, catch damage, and gear damage. Experimental fishing effort was carried out over two seasons (2020 and 2021), along with concurrent questionnaire surveys over the second season (2021). Depredation frequency (∼35%) and CPUE changes due to depredation (a significant decrease of 45-50%) were similar for both sampling schemes. The number of damaged fish in experimental hauls increased significantly with dolphin depredation, but did not fully account for the sizeable loss in marketable catch, indicating that large numbers of fish were removed from the nets entirely. Damage to experimental nets increased with dolphin presence and group size, with an average of 0.59% of net surface area damaged per depredation event. Both datasets point to annual economic losses of over €5000 per vessel in this fishery, while the similarity between direct observations and self-reported losses highlights the usefulness of frequent questionnaire surveys. © 2022 Oxford University Press.

ABSTRACT: Reserve planning based on the investigation of the core habitat distribution of wild cetaceans is a powerful conservation strategy for protecting target species. However, studies on core habitats and their variations at the large-scale distribution of cetaceans are limited. In this study, we conducted a seven years (2015-2021) boat-based field observation surveys with highly applicable and generalized methods to analyze the habitat changes and how these changes influenced the largest known Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) population in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. Our findings revealed that there is 3204 km2 of dolphin habitat in the PRE, and dolphin distribution preferences are related to nutrients and biological resources. The decreasing trend of dolphin sighting rates in most areas (73.2%) indicated that the dolphin habitat had declined, and the annual habitat decline rate (2.83%; 95% confidence interval: 0.58%-5.08%) was consistent with the population decline rate. The annual habitat decline rate in the hypoxic zone revealed that low dolphin sighting rates from March to October in the hypoxic zone was 0.43% faster than that in the non-hypoxic zone, indicating long-term sustained effects of summer hypoxia on the dolphin population. Existing reserves have partially prevented habitat decline. However, more than 82.3% of the habitat has not been effectively protected and encounters the threats of pollution and hypoxic stress. This study offers new scientific evidence for developing effective monitoring strategies for humpback dolphin populations in the PRE, and also help establish spatial planning and management measures for reserve habitats.

ABSTRACT: Group living is a critical component of the ecology of social animals such as delphinids. In many studies on these animals, groups represent sampling units that form the basis of the collection and analysis of data on their abundance, behavior, and social structure. Nevertheless, defining what constitutes a group has proven problematic. There is inconsistency in the terms and criteria used and many definitions lack biological justification. We conducted a literature review and an online expert survey to assess various terms (group, school, party, and pod), and their definitions as applied to delphinids to identify issues to ultimately make recommendations. Of 707 studies analyzed, 325 explicitly defined one or more terms, providing 344 definitions. Additionally, 192 definitions were obtained from the survey. Among these definitions, group was the most common term used (review: 286 definitions, 83.1%; survey: 69 definitions, 35.9%) and the most familiar to the survey respondents (73 respondents, 100.0%). In definitions of group, spatial proximity was the most used criterion (review: 200 definitions, 71.2%; survey: 53 definitions, 81.5%) followed by behavior (review: 176 definitions, 62.6%; survey: 38 definitions, 58.5%). The terms and criteria used to define delphinid groups vary considerably. Rather than proposing a single formal definition, we instead recommend that the term group and spatial proximity criteria be used to define sampling units of individuals observed in the field. Furthermore, we propose a process for formulating definitions that involves analyzing interindividual distances to determine naturally occurring patterns that are indicative of group membership. Although this process is based principally on the spatial proximity of individuals, it could also incorporate the behavior of group members by evaluating the influence of behavior on interindividual distances. Such a process produces definitions that are biologically meaningful and compatible across studies and populations, thus increasing our ability to draw strong conclusions about group living in delphinids. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins gain information through echolocation, a publicly accessible sensory system in which dolphins produce clicks and process returning echoes, thereby both investigating and contributing to auditory scenes. How their knowledge of these scenes contributes to their echoic information-seeking is unclear. Here, we investigate their top–down cognitive processes in an echoic matching-to-sample task in which targets and auditory scenes vary in their decipherability and shift from being completely unfamiliar to familiar. A blind-folded adult male dolphin investigated a target sample positioned in front of a hydrophone to allow recording of clicks, a measure of information-seeking and effort; the dolphin received fish for choosing an object identical to the sample from 3 alternatives. We presented 20 three-object sets, unfamiliar in the first five 18-trial sessions with each set. Performance accuracy and click counts varied widely across sets. Click counts of the four lowest-performance-accuracy/low-discriminability sets (X = 41%) and the four highest-performance-accuracy/high-discriminability sets (X = 91%) were similar at the first sessions’ starts and then decreased for both kinds of scenes, although the decrease was substantially greater for low-discriminability sets. In four challenging-but-doable sets, number of clicks remained relatively steady across the 5 sessions. Reduced echoic effort with low-discriminability sets was not due to overall motivation: the differential relationship between click number and object-set discriminability was maintained when difficult and easy trials were interleaved and when objects from originally difficult scenes were grouped with more discriminable objects. These data suggest that dolphins calibrate their echoic information-seeking effort based on their knowledge and expectations of auditory scenes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Trace elements bioaccumulation patterns can be an important tool to assess differences among cetaceans’ populations. In this work, their use as potential chemical markers to differentiate franciscanas (Pontoporia blainvillei) populations was evaluated. Franciscanas were collected from three states in southeastern Brazil, which comprise three different Franciscana Management Areas (FMAs): Espírito Santo (FMA Ia), southern Rio de Janeiro (FMA IIa), and central São Paulo (FMA IIb). The concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn and Zn were determined in the muscle, liver and kidney of the animals. Cadmium was the most valuable chemical marker to differentiate stocks, separating at least FMA IIa from the others. The higher Cd levels in FMA IIa, along with dietary information, indicate that the predominant consumption of cephalopods by this population is the main reason for the differences found. Additionally, environmental characteristics of the areas should also be considered as divergent sources of trace elements. Our findings suggest that non-essential trace elements, such as Cd, can be successful markers to differentiate populations. The Mn concentrations in FMA Ia raised concern and must be carefully monitored, as well as other elements that compose the iron ore tailings that have impacted the Espírito Santo coastal area. Additionally, this is the first study to report trace element concentration in the franciscanas from FMA IIa (southern Rio de Janeiro). Trace element concentrations found in franciscanas may represent different contamination levels in their preys and environments, which might pose specific threats to distinct populations. Therefore, our findings are important to characterize and differentiate franciscana populations and to guide precise management and conservation actions for the distinct stocks of this endangered species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding the effects of human care on the dynamics of the host-associated microbiota is critical for the health management of dolphins living in an aquarium. Yet this aspect remains relatively unexplored. Here, by utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we profiled the blowhole and gut bacterial communities of two bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and a Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis) reared in the same indoor pool, based on year-round surveillance. In addition, we compared these dolphin microbiotas with those previously published datasets from wild dolphins. Our results showed that both the blowhole and the gut of the two dolphin species under human care shared a more similar microbiome than members of the same dolphin species across different habitats (human care vs wild). However, the effects of human care on the dolphin microbiome from the two body sites varied. In the aquarium, bacterial alpha diversities differed significantly between the two body sites, and the seasonal stability of the bacterial community was more evident in the gut than in the blowhole. Additionally, the blowhole bacterial composition and the predicted functional capacity from the two dolphin species showed differences and were less convergent than their gut microbiota over a decade-long cohabitation. Further analyses showed that heterogeneous and homogeneous selections (i.e., deterministic processes) contributed more to the blowhole than to the gut bacterial communities, while a dispersal limitation (i.e., a stochastic process) was more important for the gut microbiota. The present study provides the first comparative evidence that the gut microbiota may be more plastic in response to the human care environment than the blowhole microbiota. This improves our understanding of dolphin health management under human care and helps to predict their microbial responses to environmental changes.

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) produce individually distinctive signature whistles that are learned early in life and that help animals recognize and maintain contact with conspecifics. Signature whistles are the predominant whistle type produced when animals are isolated from conspecifics. Health assessments of dolphins in Sarasota, Florida (USA) provide a unique opportunity to record signature whistles, as dolphins are briefly separated from conspecifics. Recordings were first made in the mid 1970’s, and then nearly annually since 1984. The Sarasota Dolphin Whistle Database (SDWD) now contains 926 recording sessions of 293 individual dolphins, most of known age, sex, and matrilineal relatedness. The longest time span over which an individual has been recorded is 43 years, and 85 individuals have been recorded over a decade or more. Here we describe insights about signature whistle structure revealed by this unique and expansive dataset. Signature whistles of different dolphins show great variety in their fundamental frequency contours. Signature whistle types (with ‘whistle type’ defined as all whistles visually categorized as sharing a particular frequency modulation pattern) can consist of a single stereotyped element, or loop (single-loop whistles), or of multiple stereotyped loops with or without gaps (multi-loop whistles). Multi-loop signature whistle types can also show extensive variation in both number and contour of loops. In addition, fundamental frequency contours of all signature whistle types can be truncated (deletions) or embellished (additions), and other features are also occasionally incorporated. However, even with these variable features, signature whistle types tend to be highly stereotyped and easily distinguishable due to the extensive variability in contours among individuals. In an effort to quantify this individual distinctiveness, and to compare it to other species, we calculated Beecher’s Information Statistic and found it to be higher than for any other animal signal studied so far. Thus, signature whistles have an unusually high capacity to convey information on individual identity. We briefly review the large range of research projects that the SDWD has enabled thus far, and look ahead to its potential to answer a broad suite of questions about dolphin communication.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a cosmopolitan delphinid, regularly present in the Mediterranean Sea. According to previous studies, this dolphin tends to form resident geographical units scattered on the continental shelf. We investigated how the physiographic characteristics of the area of residence, with special reference to the size and shape of the continental shelf, affect the home range and the group size of the local units. We analysed and compared data collected between 2004–2016 by 15 research groups operating in different study areas of the Mediterranean Sea: the Alboran Sea, in the South-Western Mediterranean, the Gulf of Lion and the Pelagos Sanctuary for the marine mammals, in the North-Western Mediterranean, and the Gulf of Ambracia, in the North-Central Mediterranean Sea. We have found that in areas characterised by a wide continental platform, dolphins have wider home ranges and aggregate into larger groups. In areas characterized by a narrow continental platform, dolphins show much smaller home ranges and aggregate into smaller groups. The results obtained from this collective research effort highlight the importance of data sharing to improve our scientific knowledge in the field of cetaceans and beyond. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Highly mobile odontocetes need habitats with environmental conditions with the potential of aggregating enough and high-quality prey, to maximize foraging success. Until now, the characterization of those habitats was in terms of physical and biological indicators of high production, capable of attracting and sustaining prey. Nevertheless, there has been no approach to quantifying the effects of a biophysical characteristic of the ocean with proven effects on the vertical distribution of prey for cetaceans: The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) depth. In the northern branch of the Humboldt Current System off Peru (~6-18° S), a shallow OMZ (30-50 m) affects the distribution of the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens), main prey for several marine predators, including dolphins. We hypothesized these predators would aggregate in productive areas, but with preference for places where the relative OMZ depth can constrain prey vertically, making it more accessible and maximizing foraging success. We fitted Bayesian habitat models for three dominant odontocete species in this region, with multiple combinations of environmental covariates, smoothing techniques, and temporal and spatial random effects. Cetacean data came from 23 dedicated surveys spanning 2001-2019. Habitat predictors included the spatial anomalies of sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyl-a, pycnocline depth and OMZ depth. Dusky (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) and common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) preferred productive, cold areas with a very shallow OMZ, regardless of the season, while bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) aggregated in both cold and warm waters, also with shallow OMZ. The former two species of higher metabolic demands would maximize energy intake by selecting areas with highly aggregated prey, while the latter, of more moderate metabolic needs and more diverse prey, would exploit less restricted habitats.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of protozoan parasites Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. such as the pathogenic bacteria Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli was molecularly investigated in the following free ranging species of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) as well as loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtles living in the Gulf of Taranto (Mediterranean Sea). Out of forty-one investigated individuals belonging to the 4 species, 13 (31.7%) were positive to one or more pathogens and zoonotic G. duodenalis assemblage A, Cryptosporidium parvum and S. enterica were identified in striped dolphins, loggerhead and green sea turtles. In this work, the presence of these opportunistic pathogens has been investigated in fecal samples of free ranging dolphin and sea turtle species for the first time. Moreover, this is the first record of C. parvum in loggerhead sea turtles. These results may provide baseline data for the potential role of cetaceans and sea turtles as potential sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study is the first baseline acoustic description of common bottlenose dolphin populations (Tursiops truncatus) from Revillagigedo Archipelago and the first identification of signature whistles (SWs) in an oceanic population of T. truncatus. A total of 85% (199/233) of the recorded whistles were classified as stereotyped whistles and subsequently (bout analysis/SIGID) categorized into one of five SW types. External observers were in perfect agreement in classifying whistles into the adopted SW categorization. SWs represented 42% (98/233) of the repertoire. Overall, most whistle types were categorized as sine (80%; SW1, SW2, SW4, and SW5) with one downsweep (20%, SW3). Roca Partida Island had the highest number of SW types. Principal component analysis explained 77% of the total SWs variance, highlighting the importance of shape/contour variables to the SWs variance. The combined mean SWs acoustic parameters from Revillagigedo Archipelago were higher than that recorded in coastal regions, which may indicate there are differences between SWs of pelagic and coastal populations. However, further acoustic and ecological studies in the Archipelago are needed to clarify and expand our findings, to identify its members (Photo ID and SW Revillagigedo Catalog), and to investigate this topic at other oceanic islands. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: This paper aims to explore the standing-and-hovering (SAH) behavior of dolphins on the water surface and to reveal its hydrodynamic mechanism through numerical simulations. A virtual dolphin-like swimmer is constructed to perform the three-stage locomotion for the SAH procedure. Volume of fluid method is adopted to deal with the free surface of multiphase flow, and the fluid-structure interaction is realized by using user-defined function and dynamic grid technology. The maximum water-exit height, hover height, energy change, efficiency, and stability are chosen to evaluate the SAH performance. The results show that with the increase of swing frequency and swing amplitude, the hover height increases linearly, and the energy obtained and consumed increases exponentially. Especially, as the swing amplitude increases, the efficiency shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Closer inspection reveals that different kinematic parameters of the swimmer may achieve the same hover height, but their energy consumption, efficiency, and hover stability are different. Therefore, according to the predetermined hover height, the optimal kinematic parameters could be obtained to achieve different hover goals. The findings provide an important hydrodynamic basis for the development of novel bionic robots with SAH capabilities that can perform both underwater and surface tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Dredging is an excavation activity used worldwide in marine and freshwater environments to create, deepen, and maintain waterways, harbours, channels, locks, docks, berths, river entrances, and approaches to ports and boat ramps. However, dredging impacts on marine life, including marine mammals (cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians), remain largely unknown. Here we quantified the effect of dredging operations in 2005 and 2019 on the occurrence of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and long-nosed fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) in the Port River estuary, a highly urbanized estuary in Adelaide, South Australia. We applied generalised linear models to two long-term sighting datasets (dolphins: 1992–2020, fur seals: 2010–2020), to analyse changes in sighting rates as a function of dredging operations, season, rainfall, and sea surface temperature. We showed that the fluctuations in both dolphin and fur seal occurrences were not correlated with dredging operations, whereas sea surface temperature and season were stronger predictors of both species sighting rates (with seals more prevalent during the colder months, and dolphins in summer). Given the highly industrial environment of the Port River estuary, it is possible that animals in this area are habituated to high noise levels and therefore were not disturbed by dredging operations. Future research would benefit from analysing short-term effects of dredging operations on behaviour, movement patterns and habitat use to determine effects of possible habitat alteration caused by dredging. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: First identified as an anorexigenic peptide, in the last decades, several studies have suggested that Nesfatin-1 (Nesf-1) is a pleiotropic hormone implicated in numerous regulatory processes in peripheral organs and tissues. In vertebrates, Nesf-1 is indeed expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. In this study, we characterized the pattern of Nesf-1 distribution within the digestive tract of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), composed of three gastric chambers and an intestine without a clear subdivision in the small and large intestine, also lacking a caecum. Our results indicated that Nesf-1 is widely distributed in cells of the mucosal epithelium of the gastric chambers. Most of the immunoreactivity was observed in the second chamber, compared to the first and third chambers. Immunopositivity was also found in nerve fibers and neurons, scattered or/and clustered in ganglion structures along all the examined gastrointestinal tracts. These observations add new data on the highly conserved role of Nesf-1 in the mammalian digestive system. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In the presence of vessels, dolphins have been found to change their habitat, behavior, group composition and whistle repertoire. The modification of the whistle parameters is generally considered to be a response to the engine noise. Little is known about the impact of the physical presence of vessels on dolphin acoustics. Whistle parameters of the coastal and oceanic ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins in La Paz Bay, Mexico, were measured after the approach of the research vessel and its engine shutdown. Recordings of 10 min were made immediately after turning off the engine. For analysis, these recordings were divided from minute 0 to minute 5, and from minute 5:01 to minute 10. The whistles of the oceanic ecotype showed higher maximum, minimum and peak frequency in the second time interval compared to the first one. The whistle rate decreased in the second time interval. The whistles of the coastal ecotype showed no difference between the two time intervals. The physical presence of the research vessel could have induced a change in the whistle parameters of the oceanic dolphins until habituation to the vessel disturbance. The oceanic ecotype could increase the whistle rate and decrease the whistle frequencies to maintain acoustic contact more frequently and for longer distances. The coastal ecotype, showing no significant changes in the whistle parameters, could be more habituated to the presence of vessels and display a higher tolerance. © Copyright 2022 Antichi et al.

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in estuarine systems are often subjected to natural and anthropogenic risks, which may impact their health and behaviors. Effective management for this species should incorporate continual, updated information on behavioral patterns of the individuals within populations. Currently, the Jacksonville Estuarine System stock assessment report, which includes dolphins in the St. Johns River (SJR) in northeast Florida, is based on data from the 1990s. Since then, dolphins’ use of the SJR has shifted, and the community has been impacted by two unusual mortality events (UME). This study analyzed site fidelity, space use and overlap, and social mixing with respect to the epizootic 2013–2015 UME, whose infectious agent was cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV). Examination of residency status determined that most dolphins sighted in the river were year-round residents (x¯ =45%, SD = 3.20). Space use and overlap of core areas occurred among residency categories but varied between cold and warm seasons and across time periods. There were key, highly connected individuals in the social network, which may have influenced disease transmission during the UME. Individuals infected by CeMV that stranded during the UME shared overlapping core areas with each other and with individuals from different residency categories. Altogether, this information on site fidelity, spatial overlap, and social mixing will help improve management plans for SJR dolphins, lead to better response efforts to future unusual mortality events, and increase the understanding of disease transmission in social species. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: Information on movements and connectivity among populations of animals is important for the delineation of units to conserve, so that demographic parameters, such as abundance, fecundity and mortality, can be placed in an appropriate population and conservation context. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are often considered relatively ‘resident’ and demonstrating strong site fidelity to specific areas. However, this perception may partly be an artefact of the distribution and ‘habitat use’ of cetacean researchers, rather than animals themselves, and bottlenose dolphins have been shown to be capable of substantial movements, often in relatively short periods of time. Here, we report on two long-distance movements of a common bottlenose dolphin within the Mediterranean Sea, across the Tyrrhenian, Ionian and Adriatic Seas, and subsequently back across all three seas to Ligurian Sea, making these the two longest recorded movement for this species in the Mediterranean Sea to date and some of the longest in the world. We also review published records of long-distance movements in this species worldwide. This study highlights the utility of photo-identification and the importance of regional data sharing. We argue that photo-identification comparisons are always worthwhile and the results are informative regardless of the presence or absence of matches, especially with the ongoing advances in automated matching software. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The photo-identification of uniquely marked individuals has revealed much about mammalian behaviour and social structure in recent decades. In bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), for example, the long-term tracking of individuals has unveiled considerable variation in social structure among populations and various spatio-temporal aspects of group formation. In this study, we investigated associations among individual males in a small community of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (T. aduncus) residing in an urbanized estuary in southwestern Australia. Given the relative proximity of our study area to other populations in which complex male alliances form for the purpose of mate acquisition, we used long-term photo-identification records and social analyses to assess whether such alliances also occur in smaller and more isolated settings. Our work revealed strong social bonds and long-term, non-random associations among individual males, suggesting the occurrence of male alliances. Behavioural observations of alliances interacting with potentially receptive adult females from the estuary community and from adjacent communities, and exhibiting sexual display behaviours near females, suggest that these alliances occur in a reproductive context. As the first formal analysis indicating the occurrence of male alliances outside Shark Bay along the vast western coastline of Australia, this study complements previous research and extends our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes that drive alliance formation. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Identifiable food remains were analyzed from 46 stomachs of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded in southern Spain between 2007 and 2014. Results suggest that the species feeds mainly on mesopelagic and neritic fish, but also on oceanic squids. Fish species of the family Myctophidae were the main prey in terms of numerical importance and reconstructed prey weight (62% N and 29% W), followed by squids of the family Ommastrephidae (20% W) and bogue (Boops boops) (15% W). The most important prey taxa according to the General Importance Index (GII) were C. maderensis, Ommastrephidae gen. spp., Notoscopelus spp., and M. punctatum. Higher number of mesopelagic myctophids were found in dolphins from the Mediterranean (73% vs. 29% N), while more demersal gobiids and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) were found in those from the Atlantic (44% vs. 1% and 8% vs. <1% N), where a more varied diet was also observed. Differences were also seen in the seasonal importance of some prey, as well as between years, sexes, and maturity states. The diet composition suggests that most of feeding occurred in oceanic regions, during twilight and night hours, while the observed dietary variation may reflect differences in topography, and changes in the prey availability. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The population of the Chinese white dolphin along Taiwan’s west coast is under a range of threats. The designation of marine protected areas (MPA) is urgently required for their protection. However, conflicts between specific species conservation and fishing rights mean that the success of such a designation relies on the fishers’ perceptions and awareness of an MPA. Designating offshore wind farms within MPAs can be a mechanism for minimizing conflicts between fisheries and conservation. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential for designating an offshore wind farm within an MPA for Chinese white dolphin conservation by exploring the attitudes of local fishers. This study used face-to-face questionnaires. The results show that the main challenges are conflicts of interest, insufficient science-based information, and inadequate law enforcement. Offshore wind farms could be a way to maximize the benefits for different stakeholders and positively impact the marine environment and ecosystem. This study makes feasible recommendations on how to improve conservation, promote renewable energy, and encourage sustainable fisheries. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Mirror-guided self-inspection is seen as a cognitive hallmark purportedly indicating the existence of self-recognition. Only a few species of great apes have been reported to pass a standard mark test for mirror self-recognition in which animals attempt to touch a mark. In addition, evidence for passing the mark test was also reported for Asian elephants, two species of corvids, and a species of cleaner fish. Mirror self-recognition has also been claimed for bottlenose dolphins, using exposure of marked areas to a mirror as evidence. However, what counts as self-directed behaviour to see the mark and what does not has been debated. To avoid this problem, we marked the areas around both eyes of the animals at the same time, one with visible and the other with transparent dye to control for haptic cues. This allowed the animal to see the mark easily and us to investigate what side was exposed to the mirror as an indicator for mark observation. We found that the animals actively chose to inspect their visibly marked side while they did not show an increased interest in a marked conspecific in the pool. These results demonstrate that dolphins use the mirror to inspect their marks and, therefore, likely recognise a distinction between self and others. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Of all animals considered subjects for instrumentation for behavioral or physiological studies, cetaceans probably represent the greatest challenge to the engineer and biologist. The marine environment being harsh to electronics, evasive behavior during tagging approaches and the short time window available to attach instruments, all imply a need for innovative tagging solutions to facilitate better understanding of their life cycle, migration, physiology, behavior, health and genetics. Several animal-attached tag packages holding specific data loggers, e.g., time depth recorders, position, orientation, acoustic and video recorders for short to medium term studies, as well as tags developed for large scale migration telemetry studies are available as off-the-shelf devices, or in many cases as custom made sensor packages. Deployment of those instruments is often the limiting factor for data collection. The Aerial Remote Tag System (ARTS) is a flexible system which can easily be adapted to deploy different tag sensor packages and biopsy collection devices. This paper presents the history and design of the ARTS, and accessories developed for instrumentation and biopsy sampling of cetaceans, such as the recent developed ARTS–LKDart for biopsy sampling. Deployment of archival tags usually requires radio tracking of the instrumented animal, or at least tracking of the tag for recovery. Thus, we also here describe the automatic digital signal processing radio direction finder, the Direction Finder Horten (DFHorten unit). © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: As long-term studies reveal, bottlenose dolphin communities comprise a complex network of individual relationships. Individuals form strong bonds (e.g., mother-calf or male partnerships), transient relationships, and also compete against each other for resources. Evidence of bonded partnerships is typically revealed by the years-long study of associations with repeated sightings. However, quickly determining which individuals have close affiliations would benefit both field researchers working to describe individual behavior as they engage in cognitive activities such as cooperative foraging as well as caregivers in zoos who must decide which individuals should be housed together. Observations in aquariums are well-suited for collecting long-term, detailed information on how pairs interact because subjects can always be found and their behavior both above and below the water can be seen well. These are conditions that are rare for most (but not all) ocean-based studies. We used multiple measures to detect affiliated behavior across several dimensions of pairwise affiliation. Specifically, we used association indices to measure the frequency of affiliative behavior, the symmetry of the partnership, the tenor of interactions, and the stability of which partners were strongly affiliated from year to year. Synchronous behavior and reciprocity in proximity-seeking are two examples of potential markers of an affiliative relationship where individual choices–to join, to move together, and to leave–are visible to observers. We found that the combined measures were effective at identifying one pair that maintained a strong, stable relationship across years, one individual that formed a moderately strong trio relationship with both members of the most-affiliated pair, and one individual who was more variable in his relationships. These social markers provide a means of rapidly identifying bonded males in both aquarium and ocean settings, particularly when long-term knowledge of individual histories is not available. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sociality and ecological drivers that can influence individual association patterns are infrequently considered in wildlife management, although they are essential aspects affecting animals’ responses to both human-related pressures and conservation strategies. In common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), sex-specific social dynamics and interactions with anthropogenic activities may affect grouping and induce changes in relationships between individuals. Out of a total of 347 individuals, we assessed the level of association among 68 bottlenose dolphins that have been sighted more than five times near the Roman coast (central Mediterranean Sea, Italy). The half-weight index (HWI) of dyadic associations, their network relations, and stability over time were investigated by using the SOCPROG software. Outcomes showed that females were more strongly associated than other individuals, with both preferred constant short-term associations and random long-term associations, possibly resulting in greater success in rearing young. Individuals interacting with the bottom trawl fishery showed weaker and short-term associations. Temporary disruption of individual associations during interaction with fishery and the relatively low number of females with calves participating in depredation seem to denote both the opportunistic nature of interactions with fishing vessels and the offspring-related protection strategy. The results show that the dolphins in this region maintain a complex but flexible social structure that varies with local biological requirements and is resilient to anthropogenic pressures.

ABSTRACT: Before the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, cruise ship tourism had been one of the fastest growing segments of global tourism, presenting a range of potential impacts. At Akaroa Harbour, Aotearoa New Zealand, the number of annual cruise ship visits more than quadrupled following earthquake damage to Ōtautahi Christchurch's Lyttelton Port in 2011. Akaroa Harbour is an area of core use for endangered and endemic Hector’s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori). Dolphins here are exposed to some of the highest levels of cetacean tourism in Aotearoa New Zealand. Relationships were examined between growth in cruise ship visits, as well as tours focused specifically on dolphins, and long-term trends in summer distribution of Hector’s dolphins at Akaroa Harbour, from 2000 to 2020. Core use areas for Hector’s dolphins within the harbour were quantified via kernel density estimation using data from 2,335 sightings from over 8,000 km of standardized survey effort. Data were allocated into four periods based on varying levels of tourism. Dolphin habitat preference varied over time, with the greatest change occurring between 2005–2011 and 2012–2015. When comparing these periods, the spatial overlap of core habitat was less than 24%. Dolphin distribution shifted towards the outer harbour after 2011 and has remained relatively consistent since. The observed shift in distribution coincided with the more than fourfold increase in annual cruise ship visits to Akaroa Harbour. Several pressures related to cruise ship tourism are likely to have influenced habitat preferences of dolphins. Further investigation into causal factors of the observed shift is warranted. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future of cruise ship and wildlife tourism is in flux. Our findings suggest that the future re-development of this industry should follow a precautionary approach, with the onus on industry to provide evidence of sustainability before proceeding. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins play a key role in marine food webs as predators of mid-trophic-level consumers. Because of their mobility and relatively long life span, they can be used as indicators of large-scale changes in the ecosystem. In this study, we calculated the trophic position (TP) of 5 dolphin species from the Canary, Madeira and Azores Islands using bulk and compound-specific stable isotope ratios from muscle tissue to assess trophic adaptations to recent changes in the availability of feeding resources. Dolphin TP values were then compared with those of 7 other species of cetaceans from this region. Analysis of stable nitrogen isotopes in amino acids of the common dolphin indicated non-significant effects of changes in the basal resources of the food web and thus supported the use of bulk samples for TP estimations. Dolphins occupied an intermediate TP (mean: 3.91 to 4.20) between fin (3.25) and sperm whales (4.95). Species-specific TP were equivalent among islands. However, TP increased for the common dolphin and decreased for the striped dolphin (the latter also becoming more oceanic) between 2000 and 2018 in the Canary Islands. These results suggest different impacts of recent changes in the oceanography and in the pelagic food web of the Macaronesian region on the trophic ecology of dolphin species. © 2022 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Abundance estimates of cetaceans are often acquired through capture-recapture analysis of photographically identified individuals. An alternative method, using capture-recapture of individually distinct signature whistles detected from acoustic underwater recording units, has recently been demonstrated. Here we investigate the effect of array configuration (1–3 hydrophones within 0.45 km2) and recording duty cycles (six variations of 33%, 50%, or 66% sampling periods) on the detection rate of dolphin signature whistles. Twenty-one signature whistle types were identified and used to create capture histories for each hydrophone and all potential array configurations. Open population models were used to estimate capture probabilities and precision for all data sets. The effect of different duty cycles on detectability were investigated by artificially applying six duty cycles to the continuously recorded data. Results demonstrate that location is more important than redundancy in small-scale arrays, even with detection distances as small as 750 m, and that duty cycling can increase survey durations without decreasing detectability. To acoustically sample intermittent signals of dispersed populations, it is more effective to space hydrophones further apart, in known high-use areas. This study provides insight into the application of capture-recapture to signature whistles, improving methods for long-term, noninvasive monitoring of elusive delphinids. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A fundamental problem in the evolution of cognition is the search for complex memory systems given the longstanding belief that complex cognition is unique to humans. Along these lines, new research suggests that bottlenose dolphins can answer unexpected questions after encoding information that was seemingly unimportant when it was encountered. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma gondii constitutes a major zoonotic agent but also has been frequently identified as an important cause of clinical disease (e.g., abortion, pneumonia, encephalitis) in wildlife; specifically, T. gondii has been associated with neurological disease in cetaceans. This study investigated the genetic diversity of T. gondii strains involved in infections in dolphins found stranded in the Mediterranean coastlines of Italy. Tissue samples from 16 dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba and Tursiops truncatus species) positive for T. gondii-DNA presence by PCR were examined by histology and subjected to further genetic characterization of strains detected by PCR-RFLP and multilocus PCR-sequencing assays. According to fully genotyped samples, the genotypes ToxoDB#3 (67%) and #2 (22%) were detected, the latter being reported for the first time in cetaceans, along with a mixed infection (11%). Subtyping by PCR-seq procedures provided evidence of common point mutations in strains from southwestern Europe. Despite evidence of T. gondii as a cause of neurological disease in dolphins, sources of infections are difficult to identify since they are long-living animals and some species have vast migration areas with multiple chances of infection. Finally, the genetic diversity of T. gondii found in the dolphins studied in the Mediterranean coastlines of Italy reflects the main genotypes circulating inland in the European continent. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: To histologically evaluate the gastric compartments of Risso’s (Grampus griseus) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and provide suggestions for the diet of Risso’s dolphins in captivity, we examined 12 stomachs from both species. While slight differences in keratinization were observed in the forestomach, significant differences came to light in the second stomach’s mucosa. At this level, in Risso’s dolphin, the principal cells are markedly reduced in size and located externally to the parietal cells, not interspersed between them, compared to bottlenose dolphins; differences were also observed in the structure and concentration of the parietal and principal cells of the gastric body glands (p < 0.0001). The quantitative results of G- and D-cell counts in the gastric mucosa show a clear difference, with a higher concentration of G cells in the mucosa of Risso’s dolphin (t = 7.334; p < 0.0001) and a higher level of D cells in bottlenose dolphin mucosa (t = 3.123; p = 0.0049). These results suggest that parietal cells undergo greater stimulation by gastrin produced by G cells, with greater acid secretion in G. griseus. Further studies are needed to understand whether an inappropriate diet could lead to severe clinical signs due to gastric acidity in Risso’s dolphin. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Bisphenol analogues (BPs) are ubiquitous pollutants to marine organisms as endocrine disruptive chemicals. However, the residue contamination and the trophic transfer of BPs in the apex predator nearshore dolphins are poorly studied. Here, we measured the concentrations of six BPs, including bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol P (BPP), and bisphenol S (BPS) in the liver of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) (n = 75) collected from the Pearl River Estuary during a period with significant dietary changes (2004-2020). BPA and BPAF were the dominant components of the residue ςBPs in the liver, with a proportion of 80%. Sex, maturity, and stranding location had no significant effects on BP levels. The generalized additive models indicated that BPA levels in juveniles and adults decreased from 2004 to 2013 while increasing from 2013 to 2020. The temporal trend of BPA levels was likely driven by the shift of the dominant diet from Harpadon nehereus to Thryssa spp. The concurrent increase of BPA loads in calves and juveniles and adults over the recent decades suggested that the diet-mediated variations of maternal BPA levels could be redistributed to their offspring.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Human activity affects marine mammal stranding rates in two major ways; through human interaction (HI) that may lead to mortality and through search and response efforts that enable carcass detection. To better quantify the combined effects of these interacting human influences, we analyzed strandings for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), an area of high cetacean strandings. To identify hotspots of human influence, we first determined the number of total and HI-related bottlenose dolphin strandings normalized to shoreline length in each nGOM U.S. state, which represent major response areas. To estimate the effects of response effort on stranding numbers (for HI and non-HI strandings), we used the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWHOS) as an established benchmark to compare periods of lower (pre-spill) and higher (post-spill) response effort. Strandings in Alabama waters were used as a case study to detail spatial and temporal variation due to human influences during the 39-year period of retrospective study. We found an increase in strandings from Louisiana through Alabama following the DWHOS. Non-oil related HI strandings increased in total number in AL, and they increased as a proportion of total strandings in Alabama (16%) and the Florida panhandle (12%). The increase in HI-related strandings in Alabama was driven by mortality of many types, but particularly fishery interactions and cases of apparent intentional harm. The Alabama case study clearly detected lower stranding numbers during periods of low or intermittent response coverage. Our findings are consistent with an overall increase in stranding numbers due to a combination of increased stranding occurrence and response effort following the DWHOS. Importantly, we provide evidence that HI-related standings increased independently from the DWHOS, with ongoing increases in at least one hotspot (Alabama). These findings provide a first step to parsing out different effects of human influences on stranding data for a common coastal cetacean. Our approach establishes baselines for future damage and recovery assessments, identifies areas where resources can be focused for management and education, and highlights the power of response and monitoring agencies to positively influence stranding datasets.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) around Mikura Island are important both commercially (swim-with-dolphin programs) and scientifically (long-term underwater behavioral studies). However, this population experienced a substantial population decline (31% of identified dolphins) between 2008 and 2011, which prompted us to monitor population health using body length. A decrease in the growth rate of neonates and calves is a warning sign of unhealthy conditions in the population. This study examined the total length of free-ranging Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins off Mikura Island, using a low-cost commercially available 3D underwater camera system. Length-at-age data from 129 measurements of 108 identified dolphins were successfully obtained and were best described by the Richards growth model compared to the Gompertz and von Bertalanffy models. Body length did not differ significantly between females and males, with an estimated population asymptotic length of 246.9 cm (95% confidence interval: 241.7–252.7 cm). Calves were approximately 100 cm in length at birth and reached 178.2 cm at 1 year of age and 208.6 cm at 3 years when many calves became independent from their mothers. Length-at-age estimates of the Mikura Island population are similar to and greater than those reported in southwestern Australia and Shark Bay, respectively. Our simple non-invasive underwater technique demonstrated to be effective in quantifying the growth pattern in a free-ranging dolphin population without using dead or stranded specimens, which provides essential information for monitoring of dolphin populations and sustainable swim-with-dolphin programs. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: Striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) is the most abundant cetacean species in the western Mediterranean Sea. Coastal populations are locally exposed to intense recreational boating, a growing activity over the last thirty years. Dedicated boat surveys carried out since 1988 (13,896 km of effort), enabled to map relative abundance for two periods, 1988–2003 and 2004–2019, which evidenced a significant decrease of habitat use in the inshore part of study area. Coastal traffic was surveyed from a shore lookout located in Cap d'Antibes (French Riviera) during 47 daily sessions from May 2017 to April 2018: traffic flow often exceeded one boat per minute in summer, with a majority of motorboats. Underwater recordings showed that inshore noise was about 10 dB higher than in the open sea, with much energy being propagated by fast boats, including in the medium to high frequency domain. Ambient noise data collected during spring 2020 lockdown evidenced a clear noise level decrease compared to normal situations. Although other stressors may not be neglected, this study suggested that intense motorboat traffic is a likely contributor to the observed striped dolphin partial habitat loss. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Lipidomics represent a valid complementary tool to the biochemical analysis of plasma in humans. However, in cetaceans, these tools have been unexplored. Here, we evaluated how the plasma lipid composition of Tursiops truncatus is modulated by developmental stage and sex, aiming at a potential use of lipidomics in integrated strategies to monitor cetacean health. We characterized the fatty acid profile and detected a total of 26 fatty acids in T. truncatus plasma. The most abundant fatty acids were palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1n-9). Interestingly, there are consistent differences between the fatty acid profile of mature female and mature male specimens. Phospholipidome analysis identified 320 different lipid species belonging to phosphatidylcholine (PC, 105 lipid species), lysophosphatidylcholine (42), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 67), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (18), phosphatidylglycerol (14), lysophosphatidylglycerol (8), phosphatidylinositol (14), lysophosphatidylinositol (2), phosphatidylserine (3), sphingomyelin (45) and ceramides (2) classes. The statistical analysis of the phospholipidome showed that its composition allows discriminating mature animals between sexes and mature males from immature males. Notably, discrimination between sexes is mainly determined by the contents of PE plasmalogens and lysophospholipids (LPC and LPE), while the differences between mature and immature male animals were mainly determined by the levels of PC lipids. This is the first time that a correlation between developmental stage and sex and the lipid composition of the plasma has been established in cetaceans. Being able to discern between age and sex-related changes is an encouraging step towards using these tools to also detect differences related to disease/dysfunction processes. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean poxviruses (CePVs) cause ‘tattoo’ skin lesions in small and large cetaceans worldwide. Although the disease has been known for decades, genomic data for these poxviruses are very limited, with the exception of CePV-Tursiops aduncus, which was completely sequenced in 2020. Using a newly developed pan-pox real-time PCR system targeting a conserved nucleotide sequence located within the Monkeypox virus D6R gene, we rapidly detected the CePV genome in typical skin lesions collected from two Peruvian common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) by-caught off Peru in 1993. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequencing of the DNA polymerase and DNA topoisomerase genes showed that the two viruses are very closely related to each other, although the dolphins they infected pertained to different ecotypes. The poxviruses described in this study belong to CePV-1, a heterogeneous clade that infects many species of dolphins (Delphinidae) and porpoises (Phocoenidae). Among this clade, the T. truncatus CePVs from Peru were more related to the viruses infecting Delphinidae than to those detected in Phocoenidae. This is the first time that CePVs were identified in free-ranging odontocetes from the Eastern Pacific, surprisingly in 30-year-old samples. These data further suggest a close and long-standing pathogen–host co-evolution, resulting in different lineages of CePVs. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Study of animal communication and its potential social role implies associating signals to an emitter. This has been a major limitation in the study of cetacean communication as they produce sounds underwater with no distinctive behavioral signs. Different techniques have been used to identify callers, but all proved to have ethical or practical limitations. Bio-logging technology has recently provided new hopes, but tags developed so far are costly and do not allow sufficiently reliable discrimination between calls made by the tagged individual and those made by the surrounding individuals. We propose a new device developed at reasonable cost while providing reliable recordings. We tested caller identification through recordings of vocal production of a group of captive bottlenose dolphins under controlled and spontaneous contexts. Our device proved to identify callers through visual examination of sonograms and quantitative measures of amplitudes, even if tagged emitters are 0.4 m apart (regardless of body orientations). Although this device is not able to identify emitters in an entire group when all individuals are not equipped, it enables efficient exclusion of individuals who were not the caller, suggesting that identification of a caller would be reliable if all the individuals were equipped. This is to our knowledge the first description of a promising low-cost safe recording device allowing individual identification of emitters for captive dolphins. With some improvements, this device could become an interesting tool to increase our knowledge of dolphin acoustic communication.

ABSTRACT: Common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean are subject to incidental mortality in fishing gear. However, no information on trends in abundance or estimates of bycatch mortality are available to evaluate the impact of this threat on the population. This study presents estimates of life history parameters using postmortem data obtained over a 17-year period in Argentina. Ages were determined for 93 specimens, and reproductive organ samples were examined (n = 89). Immature animals ranged from 0 to 6 years in females and from 0 to 9 years in males. Mature animals ranged from 7 to 21 years in females and from 6 to 23 years in males. The asymptotic body length (L∞) described by a Gompertz model fit to age-length data was 196 cm, 95% CI [192.45, 199.76] for females and 210.75 cm, 95% CI [206.64, 215.30] for males and was attained at 14 years in females and 15 years in males. Comparison to other populations showed that L∞ were shorter than estimates from New Zealand, similar to L∞ from eastern North Atlantic, and longer than estimates from North Pacific common dolphins. Lmax reported here were shorter than New Zealand ones but similar to those previously reported from other populations. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Background and Aim: The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus, and the pantropical spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuata, are protected marine mammals in Thailand; however, knowledge regarding the populations of both species in Thai seas is minimal. We aimed to reveal the genetic diversity and population structure of two species, T. aduncus, and S. attenuata, based on inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs). Materials and Methods: Samples of stranded T. aduncus (n = 30) and S. attenuata (n = 23) found along Thai Andaman Sea coasts from 1998 to 2018 were used in this study. A total of 17 and 16 ISSR primers that produced clear and polymorphic bands were selected for T. aduncus and S. attenuata, respectively. Results: The highest percentages of polymorphic bands for T. aduncus and S. attenuata were 93.750% and 92.857%, respectively. Phylogenetic dendrograms indicated that the population of each species was clustered into three groups. This outcome was consistent with the genetic population structure, as both suggested three genetic clusters (ΔK = 3). Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the average Shannon’s information index (I) was 1.926 ± 0.066 for T. aduncus and 1.714 ± 0.090 for S. attenuata, which indicate a high level of genetic variation. Further, low fixation index (F) values were observed for T. aduncus and S. attenuata at −0.231 ± 0.024 and −0.312 ± 0.042, respectively, suggesting that inbreeding is unlikely to have occurred for both species over the past decades. Conclusion: At least three genetic clusters of both species were found in the Thai Andaman Sea, and the diversity indices of each species indicated that these species are not at a critical level for extinction. However, monitoring their population status should be prioritized to observe any future changes in the level of diversity. Copyright: Piboon, et al.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins perform flipper rubbing in which they rub their partners with their pectoral fins. Considered similar to social grooming in primates, which have social and hygienic functions, flipper rubbing has been suggested to possess certain social functions. However, there are no reports based on quantitative data to support a hygienic function of this behavior. In this study, flipper rubbing and self-rubbing were observed in a group of three captive mother–calf dolphin pairs. In 19.2% of the observed 806 flipper-to-body rubbings and 54% of the 276 self-rubbings, dead skin was shed from the rubbed body part. There was a significant negative correlation between the number of flipper-to-body rubbing episodes the subjects received and their performance of self-rubbing. These results suggest that a function of flipper rubbing is to maintain and care for the body surface. In all mother–calf pairs, the mother rubbed her calf significantly more often than the calf rubbed the mother. Furthermore, each mother became a rubber significantly more often when their own offspring was their rubbing partner than when the partner was any other individual. These findings suggest that flipper rubbing is a mother-to-calf caring behavior. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Ethological Society.

ABSTRACT: Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) have a global tropical and subtropical distribution with oceanic, neritic, and island-associated populations. To inform conservation and management for this species, we used sequences from the mtDNA control region (n = 360), mitogenomes (n = 19), and six nuclear introns (n = 35) to provide multiple lines of evidence to critically evaluate the potential taxonomic status of rough-toothed dolphins. Using samples from the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, we examined the null hypothesis that rough-toothed dolphins are one panmictic species and the alternate hypothesis of oceanic subspecies. Phylogenetic analyses of mitogenomes revealed a private Atlantic clade sister to a larger cosmopolitan clade including individuals from all tropical and subtropical oceans. We dated the split between the Atlantic clade and the cosmopolitan clade to 890,000 years ago. We determined that Atlantic rough-toothed dolphins could be correctly diagnosed with 98% accuracy with the mtDNA control region and calculated the net nucleotide divergence as 0.02. Population level analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation using mtDNA among most regions, while significant differentiation using nuclear markers occurred only between the Atlantic and the Indian/Pacific regions. Therefore, the oceanic divergence and diagnosability of rough-toothed dolphins in the Atlantic and the Indian/Pacific Oceans meet proposed criteria for recognition as two subspecies. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: With the dramatic increase in anthropogenic threats to the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), the population size of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) has significantly decreased over the past decade. To understand the impact and potential risks of intense human activities on these dolphins, factors related to the mortality of humpback dolphins in the PRE were investigated by a detailed examination of 343 dolphin specimens stranded during 2003–2017. There was a significant (p < 0.01) increasing trend for humpback dolphin stranding, reflecting the accelerating rate of the population decline. A large proportion of strandings (35.88%) were neonates. A low recruitment rate implies slow population growth, and hence, limited capacity to resist anthropogenic stress. The most commonly diagnosed causes of death were vessel collision and net entanglement. The concentrations of trace metals, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and most of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the dolphin samples were greater than those previously reported in cetaceans globally. Furthermore, Cu, PCB77, PCB169, PCB81, PCB37, and PFASs (excluding PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHxDA, and PFODA) were the major pollutants accumulated in neonates. 67% of PCB, 78% of Cu, and 100% of perfluorooctane sulfonate concentrations in the neonates exceeded the threshold for toxicological effects in marine mammals, suggesting that these compounds could be important factors contributing to the low survival rate of calves in this area. This study revealed that vessel transportation, fishing activities, and pollutant bioaccumulation are the three major causes of humpback dolphin mortality in the PRE. These results highlight the need for more efforts to restrict anthropogenic activities, especially vessel traffic, the catching of these marine animals and fishing, and pollutant discharge, in order to prevent vulnerable species from continuous population decline and further extinction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Marine mammals, as top predators, are constantly exposed to several PFAS compounds that accumulate in different tissues. As a proxy to assess cytotoxicity of PFAS in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), we generated a new immortalized cell line derived from skin samples of bottlenose dolphin. Using high content imaging, we assessed the effects of increasing concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, PFBS, PFBA and C6O4 on cell viability and cell cycle phases. In particular, we classified all cells based on multiple morphometric differences of the nucleus in three populations, named respectively “Normal” (nuclei in G0, S and M phase); “Large” (nuclei showing characteristics of senescence) and “Small” (nuclei with fragmentation and condensed chromatin). Combining this approach with cell cycle analysis we determined which phases of the cell cycle were influenced by PFAS. The results revealed that the presence of PFOS, PFBS and PFBA could increase the number of cells in G0+G1 phase and decrease the number of those in the S phase. Moreover, PFOS and PFBS lowered the fraction of cells in the M phase. Interestingly PFOS, PFBS and PFBA reduced the prevalence of the senescence phenotype (“large” nuclei), suggesting a potential tumorigenic effect. Besides, the presence of PFOS and PFBS correlated also with a significant decrease in the number of “small” nuclei. The C6O4 exposure did not highlighted morphometric alteration or cell cycle modification bottlenose dolphin skin cell nuclei. While the effects of PFAS on cell cycle was clear, no significant change was detected either in term of cell proliferation or of viability. This study fosters the overall knowledge on the cellular effects of perfluoroalkyl substances in marine mammals. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Pontoporia blainvillei (Gervais & d’Orbigny, 1844), the franciscana dolphin, is the most endangered small cetacean in the Western South Atlantic. It is an endemic species with a coastal and estuarine distribution that has been divided into four Franciscana Management Areas (FMAs). We used the mitochondrial DNA control region to conduct a phylogeographic analysis to evaluate the population structure of the franciscana and the influence of paleoceanographic events on its biogeographic history. We found nine populations along the entire distribution (ΦST = 0.41, ΦCT = 0.38, p < 10–5), with estimated migration rates resulting in less than one female per generation. Populations from FMAIII and FMAIV in the south (including the Río de La Plata Estuary) showed higher long-term migration rates and effective population sizes than northern populations. The phylogeographic analysis supports the franciscana origin in the Río de La Plata Estuary, with further dispersal south and northwards. The first lineage split happened around 2.5 Ma, with lineage radiation throughout the Pleistocene until recent fragmentation events shaped current-day populations. We suggest that Pleistocene glaciations influenced the dispersion and population structure of the franciscana. Specifically, that the shift of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence drove the dispersion northwards. Then, low sea-level periods caused either the isolation in estuarine refugia or local extinctions, followed by re-colonizations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A computational model is developed to investigate the jump of a self-propelled dolphin out of water. This model relies on the Navier-Stokes equations, where a fictitious domain approach with the volume penalization method is used for fluid-structure coupling, and the continuous surface force approach is used to model the water-air interface, the latter being tracked in a level-set framework. The dolphin's geometry is based on freely available data from the literature. While body deformation is imposed, the leading linear and angular displacements are computed from Newton’s laws. Numerical simulations show that it is necessary to generate large propulsives forces to allow the jump out of water. When the dolphin is out of water, its trajectory follows a purely ballistic one. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Delphinids are top ocean predators and accumulate high concentrations of mercury (Hg) through the food chain, particularly in organs such as liver and kidney, although the proportion of methylmercury (MeHg) is relatively low due to the demethylation process. Total mercury (T-Hg) levels in marine mammals have been shown to correlate with selenium (Se) concentrations, and ingested MeHg that is demethylated may be present in tissues as mercury selenide (HgSe). In this study, we determined T-Hg, MeHg and Se concentrations of three Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), and we used the individual with the highest Hg concentration for electron probe microanalysis to assess the co-localization of Hg and Se in the tissues. By electron probe microanalysis, we found that Hg and Se were co-localized in large granules in hepatic Kupffer cells and in small granules in hepatocytes. The analysis suggested that MeHg was demethylated in hepatocytes and then phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. In the kidney, Hg and Se were co-localized in the glomerular capillary wall and in interstitial blood vessel walls. Hg and Se were also co-localized in the cytoplasm of large neurons and in glial cells in the cerebrum. Divalent Hg and HgSe cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, suggesting that MeHg is demethylated in the dolphin brain and that binding to Se suppresses Hg toxicity. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Top marine predators present high mercury concentrations in their tissues due to biomagnification in the marine food chain. This study reports mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) status, and the Hg:Se molar ratio assessment in bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus), striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus). Total Hg and Se concentrations were determined in muscle, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, adipose tissue and skin collected from 186 specimens stranded in the Croatian part of Adriatic Sea from 1995 to 2014. Total Hg concentrations in tissue samples ranged from 0.001 in the spleen to 2238 mg/kg wet weight in liver. Se concentrations in dolphin samples ranged from 0.010 to 2916 mg/kg ww. Minimum Se concentration was found in muscle and maximum Se concentration were found in liver of bottlenose dolphin. Hg and Se levels in Risso's dolphins showed higher concentrations in all tissues in comparison to bottlenose and striped dolphins. Significant and positive correlations were observed between age and Hg concentrations (P < 0.05). In 66.6 % of Risso's, 15.3 % of bottlenose dolphins and one stranded striped dolphin in this study, the hepatic concentration of Hg exceeded the higher toxic thresholds (400 mg/kg w.w.) previously defined as evidence of liver damage in marine mammals. The Hg:Se molar ratio in the liver of Risso's dolphin was 0.670. The liver of adult bottlenose dolphins showed expected values (0.870), while the liver of young dolphins had a high ratio (0.750), non-specific for the age group. The Hg:Se molar ratio in the liver of striped dolphins was 0.390, which is lower than the literature values. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus), uncommon prior to the 1970’s, are now regularly observed within the Southern California Bight. During long-term cetacean monitoring programs on United States Navy range areas in the Southern California Bight from 2009–2019, we deployed 16 Argos-linked satellite tags on Risso’s to acquire objective, detailed depictions of their movements and behaviors. Individuals were tracked for a median of 10.7 days (range = 0.8 – 19.7). Kernel density estimation suggested individuals utilized the entire Southern California Bight with the 50% core use area centered around San Clemente and Santa Catalina Islands where most of the tag deployments occurred. Grand median dive depth was 101 m (max = 528) and dive duration was 5.6 min (max = 11.1). We used generalized mixed models to assess seasonal and environmental effects on distribution and diving behavior including month, distance to shore, time of day, lunar phase, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a residuals. Animals were further from shore (including islands) during a full versus new moon and from the mainland during the last versus first quarter moon. Animals also tended to be closer to land in the fall and early winter months. Dives were deeper yet shorter during the night, during a full moon, and when animals were further offshore. Animals conducted nearly twice as many dives at night compared to day, though deep dives (> 500 m) occurred at all times of day. This study provides insights into Risso’s distribution and behavioral trends while identifying priorities for future research. Copyright © 2022 Rone, Sweeney, Falcone, Watwood and Schorr.

ABSTRACT: Marine plastic pollution is one of the most concerning worldwide environmental issues, and research is day by day demonstrating its adverse effects on marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, little is still known about the toxic potential on marine fauna of chemical additives released by plastic debris. Here we investigated the cyto- and genotoxicity of the most used plasticizer in plastic production, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), on a skin cell line (TT) derived from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), a species particularly exposed to the accumulation of this lipophilic pollutant, being a coastal top predator rich in fatty subcutaneous tissues. Dolphin cell cultures were exposed to increasing DEHP doses (0.01–5 mM) to evaluate effects on cell viability, cell death, and induction of DNA damage. On the hypothesis that bottlenose dolphin cells show greater resistance to DEHP toxicity than terrestrial mammals, as already shown for other pollutants, the same parameters were analyzed on exposed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Both MTT and Trypan Blue assays showed no significant decrease in dolphin’s cell viability after 24-h DEHP exposure. No induction of primary DNA damage was detected by the comet assay, whereas the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay revealed significant micronuclei induction and inhibition of cell proliferation starting from the lowest DEHP doses. DEHP had similar but sharper and significant effects on cell viability in CHO cells, also causing a much greater induction of necrosis than that recorded on dolphin cells. For both cell lines, the lack of induction of primary DNA damage (i.e., strand breaks) together with the increase of micronuclei yield after DEHP treatment suggests an aneugenic effect of the phthalate, that is, the loss of entire chromosomes during cell division. Overall, the potential chromosome loss detected could constitute a threat for species of marine mammals constantly exposed to plastic marine litter.

ABSTRACT: Globally, the river ecosystems are threatened due to human-driven exploitation and indiscriminate resource use. The rate of species loss is a magnitude higher in these ecosystems, hence, identifying conservation priority areas as refugia, using the flagship-cum-indicator species approach can aid in long-term conservation of multiple species and ensure uninterrupted functioning of ecological processes. For effective conservation planning, we derived the site occupancy and abundance of Gangetic dolphin (Platanista gangetica) as a flagship species in the Ganga River Basin, and modelled their distribution vis-à-vis river conditions for identifying Conservation Priority Stretches (CPS). The study incorporates the first-ever basin-wide (4635 km river) Gangetic dolphin (GD) sightings to estimate range decline, abundance, and identify CPS of select rivers in the Basin. A total of 2151 sightings of surfacing dolphins with mean encounter rate of 0.55 ± 0.09 sightings/km of the river was observed from the surveyed stretch. The GD encounter rate varied significantly across the surveyed rivers (Analysis of Variance, F = 3.08, p < 0.001). We estimated 24.37 % decline in the dolphin distribution range in the basin since 19th Century. The estimated population size of the dolphin in the Basin was 3330 individuals ± 620 individuals (Confidence Interval 95 % = 2304–4668; Coefficient of Variance = 18.61) which varied across the river. The site occupancy and abundance were best predicted by channel depth (β = 0.82 ± 0.46), meanders (β = 02.56 ± 0.87) and individual rivers, whereas channel width (β = 0.11 ± 0.08) and survey efforts influenced detection probabilities. Further, we identified 610 km (12.2 %) of river stretches as high CPS in the Basin based on the prediction probability (≥0.70) of GD. Protection of these stretches is likely to ensure sustained reproduction of GD and provide refugia for other threatened species of the Ganga River and its tributaries, which is under increasing anthropogenic pressure. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Increasing depletion of fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea intensifies conflicts between fisheries and marine mammals, such as the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821). To increase the knowledge of such interactions in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, fishing activities of commercial fisheries and biomass of fish families targeted by fisheries and T. truncatus were analysed to identify areas that are more likely to be affected by these conflicts in the Dodecanese region of Greece. The area with the highest risk of conflict is located between Kos and Leros islands and the southwest coast of Turkey, which is mainly caused by trawl fishing activities. The presence of Sparidae, Merlucciidae, Mullidae and other unspecified fish families increased the likelihood of conflicts. Our applied method and results can be used to improve fishing regulations and management to diminish similar conflicts elsewhere in the world. © 2022 Archipelagos - Institute of Marine Conservation.

ABSTRACT: Blubber is a highly specialized and dynamic tissue unique to marine mammals and presents a reflection of the individuals' nutrition, environment, and life history traits. Few studies have investigated the histomorphology of cetacean blubber in subtropical environments. The aim of this study was to investigate the blubber histomorphology of three different dolphin species off the subtropical KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa, using adipocyte cell size, number, and density. Blubber tissue samples from the saddle area of 43 incidentally bycaught animals (four Sousa plumbea, 36 Tursiops aduncus, and three Delphinus delphis) were used to compare cell parameters between blubber layers. Samples were divided into the upper third (corresponding to the superficial layer closest to the epidermis), middle third, and lower third (corresponding to the deep layer). For T. aduncus, factors potentially affecting blubber histomorphology, such as sex, age class, and season, were also assessed. Our results showed that no stratification was present in S. plumbea, which could be ascribed to the species' warmer inshore habitat, large body size, and apparent lower mobility. For T. aduncus and D. capensis, however, blubber stratification was determined, characterized by a gradual transition of cell size, number, and density between layers rather than clearly defined layers. Significant differences in adipocyte cell number and density were found for different sexes and age classes of T. aduncus. However, there were no significant differences between seasons, which was attributed to the small temperature differences between seasons. This study represents the first investigation of odontocete blubber histomorphology in subtropical waters. It is recommended that future studies investigate blubber lipid content, while also taking into consideration the reproductive status of the females and the temperature range of their study area. It is hoped that our results, in conjunction with histopathology and other health indicators, could assist in assessing health and body condition. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: For both the expansion of important islands/reefs and the development of marine resources in South China Sea, a modular integrated floating structure (MIFS) system with tidal self-adaptation dolphin-fender mooring (DFM) has been proposed. The DFM, coupled with wave energy converters (WEC), can serve as an anti-motion system. Considering both the modules’ hydrodynamic interaction effect and the connectors’ mechanical coupling effect, both dynamic responses of the MIFS system and the WEC’s output power characteristics were investigated under typical sea conditions. Based on the comprehensive consideration of key factors (safety, economy, and comfort), the effects of both the DFM and module connectors were systematically studied for the MIFS system. Preliminarily optimal design parameters of corresponding connectors and WECs were suggested. The security of the MIFS system under extreme sea conditions was checked, and a promising survival strategy has been proposed. In addition, the modular expansion scheme of the MIFS system was further discussed, and the results indicated that the proposed MIFS system shows good expansibility. The WEC can not only improve both dynamic responses and the comfort of inner modules, but also make considerable wave energy contributions. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the processes that determine the occurrence of species, especially for those exposed to human activities, is key to appropriate management. The common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, is well studied worldwide, but very little attention has been given to transient groups of this species and how such groups are exposed to human activities. Here, we modeled and mapped how the environment and human activities drives bottlenose dolphin habitat suitability, and residence patterns in an anthropized area of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. To predict habitat suitability, we ran 300 distribution models, including six algorithms, and generated an ensemble model. In parallel, we used photo-identification techniques to investigate dolphins' residence patterns. Our results demonstrated that primary productivity, seabed slope and port activities explained dolphins’ habitat suitability. The most suitable areas included coastal waters, nearby port complexes and shipping routes. We also identified a low degree of residence in Cabo Frio and Rio de Janeiro city waters, but calves were constantly sighted there, indicating an important area for caring and nursing. The high overlap between the dolphins’ most suitable areas and human activities, such as ports, vessel traffic and fisheries spots, plus the presence of calves in these areas, highlights the need for safeguard measurements to protect these animals from anthropogenic threats. Our results can be used to support management decisions, such as fisheries regulations and the creation of new marine protected areas to conserve critical habitats for this species. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The oceans contain trillions of plastic particles, mostly microplastics (i.e., particles < 5 mm diameter; 92.4% of plastic particles), which have been detected in organisms at all levels of the marine food web. The ubiquity of marine plastic debris has created a monumental environmental pollution problem with extensive public health consequences, as more than 40% of the world’s population lives near the coast and shares coastal resources. For decades, common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have been used as sentinels of marine pollution risks for coastal communities that rely on seafood. Recently, prevalent phthalate exposure was documented in bottlenose dolphins residing in Sarasota Bay, FL, at concentrations exceeding those of human reference populations. While the source of their exposure is uncertain, the types of compounds detected suggest a plastic origin. The objective of this study was to screen for plastic ingestion among free-ranging dolphins in Sarasota Bay using gastric samples collected during catch-and-release health assessments. Gastric samples were collected from seven live bottlenose dolphins in 2019, and suspected microplastic particles were detected in all samples. The number of particles per sample ranged from <10 to >100, and the most common types were transparent films and white foams. Similar to other marine mammal studies, fibers were also present. Given that dolphins are likely exposed to microplastics via contaminated prey, findings from this and additional studies will help to evaluate the potential of contaminated seafood as an additional source of microplastic exposure for humans, as well as help to inform intervention and risk communication needs regarding seafood safety.

ABSTRACT: A fundamental question in animal behaviour is the role of vocal communication in the regulation of social interactions in species that organise themselves into social groups. Context dependence and seasonality in vocalizations are present in the communication of many species, although very little research has addressed this dependence in marine mammals. The study presented here examined variations in the rate at which free-ranging dyads of bottlenose dolphins emit social-signals in an effort to better understand the relationship between vocal communication and social context. The results demonstrate that changes in the social-signal production in bottlenose dolphins are related to the sex of the partner, mating season and social affiliation between the components of the dyad. In a context of foraging behaviour on the same feeding ground, mixed (male–female) dyads were found to emit more pulsed burst sounds during the mating season. Another relevant aspect of the study seems to be the greater production of agonistic social-signals in the dyads formed by individuals with a lower degree of social affiliation. Overall, this study confirms a clear relationship between dyad composition and context-specific social-signals that could reflect the motivational state of individuals linked to seasonal changes in vocal behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Epidermal conditions, traumatic marks, deformities, and unusual body pigmentation were visually assessed on common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) using photo-identification and sightings data collected between 2007 and 2018 in Welsh waters. The goals of this study were to describe and categorize external body conditions, in particular, analyse the influence of age, sex, and distribution patterns on the mark prevalence, and assess the temporal and spatial patterns of lesions over time. During 222 boat-based trips, 287 individual dolphins were identified and almost all (99.3%) had skin marks, with individuals carrying between 1 and 12 different types. Linear, conspecific tooth-rake, dark fringe and abraded fin tip were the most prevalent mark types. The investigation of the influence of age, sex, and distribution patterns on skin lesion prevalence showed that adults had significantly higher prevalence compared to calves (t75 = 3.6, p = 0.001, μA = 3.9, μC+J = 2.6), males compared to females (t64 = 2.3, p = 0.03, μF = 4.4, μM = 5.6), whilst “transients” had a significantly higher number of different marks (t31 = 3.3, p = 0.001, “residents” = 3.6; “transients” = 5.9) compared to “residents” within the study area. Eighteen mark types were re-sighted over time. Despite a number of limitations which need to be taken into account, the minimum skin mark prevalence estimates produced in this study provide insights into the health status of common bottlenose dolphins and key evidence on local antagonistic, anthropogenic, infectious and parasitic pressures informing the conservation of this species in Welsh waters. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: Erysipelas is a zoonotic disease caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. In cetaceans, this disease has two main clinical forms: a cutaneous one, grossly characterized by rhomboid lesions, and a septicemic and often fatal form. Erysipelas is considered an important cause of morbidity and mortality in captive cetaceans; however, information in free-ranging cetaceans is limited. An adult common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was found dead and in advanced autolysis in Paraíba state, northeastern Brazil, on July 19th, 2020. Upon gross examination, 80% of the body surface presented disseminated rhomboid cutaneous lesions ranging from 4 to 6 cm-width, characterized by well-defined edges and occasional ulceration, consistent with erysipelas. Additionally, anthropic-made postmortem linear cuts and partial mechanical removal of the flank musculature were noted. Skin samples were collected for histopathologic and molecular analyses. Microscopically, it was possible to observe multifocal dermatitis with vasculitis. Erysipelothrix sp. was detected by PCR. Despite previous reports of human consumption of cetacean meat in northeastern Brazil, the observed marks and advanced carcass autolysis suggested that the animal was most likely used as bait for fishing instead of human intake. This case highlights the value of postmortem examination and PCR even in poorly preserved cadavers and contributes to the understanding of the epidemiology of cutaneous erysipelas in free-ranging cetaceans (first report in an odontocete from the Southern Hemisphere). Due to the zoonotic potential of certain Erysipelothrix species (i.e., E. rhusiopathiae), active public health policies are required to inform field professionals and the general public about the health threats associated with marine mammal manipulation and consumption. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

ABSTRACT: Episodic memory involves the conscious recollection of personally experienced events, which has often been argued to be a uniquely human ability.1–5 However, evidence for conscious episodic recall in humans is centered around language-based reports. With no agreed upon non-linguistic behavioral makers of consciousness,6 episodic-like memory7 therefore represents the behavioral characteristics of human episodic memory, in the absence of evidence for subjective experience during recall. Here, we provide compelling evidence for episodic-like memory in common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), based on the incidental encoding and unexpected question paradigm.8 This methodology aims to capture the incidental encoding characteristic of human episodic memory, in that when we recall an experience, we remember information that was trivial at the time of encoding, but was encoded automatically.9 We show that dolphins are able to use incidentally encoded spatial (“where”) and social (“who”) information to solve an unexpected memory task, using only a single test trial per test type, which ensured that the dolphins did not have the opportunity to semantically learn “rules” to pass the test. All participating dolphins made correct choices in both the “where” and “who” tests. These results suggest that dolphins are capable of encoding, recalling, and accessing incidental information within remembered events, which is an ability indicative of episodic memory in humans. We argue that the complex socio-ecological background of dolphins may have selected for the ability to recall both spatial and social information in an episodic-like manner. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The Barataria Bay Estuarine System (BBES) Stock of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the northern Gulf of Mexico has been a focus of extensive research as a result of the Barataria Basin, Louisiana being one of the most heavily oiled estuaries following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The goal of this study was to build upon previous research to better understand social and genetic structure of BBES dolphins. Photo-identification data from 2010–2019 were analysed with SOCPROG to identify dolphin social clusters. Genetic analyses were conducted on samples obtained during remote biopsy surveys and health assessments (2010–2018) to assess if identified social clusters were congruent with genetic clustering results, and to evaluate relatedness and gene flow within and between social and genetic clusters. Spatial analyses of the cumulative photo-identification sighting histories from each cluster were also used to determine their geographic range and degree of overlap within the Barataria Basin. Social analyses identified four distinct clusters with some degree of geographic overlap and similar utilization distributions as the three identified genetic clusters. Dolphins in the Barataria Basin were confirmed to be genetically differentiated from those in adjacent coastal waters. In general, genetic analyses differentiate distinct dolphin communities established through long-term (generational) preferential breeding behaviour. In contrast, social associations can be more fluid over the short-term, may change in response to habitat or predator/prey changes, and strong associations can be formed between a mix of related and unrelated individuals. The combination of genetic and social methodologies is valuable for developing a better understanding of complex dolphin social interactions and provides unique insights into dolphin behaviour that can be important for developing effective management strategies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: "Gaze following"—when one individual witnesses another shift its orientation, and then re-orients in the same direction—has been observed in a wide range of species. Related work with dolphins has to date focused on human–dolphin interactions. In this conspecific study, we examined a group of dolphins orienting, in passing, to gateways between their pools, as opportunities for witnesses to demonstrate "gaze following". Seven bottlenose dolphins were synchronously videotaped on six underwater cameras, for 21 h over three days, and the recordings analyzed by trained observers. The identities of all animals present, their partner state, and whether and to what degree they had altered their access to the gate (e.g., from Monocular to Binocular, or Binocular to Visio-Echoic) was recorded. Compared to animals that did not witness such a change, witnesses of an increase in access by another dolphin were significantly more likely to also act to increase their own access. We observed 460 such cases of "gaze following" in these animals. Dolphins who were partnered (showed sustained swimming within 1 body length) were significantly more likely, than non-partnered animals, to "gaze follow". Dolphins also showed a significant tendency toward matching the kind of access they observed. No significant difference was found in the presence of animals in the back pools, during changes in orientation that were followed, versus in those that were not. These findings support adding bottlenose dolphins to the growing list of species that display conspecific "gaze following". © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Mobile predators serve important ecological functions, including acting as nutrient vectors between different ecosystems. In coral reefs, pelagic nutrient subsidies are believed to play an increasingly important role under ongoing and projected environmental changes. Here, we combine visual sightings with passive acoustic monitoring to report habitat use and behaviour by cetaceans within atoll lagoons in the Maldives and Chagos archipelagoes. We demonstrate that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are the most widely distributed and numerically abundant cetacean inside these atolls (>90% of all individual cetaceans by numbers). Our visual and acoustic observations both provide evidence of a regular diurnal behaviour, where dolphins enter the lagoons during the morning, for day-time resting, and exit during the afternoon, for night-time foraging offshore. Using standard metabolic models and timing of lagoonal residencies, we estimate that a dolphin pod would deposit approximately 288 ± 17 kg year−1 of nitrogen of primarily mesopelagic origin inside the lagoons. The nitrogen deposited inside an atoll lagoon by a dolphin pod resident year-round will therefore likely enhance coral reef productivity and resilience and suggests that these dolphins play a role in making pelagic energy and nutrients available to coral reefs. The absence of any acoustic detections following the reversal of the monsoon winds suggests that the short-to-medium-term residency of the dolphins is sensitive to seasonal productivity dynamics. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: There is limited information on Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) in the Bay of Brunei, Brunei Darussalam. This research was carried out from 2016 to 2018 to determine the water surface behaviour of Irrawaddy dolphins in the bay, the relationship between behaviour and abiotic factors and the number of individuals displaying the behaviour. Behavioural categories, i.e., feeding, socializing, and travelling in groups or individually, and water parameters were documented during boat-based line transect surveys. “Feeding” (n = 188) behaviour was the dominant activity exhibited by the dolphins. The chi-square test (χ2) shows that the frequency of feeding, socializing, and travelling to the water depth range is significantly high (p-value = 0.03). Forty-six percent (46%) of all behavioural categories occurred at depths 1.00–5.99 m. The number of individuals displaying “feeding” behaviour has a weak positive relationship with depth (p-value = 0.07), turbidity (p-value = 0.7), sea surface temperature (p-value = 0.9) and salinity (p-value = 0.9). This study may serve as a baseline for future research. It can help in planning conservation projects and management for Irrawaddy dolphins in the Bay of Brunei, Brunei Darussalam. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Coastal cetaceans are recognized as ecologically important species and have been the target for environmental monitoring programs and conservation strategies. Although supervised models have increasingly been used to better monitor complexity relationships between cetaceans and their habitats, the development of unsupervised learning techniques that have significant advantages in visualizing, grouping and reducing the dimensionality of data has been overlooked. Here, using the unsupervised artificial neural network of self-organizing map (SOM), we examined the intraspecific variation of habitat utilization among three geographically neighboring populations (waters southwest of Hainan Island abbreviated as WS Hainan, Sanniang Bay, and Zhanjiang waters) of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in the northern South China Sea. The results showed that the population inhabiting in WS Hainan occupied a largest area with scattered patterns comparing to the other two in Sanniang Bay and Zhanjiang waters. The SOM analysis further showed that the examined populations in different waters have distinct habitat characteristics. S. chinensis in WS Hainan was sighted in deeper water with higher salinity, whereas the population in Sanniang Bay inhabited in estuary with lower pH and salinity. More complicated distributed patterns and environmental heterogeneity were observed in Zhanjiang waters, where the dolphins distributed contractively in a small area at the entrance of Zhanjiang Port and dispersed in another large area in Leizhou Bay. Correspondently, part of the sightings in Zhanjiang waters had similar habitat with those in WS Hainan, while others were reported in more inshore, deeper and muddied waters. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that S. chinensis can be divided into two ecotypes: estuarine and non-estuarine. Here, we confirmed that the SOM can well identify the habitat differentiation in S. chinensis, and therefore suggested it is a powerful modeling tool for cetacean monitoring program. Our findings contribute to a specific habitat conservation strategy that one integrated protected area would be better for S. chinensis in Sanniang Bay and Zhanjiang waters, while several small protected areas with connecting corridors were more suitable for population in WS Hainan. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Quantifying demographic parameters and patterns of social dynamics is fundamental to understanding the population ecology of group-living animals and carries considerable conservation implications. In the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, one of the world’s largest, most urbanised and industrialised estuarine systems located on the southeast coast of China, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins are under a multitude of anthropogenic pressures. While in Hong Kong, at the eastern perimeter of the region, these dolphins have been studied for many years, at the western reaches of the PRD they have received little research and conservation attention. In this study, with the application of mark-recapture and socio-demographic modelling techniques, we quantify population parameters, group dynamics and social structure, establishing socio-demographic baselines for this little known component of the longest-studied population of the genus Sousa. These dolphins live in a fluid fission–fusion society with markedly weak inter-individual affiliations. Individual ranging patterns and spatial preferences (e.g., foraging areas) appear to be among the key factors determining their grouping pattern and socio-spatial structure across the region, with several social clusters which, although discernible, especially at the peripheries of the region, frequently interact socially and overlap spatially. Currently, 914 dolphins inhabit waters of western PRD, but their estimated survival rates are below the previously estimated threshold needed for long-term survival as a viable demographic unit. These findings indicate high levels of environmental stress and raise conservation concerns, especially in the face of manifold and growing anthropogenic pressure. This study calls for comprehensive assessments of cumulative anthropogenic impacts and for a critical revision of present conservation measures. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: Social structuring from assortative associations may affect individual fitness, as well as population-level processes. Gaining a broader understanding of social structure can improve our knowledge of social evolution and inform wildlife conservation. We investigated association patterns and community structure of female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, assessing the role of kinship, shared culturally transmitted foraging techniques, and habitat similarity based on water depth. Our results indicated that associations are influenced by a combination of uni- and biparental relatedness, cultural behaviour and habitat similarity, as these were positively correlated with a measure of dyadic association. These findings were matched in a community level analysis. Members of the same communities overwhelmingly shared the same habitat and foraging techniques, demonstrating a strong homophilic tendency. Both uni- and biparental relatedness between dyads were higher within than between communities. Our results illustrate that intraspecific variation in sociality in bottlenose dolphins is influenced by a complex combination of genetic, cultural, and environmental aspects. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Pulsed signal trains comprising clicks, buzzes, and burst-pulses play important roles in the life activities of odontocetes, but they have not been distinguished in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Underwater vocalizations of this species were recorded from 27 September to 2 October 2019 in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea. Pulsed signal trains were detected with variations in the pulsed signal number (range of 6–76), mean inter-pulse interval (IPIs_m: 0.1–315 ms), and mean duration (D ranged from tens to thousands of milliseconds). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis based on six acoustic parameters in the pulsed signal trains identified three categories of trains designated as clicks, burst-pulses, and buzzes. Buzzes and burst-pulses (different from those described in previous research) were detected for the first time in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in China. The results indicated that the IPIs_m was longest for clicks but shortest for buzzes, and the D values were longer for both clicks and burst-pulses than buzzes. The three train types could be identified based on the IPIs_m, with threshold values of 4.9 and 15.5 ms. The significant variations in the three vocalization types were related to surface behaviors, and buzzes could have a special function in foraging by this species, thereby requiring further research. These findings may facilitate future quantitative evaluations of the echolocation performance in wild Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and provide important guidance regarding acoustic observations and the identification of this species.

ABSTRACT: Commercial fishing constitutes an important food source but induces undesirable bycatch on animals worldwide. This study extends bycatch research geographically to the Western Pacific Ocean, filling a knowledge gap regarding bycatch and mitigation measures in the region. Bycatch has caused many lethal consequences to the pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) during their interaction with fisheries in the research area. We provided a self-developed acoustic deterrent system and conducted field experiments, suggesting its effectiveness as a potential useful conservation tool to reduce bycatch. Dolphins departed the area and the number of dolphins in sight declined to zero after the deployment of the system. Additional evidence was reflected in acoustic recordings, showing the number of clicks emitted by dolphins decreased from 1,502 to 136 per minute after the ADS was activated. Meanwhile, click amplitude was reduced by 84%, indicating an increase in the distance between dolphins and the system. These combined results indicate that the system was effective in driving dolphins away to facilitate the conservation of the species by protecting them from potential bycatch.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Social foraging decisions depend on individual payoffs. However, it is unclear how individual variation in phenotypic and behavioural traits can influence these payoffs, thereby the decisions to forage socially or individually. Here, we studied how individual traits influence foraging tactics of net-casting fishers who interact with wild dolphins. While net-casting is primarily an individual activity, in the traditional fishery with dolphins, fishers can choose between fishing in cooperative groups or solitarily. Our semi-structured interviews with fishers show their social network is mapped onto these foraging tactics. By quantifying the fishers’ catch, we found that fishers in cooperative groups catch more fish per capita than solitary fishers. By quantifying foraging and social traits of fishers, we found that the choice between foraging tactics—and whom to cooperate with—relates to differences in peer reputation and to similarities in number of friends, propensity to fish with relatives, and frequency of interaction with dolphins. These findings indicate different payoffs between foraging tactics and that by choosing the cooperative partner fishers likely access other benefits such as social prestige and embeddedness. These findings reveal the importance of not only material but also non-material benefits of social foraging tactics, which can have implications for the dynamics of this rare fishery. Faced with the current fluctuation in fishing resource availability, the payoffs of both tactics may change, affecting the fishers’ social and foraging decisions, potentially threatening the persistence of this century-old fishery involving humans and wildlife. Significance statement: Social foraging theory proposes that decisions to forage in groups are primarily driven by cost–benefit trade-offs that individuals experience, but it remains unclear whether, and how much, individual foragers’ characteristics influence these trade-offs and consequently the choice to forage in social groups. We study the artisanal net-casting fishers who choose between cooperating with each other or fishing alone when engaging in a rare interaction with wild dolphins. Our findings suggest that cooperative fishers capture more fish than solitary fishers, and that by choosing cooperative partners based on similarities and differences in key social (peer reputation, kinship, friendships) and foraging (fishing frequency) traits; these fishers also experience higher social prestige and more social embeddedness. These results suggest that material gains from foraging—but also non-material benefits accrued from socializing with like-minded individuals—can influence the dynamics of human social foraging. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a vulnerable marine mammal species that inhabits shallow, coastal waters from Southeast China, southward throughout Southeast Asia, and westward around the Bay of Bengal to eastern India. Polymorphic microsatellites are useful for elucidating ecological and population genetics-related questions. Here, 18 new polymorphic microsatellites were developed from S. chinensis genomic DNA by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Population genetic analyses were conducted on 42 S. chinensis individuals from three geographic locations, including the Xiamen Bay of China, the Western Gulf of Thailand, and Andaman Sea. Our microsatellite data revealed a strong and significant population structure among the three sampling regions (overall FST = 0.371, p =.001). Pairwise mutual information index also demonstrated high levels of genetic differentiation between different region pairs (values range from 0.272 to 0.339, p <.001). Moreover, Structure analysis inferred three genetic clusters, with the high assignment probabilities of 95.92%, 99.47%, and 99.68%, respectively. Principal coordinate analysis plots of individuals divided entire genotypes into three clusters, indicating high level of genetic differentiation. Our results indicated the strong genetic structure in S. chinensis populations is a result of geographic distances. Other factors such as environmental variables, anthropogenic interference, and social behavior may also have contributed to population differentiation. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Historically, traditional photo-identification (photo-ID) methods have been applied to cetaceans with relatively small group sizes, closed and/or small populations, distinctive dorsal fin nicks and/or notches and behavior allowing for photographic capture. Conversely, species with larger group and/or population sizes that often occur in open populations, which have less distinctive natural markings and/or whose behavior is prohibitive for photographic capture, have not been the focus of many photo-ID studies. We review two successful photo-ID studies on species that have less distinctive markings, but differ in habitats and behavior: (1) common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) that live in oceanic environments, have large group sizes, occur in open populations and are easily observed and (2) harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) that live in coastal environments, have small group sizes, but are behaviorally cryptic and elusive. We discuss how traditional photo-ID methods were adapted by incorporating different: (1) identification sides; (2) identification features; (3) levels of photo quality (PQ); (4) distinctiveness and; (5) methods for error checking. Adaptations include: using symmetry of the identification features to determine if both sides of the animal are used, using more than one identification feature, developing a matrix for describing/sorting by the identification features, using three levels of distinctiveness, incorporating PQ and distinctiveness into a flowchart to identify distinctively marked individuals (DMIs) and applying a more rigorous review process to identify possible errors in cataloguing. We discuss how adapting traditional photo-ID methods will improve our ability to use photo-ID for species not traditionally studied using this method. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: This article deals with the bending analysis of breast dolphins in the context of detecting safety zones during tanker berthing. The study focuses on modelling a flexible dolphin partially submerged in the muddy bottom in the present case. Reconstructing the material properties of dolphins is an inverse problem, and such problems are known for being difficult and ill-posed in mathematics. Different one-dimensional pile models with various boundary conditions are derived to solve this inverse problem. Complex finite element models are used to validate the one-dimensional models. Because the ship is moored in shallow water, more emphasis is placed on connecting the structural and hydrodynamic models in order to anticipate precise hydrodynamic loads. The parametric bending study of the mooring material properties was carried out for different ship displacements and mooring speeds. Based on the model results and the experimental data, it is possible to select the optimal model for a given berth. It can then be used with utmost confidence for complex mooring safety analyses to determine a particular jetty's navigational safety berthing zones. The procedure is described in its general form and can be used for various ports. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is the most endangered dolphin in the western South Atlantic Ocean due to bycatch. Our goal was to test the efficiency of a likely “seal safe” pinger (Banana Pinger, Fishtek Marine Ltd.) to ward off franciscanas, as well as investigating possible side effects of habituation and habitat exclusion. We deployed the pinger within a grid of click detectors (C-POD, Chelonia Ltd.) in Babitonga Bay, southern Brazil, and the narrow band high frequency sonar click trains were used as a proxy for presence of the franciscanas and response to the pinger. The presence of franciscanas next to the pinger and at 100 m away decreased by 19.4% and 15.4%, respectively, when the pinger was switched on, indicating that the franciscanas avoided the area of the pinger. This avoidance response could not be seen at 400 m away. No habituation effect was noted at any distance. There was a slight gradual decrease in detections over the course of the study at all distances, which is probably related to seasonal variation in the population's habitat use, but this requires attention in future studies. The likely “seal safe” pinger sounds effectively warded off franciscanas and thus has the potential to reduce bycatch. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Understanding determinants of differential reproductive success is at the core of evolutionary biology because of its connection to fitness. Early work has linked variation in reproductive success to differences in age,1 rank,2 or size,3,4 as well as habitat characteristics.5 More recently, studies in group-living taxa have revealed that social relationships also have measurable effects on fitness.6–8 The influence of social bonds on fitness is particularly interesting in males who compete over reproductive opportunities. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, groups of 4-14 unrelated male bottlenose dolphins cooperate in second-order alliances to compete with rival alliances over access to females.9–12 Nested within second-order alliances, pairs or trios of males, which can vary in composition, form first-order alliances to herd estrus females. Using 30 years of behavioral data, we examined how individual social factors, such as first-order alliance stability, social connectivity, and variation in social bond strength within second-order alliances, affect male fitness. Analyzing the reproductive careers of 85 males belonging to 10 second-order alliances, we found that the number of paternities a male achieved was positively correlated with his cumulative social bond strength but negatively correlated with his variation in bond strength. Thus, well-integrated males with more homogeneous social bonds to second-order allies obtained most paternities. Our findings provide novel insights into the fitness benefits of polyadic cooperation among unrelated males and highlight the adaptive value of social bonds in this context. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems where they are in continuous contact with multiple abiotic and biotic stressors in the environment. Due to their role as predators, they can bioaccumulate contaminants and are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems. The northern zonal coast of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico has a high incidence of anthropogenic activities. The principal objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to determine the presence of trace metals and their correlation with lipids in bottlenose dolphin blubber, and 2) to use a lipidomics approach to characterize their biological responses. Levels of trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Pb) were analyzed using ICP-MS and lipids were measured using a targeted lipidomics approach with LC-MS/MS. Spearman correlation analysis was used to identify associations between lipids and trace elements. The influences of gender, stranding codes, presence of stomach content, growth stages and body length were also analyzed. Blubber lipid composition was dominated by triacylglycerols (TAG). Our results demonstrated the presence of heavy-metal elements such as Cd and As, which were correlated with different lipid species, mainly the ceramides and glycerophospholipids, respectively. Organisms with Cd showed lower concentrations of ceramides (CER, HCER and DCER), TAG and cholesteryl esters (CE). Trace elements Cr, Co, As and Cd increased proportionately with body length. This study provides a novel insight of lipidomic characterization and correlations with trace elements in the bottlenose dolphin which might contribute to having a better understanding of the physiological functions and the risks that anthropogenic activities can bring to sentinel organisms from coastal regions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In all mammals, the superior olivary complex (SOC) comprises a group of auditory brainstem nuclei that are important for sound localization. Its principal nuclei, the lateral superior olive (LSO) and the medial superior olive (MSO) process interaural time and intensity differences, which are the main cues for sound localization in the horizontal plane. Toothed whales (odontocetes) rely heavily on hearing and echolocation for foraging, orientation, and communication and localize sound with great acuity. The investigation of the SOC in odontocetes provides insight into adaptations to underwater hearing and echolocation. However, quantitative anatomical data for odontocetes are currently lacking. We quantified the volume, total neuron number, and neuron density of the LSO of six common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) using the Cavalieri principle and the unbiased stereology optical fractionator. Our results show that the LSO in D. delphis has a volume of 150 + (SD = 27) mm3, which is on average 69 (SEM = 19) times larger than the LSO in human, or 37 (SEM = 11) times larger than the human LSO and MSO combined. The LSO of D. delphis contains 20,876 ± (SD = 3300) neurons. In comparison, data reported for the human brainstem indicate the LSO has only about ¼ that number but about the same number for the LSO and MSO combined (21,100). LSO neurons range from 21 to 25 μm (minor axis) and from 44 to 61 μm (major axis) in transverse sections. The LSO neuron packing density is 1080 ± (SD = 204) neurons/mm3, roughly half of the LSO neuron density in human. SMI-32-immunohistochemistry was used to visualize projection neurons in the LSO and revealed the presence of principal, marginal, and multipolar neurons in transverse sections. The distinct morphology of the LSO likely reflects the common dolphin's superb sensitivity to ultra-high frequencies and ability to detect and analyze sounds and their location as part of its underwater spatial localization and echolocation tasks. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Small-scale fisheries represent an economically marginalized sector, that struggles to balance operational costs and profit from catches. Economic revenues from catches have declined due to overfishing, and additional costs may jeopardise the sustainability of the sector. In Greece, reported net damage from interaction with marine megafauna, especially the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a common occurrence for many coastal areas, where small-scale fisheries operate. A seasonal experimental trial took place during 2016–2017 in the northern Aegean Sea, in an area where large actively swimming marine organisms other than dolphins were lacking. Three gangs of different panels of net (mixed gill nets and trammel nets) were deployed in three different depth zones. For each gang, we recorded the number, size, and position of holes on each net, and assessed overall damage. Multifactor analysis was used to identify possible links between fishing practices and damage intensity. Results showed a correlation between reduced net damage by dolphins with larger mesh sizes and increasing depth. In the case of small mesh sizes, one should seek a combination of solutions, as changes in deployment depths alone, do not seem to be adequate for the depth ranges studied. The adoption of larger than 22 mm mesh size is proposed for all set nets, to increase net selectivity and decrease accumulated damage. Fishers should focus on adjusting, substituting or even ceasing specific fishing tactics to have the lowest possible economic loss, whereas fisheries scientists, managers and policy makers must monitor and offer guidance for this transition. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of biodiversity hotspots in Agrigento waters (Mediterranean Sea) to define the conservation area for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and seabirds (Calonectris diomedea, Puffinus yelkouan, and Hydrobates pelagicus), according to European directives. With this purpose, the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) was applied to the sighting points of the focal species. They co-occur in the study area and have been documented to forage behind trawlers. In this study, a fishing rate was designed and used as an explanatory variable of the species distribution, together with physiographic variables. Data were collected during 68 surveys in the waters off Agrigento province. MaxEnt models showed a strong predictive power, with distance from the coast being the greatest predicting variable, followed by slope, depth, and fishing rate. For all the species considered, the probability of presence increased as the fishing rate grew. Cartographic analysis revealed one area shared by the species, which occupies 529 km2, from the shoreline to 100 m depth. This study increases knowledge on the distribution and habitat preferences of the target species in the Sicilian waters. Evaluating the influence of fisheries is a promising method that needs further testing to apply effective management measures. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Pacific white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens (PWSDs), migrate along the coast of Japan. PWSDs rarely emit whistles, instead utilizing pulses, unlike many other delphinid species that frequently emit whistle sounds. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the acoustic characteristics and repertoire of the whistle of PWSDs, which have not been reported so far. We analyzed PWSD whistle sound systems (e.g., acoustic parameters and contours) during boat surveys and using passive acoustic monitoring in shallow coastal waters in the northern Sea of Japan. PWSDs in Shakotan rarely emitted whistles, while the burst pulse frequently was as reported in previous studies in other waters. The PWSD whistle vocalization rates were higher during traveling than during foraging. The frequency and duration of their whistles did not appear to change between behaviors. Although complex multiloop whistles were not recorded, whistle contours were classified into seven types. Whistles are often recorded intensively in a short period as a sequence or bout. Considering the extremely low whistle vocalization rates, dolphins may choose whistles instead of pulsed sounds in limited contexts. Our results shed light on the differences in whistle sound usage within odontocete species. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Opportunities to include Cetancodontamorpha in the study of the evolution of the immune system in the clades of Artiodactylamorpha, Ruminantiamorpha, Suinamorpha, and Camelidamorpha have increased with the use of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, as a sentinel species to study the effects of environmental pollutants on the health of marine mammals. Efforts are currently underway to increase the number reagents needed for detailed studies. Thus far, screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made to leukocyte differentiation molecules (LDM) and the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and class II molecules in Ruminantiamorpha have yielded some mAbs that recognize conserved epitopes expressed on orthologues in the bottlenose dolphin. More direct approaches are in progress to identify additional mAbs to bottlenose LDM and cytokines. As reported here, both direct and indirect approaches were used to identify mAbs specific for cytokines useful in monitoring the effects of environmental pollutants on the immune system. Immunization of mice with expressed bottlenose dolphin cytokines yielded mAbs specific for IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17A. Screening of previously developed mAbs used in livestock immunology research revealed mAbs developed against ovine IFN-γ and bovine IL-17 and IL-1β recognize conserved epitopes in bottlenose dolphin orthologues. The mAbs identified in the present study expand the reagents available to study the function of the immune system in bottlenose dolphins and cattle. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the dynamics of small-scale fisheries requires considering the diversity of behaviours and skills of fishers. Fishers may have different abilities and tactics that can translate into different fishing outcomes. Here, we investigate variation in fishing behaviours among traditional net-casting fishers that are assisted by wild dolphins, and how this variation interacts with environmental conditions and influences fishing success. By combining in situ environmental sampling with fine-scale behavioural tracking from overhead videos, we found a higher probability of catching fish among fishers well-positioned in the water and that cast their nets wide-open and closer to dolphins. These differences in net-casting performance affect their chance of catching any fish over and above environmental conditions related to fish availability. This finding suggests that fishers' success may not be simply an outcome of variations in resource availability, but also result from subtle variations in fishing behaviours. We discuss how such behavioural variations can represent skills acquired over the years, and how such skills can be crucial for fishers to benefit and keep interacting with dolphins. Our study demonstrates the role of behavioural variation in the dynamics of a century-old fishery and highlights the need to consider fishers' behaviours in co-management of small-scale fisheries.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The effect of a specific Chinese swimmer’s trunk oscillation on dolphin kick was investigated in order to optimize competitive swimming movement. Using a numerical simulation method based on multi-body motion, different swimmer’s trunk oscillation during a dolphin kick was analyzed. The simulation was conducted using 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and renormalization group k-ε turbulence model, combined with the Volume of Fluid method to capture the water surface. The simulation’s results were evaluated by comparing them with experimental data and with previous studies. The net streamwise forces, mean swimming velocity, and joint moments were also investigated. There was a positive correlation between the mean swimming velocity and the amplitudes of the swimmer’s trunk oscillation, where the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.986 and the selected model was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, as the mean swimming velocity increased from 1.42 m/s in Variant 1 to 2 m/s in Variant 5, the maximum positive moments of joints increased by about 24.7% for the ankles, 27.4% for the knees, −3.9% for the hips, and 5.8% for the upper waist, whereas the maximum negative moments of joints increased by about 64.5% for the ankles, 28.1% for the knees, 23.1% for the hips, and 10.1% for the upper waist. The relationship between the trunk oscillation and the vortices was also investigated. Therefore, it is recommended that swimmers should try to increase the amplitudes of trunk oscillation to increase their swimming velocity. In order to achieve this goal, swimmers should increase strength training for the ankles, knees, and upper waist during the upkick. Moreover, extra strength training is warranted for the ankles, knees, hips, and upper waist during the downkick. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Importance of the work: Irrawaddy dolphins have experienced demographic decline. The lack of genetic information might hamper management decisions necessary for restoring population viability. Objectives: To apply population genetics and mitogenome phylogenetic analyses to assess genetic diversity and connectivity among Irrawaddy dolphin populations in Indonesia and Thailand. Materials & Methods: Samples from stranded dolphins were collected from Mahakam River and East Kalimantan, Indonesia and from Songkhla Lake and the Lower and Upper Gulf of Thailand. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogeny and pairwise population differentiation, the divergence times were estimated between Irrawaddy dolphin lineages and potential historical factors influencing the observed genetic structure were inferred. Results: The Indonesian populations had lower mtDNA diversity compared to Thailand populations. Pairwise population differentiation and analysis of molecular variance based on the control region supported high differentiation among fragmented Thailand and Indonesian populations (FST = 0.6622, p < 0.0001) with 66.21% variation among groups, except for the Songkhla Lake and coastal Lower Gulf populations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close relationships between some of the Thai and Indonesian haplotypes, suggesting historical freshwater connectivity. There was a lack of monophyly despite the strong support for the Mahakam River clade in Indonesia. The Mahakam River population started to diversify during the late Pleistocene (~304.4 Ka; 95% highest posterior density (HPD) = 157.8–505.3 Ka), possibly due to sea-level fluctuation and changes in palaeodrainage systems. Main finding: The results of the genetic diversity and complex evolutionary history of the Irrawaddy dolphin raise conservation concerns and support management strategies aiming to restore population connectivity and reduce the impacts of genetic and demographic stochasticity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

ABSTRACT: Ecological niche theory predicts the coexistence of closely related species is promoted by resource partitioning in space and time. Australian snubfin (Orcaella heinsohni) and humpback (Sousa sahulensis) dolphins live in sympatry throughout most of their range in northern Australian waters. We compared stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in their skin to investigate resource partitioning between these ecologically similar species. Skin samples were collected from live Australian snubfin (n = 31) and humpback dolphins (n = 23) along the east coast of Queensland in 2014–2015. Both species had similar δ13C and δ15N values and high (>50%) isotopic niche space overlap, suggesting that they feed at similar trophic levels, have substantial dietary overlap, and rely on similar basal food resources. Despite similarities, snubfin dolphins were more likely to have a larger δ15N value than humpback dolphins, indicating they may forage on a wider diversity of prey. Humpback dolphins were more likely to have a larger δ13C range suggesting they may forage on a wider range of habitats. Overall, results suggest that subtle differences in habitat use and prey selection are likely the principal resource partitioning mechanisms enabling the coexistence of Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A 5-y-old female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) from an aquarium in Japan had clinical signs of anorexia, vomiting, and bradykinesia. Enrofloxacin and lactated Ringer solution were administered for treatment of bacterial infection and for rehydration. Elevations of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were detected on day 4 of treatment, indicating that rhabdomyolysis had developed on day 3. On day 5, serum creatinine and urea concentrations increased and remained high throughout the remaining treatment; the dolphin died on day 16. Postmortem examination revealed massive necrosis of the longissimus dorsi muscles. Histologic examination revealed extensive necrosis of skeletal myofibers, multifocal renal tubular necrosis with intratubular casts and crystals, and suppurative bronchopneumonia. The renal casts labeled positively with anti-myoglobin antibody; expression of aquaporin-1 was decreased in renal tubules compared to normal kidney tissue. To our knowledge, this description of clinicopathologic findings of rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury with concomitant crystalline nephropathy has not been reported previously in a bottlenose dolphin. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans are tight-skinned mammals that exhibit an extraordinary capacity to heal deep soft tissue injuries. However, essential information of large full-thickness wound healing in cetaceans is still lacking. Here, the stages of full-thickness wound healing were characterized in Fraser’s dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei). The skin samples were collected from normal skin and full-thickness cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis)-bite wounds of stranded carcasses. We defined five stages of wound healing according to macroscopic and histopathological examinations. Wounds in Stage 1 and 2 were characterized by intercellular and intracellular edema in the epidermal cells near the wound edge, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration, and degradation of collagen fibers. In Stage 3 wounds, melanocytes, melanin granules, rete and dermal ridges were noticed in the neo-epidermis, and the adipose tissue in adjacent blubber was replaced by cells and fibers. Wounds in Stage 4 and 5 were characterized by gradual restoration of the normal skin architecture including rete and dermal ridges, collagen bundles, and adipose tissue. These phenomena were quite different from previous studies in terrestrial tight-skinned mammals, and therefore, further in-depth research into the mechanisms of dolphin wound healing would be needed to gain new insights into veterinary and human regenerative medicine. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Mexican Central Pacific (MCP) has complex oceanographic dynamics, with a well-defined seasonal pattern and influence of interannual sea surface temperature anomalies. The present study investigated the relationship between the distribution/abundance of spotted dolphins and the environmental conditions in the MCP. Dolphin sighting data were collected during January 2010–December 2015; distance to coast, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll a (Chla) were obtained for each sighting location through georeferenced maps and satellite images. A total of 746 spotted dolphin sightings were obtained with a survey effort of 31,695 km. Spotted dolphins in the MCP showed a predominantly coastal distribution regardless of environmental conditions. Significant differences were detected concerning regional seasonal variation, with higher mean sighting rate during the stratified periods and higher density/abundance estimates during the mixed periods. Spotted dolphins showed preference for warmer conditions, with higher mean sighting rate, abundance, and distance to coast during the neutral and warm interannual periods. During the coolest conditions (cold periods), mean sighting rate and abundance decreased and spotted dolphins were located closer to the coast, where Chla concentration increased. These results suggest that changes in the distribution/abundance of these dolphins could be associated with habitat quality related to tropical (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) and extratropical (The Blob) oceanographic phenomena, which could be modulating their foraging activities. © Evelyn R Díaz-Torres, Emigdio Marín-Enríquez, Antonio Corgos, Aramis Olivos-Ortiz, Christian D Ortega-Ortiz.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Little is known about the glycosylation of placental villi and areolae of cetaceans. Term tissue from the delivered placenta of an Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) was examined using lectin histochemistry to compare trophoblast glycosylation in these two locations. Methods: Placental blocks fixed in 10% formalin were resin-embedded before semithin sections were stained with 24 biotinylated lectins and an avidin-biotin revealing system. Results: Areolar trophoblast was composed of large, bulbous cells packed with numerous granules compared to the smaller, cuboidal cells clothing the chorionic villi, which had a sparser, mainly subapical granule population. Both were richly glycosylated; generally areolar cells were more heavily stained apart from poor binding to some N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine termini. Most striking was the distribution of α1,2-linked fucosyl residues, weakly expressed in villous trophoblast but intensely stained in some areolar cells, also terminal sialic acids. Some lectins bound in a variable fashion. Staining of terminal α-D-mannose, which locates mainly to lysosomes, was heavy in areolar cells compared to scattered irregular foci in villous cells. Discussion and conclusion: The many intracellular inclusions reflect ongoing lysosomal breakdown of histotroph in areolar cells which often show heterogeneous glycosylation staining unlike the uniformly stained villous cells, possibly reflecting partial breakdown of ingested sialoglycoprotein, cell turnover or regional variation in uptake of histotroph. Our results indicate that Dolphin areolae are functionally distinct from villous trophoblast, performing absorptive and phagocytic functions similar to other Artiodactyla. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Cumulative exposure to sub-lethal anthropogenic stressors can affect the health and reproduction of coastal cetaceans and hence their population viability. To date, we do not have a clear understanding of the notion of health for cetaceans in an ecological context; that is, how health status affects the ability of individuals to survive and reproduce. Here, we make use of a unique health-monitoring programme of estuarine bottlenose dolphins in South Carolina and Florida to determine de novo changes in biological pathways, using untargeted plasma metabolomics, depending on the health status of individuals obtained from veterinary screening. We found that individuals that were in a poor health state had lower circulating amino acids pointing towards increased involvement of gluconeogenesis (i.e., new formation of glucose). More mechanistic work is needed to disentangle the interconnection between health and energy metabolism in cetaceans to mediate potential metabolic constraints they may face during periods of stress. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The suborder Whippormorpha is small by number but features the largest of all vertebrates, cetaceans (whales and dolphins), as well as hippopotamuses (Waddell et al. 1999). Despite previous consideration that hippopotamuses were more closely related to Suidae (pigs) (Geisler and Uhen 2005), common ancestry is to the Artiodactyla, or even-toed ungulates considering similar auditory structures, hairless bodies, dense subcutaneous fat, and molecular analysis (Gatesy 1997; Thewissen et al. 2007; Beck et al. 2006; Tsagkogeorga et al. 2015). Despite similarities, the ocular anatomy of cetaceans is quite distinct from that of hippopotamuses. Little is known about ocular disease and in hippopotamuses, however, our understanding of how to manage and prevent ophthalmic conditions affecting cetaceans that are under human care. We provide here a review of Whippomorpha ocular anatomy and morphology, as well as the current state of clinical ophthalmology in these species. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

ABSTRACT: Background: Lipotes vexillifer, is a functionally extinct species of freshwater dolphin commonly called as Baiji dolphin of Yanzte River, China. The dolphin is thought to be the first one of it's kind driven to extinction due to the impact of humans. Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition carried out in the year 2006 revealed the species as functionally extinct. The présent study deals with the population viability analysis of the baiji dolphin using Vortex software and also by consulting historical materials and relevant literature to explore the possible causes of the functional extinction of the baiji in the Yangtze River. The findings are to provide guidance for the effective management of another freshwater mammal, the Yangtze finless porpoise. Methods: Population viability analysis of the baiji dolphin for various parameters were assessed using Vortex software and other published information and relevant literatures. The analysis were carried out to ascertain the possible causes of the functional extinction of the baiji in the Yangtze River. Result: Simulation models were employed to identify the reasons for extinction of Yangtze River baiji population by adopting viability retrospective method. The various parameters associated with the population analysis were included to derive logical conclusion. The minimum viable population of the Yangtze River baiji was also identified by adopting various simulation models. The present study is the first attempt to apply the 10,000-time iteration method to the baiji population survivability analysis. © 2022 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals can serve as an indicator of ecosystem health, and are likely exposed to significant amounts of microplastics (MPs). In this study we estimated the MP uptake of two odontocetes, the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), in the Mediterranean Sea and the Northeast Atlantic. These two species are expected to primarily ingest MPs through trophic transfer. To this end, data was collected on their diet, which was subsequently linked to MP occurrence and abundance in prey families. We estimated that D. delphis ingests 76 MPs/day in the Northeast Atlantic and 164 MPs/day in the Mediterranean, and T. truncatus ingests 36 MPs/day in the Northeast Atlantic and 179 MPs/day in the Mediterranean. This study provides important new predictions on MP exposure in two odontocetes, and opens up new research opportunities on the effect of this exposure on the health of organisms. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Small populations of cetaceans with restricted ranges are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances. The assessment of demographic parameters for these populations can provide meaningful insight into the ways in which they are being impacted by different threats. The Taiwanese white dolphin (TWD), Sousa chinensis taiwanensis, is a subspecies endemic to Taiwan and is classified as Critically Endangered. Multistate robust design mark–recapture models were fitted under a Bayesian framework to estimate demographic parameters and trends for the population from 2010 to 2018. Differences in these parameters by age category and the dolphins' use of their habitat were also explored. Abundance estimates varied from a maximum of 72 in 2010 (95% credible interval (CI) [65, 78]) to a minimum of 61 (95% CI [58, 64]) in 2017. In the oldest age category, abundance estimates varied from 10 (95% CI [10, 11]) in 2013 to 13 (95% CI [10, 13]) in 2016. Modelling showed that, over time, the abundance of dolphins in the oldest age group remained stable, while the remainder of the population, which includes reproductive individuals, experienced a steady decline. This decline is bound to affect the demographic recovery of TWD. Spatial heterogeneity indicated that some areas (i.e. with consistent high occurrences) likely represent important areas for biological functions of the TWD. This suggests that the recovery of the population may be enhanced with immediate and focused actions (such as the ban of gillnet fisheries) in these areas. However, with a small and declining population, reducing threats throughout their entire range is needed, including the new offshore windfarm development being constructed in and adjacent to the dolphin's range. Concerted actions to address known threats, continued monitoring of the population, and education of stakeholders are needed to prevent the extinction of the TWDs. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Late initiation of antiretrovirals in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of perinatal transmission and higher infant mortality. We report the final 72-week postpartum results for efficacy and safety of dolutegravir-based compared with efavirenz-based regimens in mothers and infants. Methods: DolPHIN-2 was a randomised, open-label trial. Pregnant women in South Africa and Uganda aged at least 18 years, with untreated but confirmed HIV infection and an estimated gestation of at least 28 weeks, initiating antiretroviral therapy in third trimester were eligible for inclusion. Eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either dolutegravir-based (50 mg dolutegravir, 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and either 200 mg emtricitabine in South Africa or 300 mg lamivudine in Uganda) or efavirenz-based (fixed dose combination 600 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus either emtricitabine in South Africa or lamivudine in Uganda) therapy. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL measured at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks postpartum with a Cox model adjusting for viral load and CD4 cell count. Safety endpoints were summarised by the number of women and infants with events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03249181. Findings: Between Jan 23 and Aug 15, 2018, 280 women were screened for inclusion, of whom 268 (96%) women were randomly assigned: 133 (50%) to the efavirenz group and 135 (50%) to the dolutegravir group. 250 (93%; 125 [50%] in the efavirenz group and 125 [50%] in the dolutegravir group) women were included in the intention-to-treat analysis of efficacy. Median time to viral load of less than 50 copies per mL was 4·1 weeks (IQR 4·0–5·1) in the dolutegravir group compared with 12·1 weeks (10·7–13·3) in the efavirenz group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·93 [95% CI 1·5–2·5]). At 72 weeks postpartum, 116 (93%) mothers in the dolutegravir group and 114 (91%) in the efavirenz group had a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL. Of 57 (21%) mothers with a severe adverse event, three (2%) in the dolutegravir group and five (4%) in the efavirenz group were related to the drug (dolutegravir drug-related events were one woman each with suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, herpes zoster meningitis; efavirenz drug-related events were one woman each with suicide attempt and liver cirrhosis, and three people with drug-induced liver injury). Of 136 (56%) infants in whom severe adverse events were recorded, none were related to the study drugs. In addition to the three infant HIV infections detected at birth in the dolutegravir group that have been previously reported, an additional transmission in the efavirenz group occurred during breastfeeding despite optimal maternal viral suppression and serial negative infant tests in the first year of life. Interpretation: Dolutegravir was safe and well tolerated, supporting updated WHO treatment recommendations in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Infant HIV transmissions can occur during breastfeeding despite persistently undetectable maternal viral load highlighting the need for continued infant testing.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean neurobrucellosis is a common cause of strandings in Costa Rica diagnosed by serology, bacteriology, and histopathology. Pathological studies were performed on 18 dolphins. Twelve were scanned by postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) as a complementary tool for describing neurobrucellosis and osteoarticular alterations associated with Brucella ceti infections. The central nervous system (CNS) and the skeleton of five dolphins not infected with B ceti did not reveal alterations by PMCT scanning. Seven Brucella-infected dolphins showed at least bilateral ventriculomegaly associated with hydrocephalus and accumulation in CSF in the lateral ventricles. We performed semiquantitative grading of the inflammatory process in the different areas of the CNS and evaluated the thickness of the cellular infiltrate in the meninges and the perivascular cuffs. The results for the severity grading were graphed to provide an injury profile associated with each area of the CNS. Age is not a decisive factor regarding neurobrucellosis presentation. The severity of ventriculomegaly by PMCT does not directly correlate with the severity of the inflammatory index determined by histopathological parameters of the brain cortex and other CNS regions, suggesting that these processes, although linked, are multifactorial and need further characterization and validation to establish better cutoffs on the PMCT. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Unsustainable fisheries practices carried out in large parts of the Amazon, Tocantins, and Orinoco basins have contributed to the decline in the populations of the Amazon River dolphins (Inia spp.), considered Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Amazon River dolphin byproducts are often obtained through unregulated fisheries and from stranded and incidentally caught individuals that are traded for the flesh and blubber used for Calophysus macropterus fisheries, traditional and other medicinal purposes, and more recently for human consumption. To identify localities of use of Amazon River dolphins, we conducted a systematic review of the related literature published since 1980, complemented with structured surveys of researchers that allowed the identification of 57 localities for uses of Inia (33 in the Amazon, two in the Tocantins, and 22 in the Orinoco basins), and two more on the Brazilian Atlantic coast, with recent reports of targeted consumption in the upper Orinoco River. Subsequently, the localities of use or bushmeat markets where Amazon River dolphin byproducts are trafficked were identified. This information was integrated with a kernel density analysis of the distribution of the Inia spp. populations establishing core areas. Our spatial analysis indicated that the use of Inia spp. is geographically widespread in the evaluated basins. It is urgent that decision-makers direct policies towards mitigating the socioeconomic and cultural circumstances associated with illegal practices affecting Amazon River dolphin populations in South America.

ABSTRACT: In the current practice of structural design for berth structures, the mooring forces (tension in lines and compression in fenders) are typically determined through simplified linear static analyses, and then magnified by dynamic amplification coefficients. It is known, however, that the mooring's stiffness presents nonlinearities (both physical and geometrical) that may at times become relevant, raising the issue of whether linear analyses are really adequate. Also, the environmental loads induce oscillatory behavior whose peak values may not always be satisfactorily estimated through dynamic amplification coefficients, which are far from being well defined in the technical literature. This work presents an investigation on the forces developed on mooring systems of vessels berthed at dolphins, and the consequences of the current design practice's simplifications. Different hierarchical models are defined (linear static, nonlinear static and linear dynamic in the frequency domain) for a case study of a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) permanently berthed at dolphins at the Barcarena's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Pará, Brazil. The vessel's displacements and their peak values are determined through stochastic and statistical theories. The corresponding forces on the mooring system are computed and the dynamic amplification coefficients therefrom obtained. A thorough discussion on the results is provided. The methodology presented may be a useful tool to ascertain the dynamic amplification coefficients required in the simplified methodologies from the international standards. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: CASE DESCRIPTION A 19-year-old male bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) presented with inappetence and avoidant behavior. CLINICAL FINDINGS Ultrasound revealed a large-volume left-sided pleural effusion, which was consistent with chronic nonchylous lymphatic effusion and mild chronic hemorrhage by cytology. Computed tomography identified ipsilateral rib fractures, atelectasis, nodular pleuritis, marginal lymph node enlargement, and suspected dilation of the thoracic duct and internal thoracic veins. Fifteen lipids were significantly higher in serum of the dolphin as compared with controls (n = 3) using nontargeted lipidomics. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME A series of thoracentesis procedures were performed. Follow-up CT demonstrated marked reduction in pleural effusion with persistence of thoracic duct dilation and mass-like areas of pleural thickening. Ultrasonographic resolution of pleural effusion occurred 14 months after presentation; however, recrudescence was noted 5 months later. Over a total of 24 months, 21.52 L of pleural effusion was removed. Despite the presence of pleural effusion, the patient was clinically stable during this time and quality of life was considered good on the basis of continuous animal welfare evaluations. Humane euthanasia was elected following acute clinical decline 27 months after initial diagnosis. Necropsy confirmed severe pleural effusion, chronic severe pleural fibrosis with chronic hemorrhage, and mediastinal fibrosis with entrapped lymph nodes and thymic tissue. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Pleuritis and effusion were suspected sequelae of previous rib fractures. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nonchylous lymphatic pleural effusion with repeated pleural drainage and diagnostic imaging for clinical management in a bottlenose dolphin. © 2022 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: We report the genome sequences of two Erysipelothrix isolates from fatal cases of sepsis in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The genomes were found to be most closely related to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Erysipelothrix piscisicarius. This information expands our knowledge of the genetic characteristics of this pathogen, which can affect free-ranging marine mammals. © 2022 Nesbitt et al.

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is commonly utilized to monitor cetacean species’ distribution, abundance, and behavior. The demand for automated methods to detect and extract cetacean vocalizations from acoustic data has increased in the last few decades. Automatic whistle extraction of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (IPBD) and other whistle-producing delphinids habitating in the coastal areas represents a challenging problem due to the high ambient noise, including ship noise snapping shrimp at the same habitat. The acoustic signal containing snapping shrimp sound was usually excluded during the development of the detection method. A robust tool of bioacoustics for snapping shrimp sound is still lacking. This study trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for semantic segmentation, initially developed for autonomous driving, to extract the whistle contour from spectrogram at a pixel level. A total of 1600 datasets was annotated for training and testing. As a result, the semantic segmentation classified the whistle with an overall mean Precision of 0.96, Accuracy of 0.89, and F-score of 0.86. In particular, the semantic segmentation extracted the whistle even if associated with a rich snapping shrimp sound, which the conventional method is incapable of. The advancement of metrics presented in this paper will enable long-term assessment of the IPBD population and individual or group tracking. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Microsatellites are one of the important genome characterizations that can be a valuable resource for variety identification, genetic diversity, phylogenetic analysis, as well as comparative and conservation genomics research. Here, we developed comprehensive microsatellites through genome-wide mining for the threatened cetacean Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). We found 87,757 microsatellites with 2–6 bp nucleotide motifs, showing that about 32.5 microsatellites per megabase comprises microsatellites sequences. Approximately 97.8% of the markers developed in this study were consistent with the published identified markers. About 75.3% microsatellites were with dinucleotide motifs, followed by tetranucleotide motifs (17.4%), sharing the same composition pattern as other cetaceans. The microsatellites were not evenly distributed in the S. chinensis genome, mainly in non-coding regions, with only about 0.5% of the markers located in coding regions. The microsatellite-containing genes were mainly functionally enriched in the methylation process, probably demonstrating the potential impacts of microsatellites on biological functions. Polymorphic microsatellites were developed between different genders of S. chinensis, which was expected to lay the foundation for genetic diversity investigation in cetaceans. The specific markers for a male IndoPacific humpback dolphin will provide comprehensive and representative male candidate markers for sex identification, providing a potential biomolecular tool for further analysis of population structure and social behavior of wild populations, population trend evaluation, and species conservation management. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Erysipelas, caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, is considered one of the most serious infectious diseases of captive and free-ranging cetaceans worldwide, as these animals are known to be highly susceptible to the bacterial infections. The potential diversity between E. rhusiopathiae isolates from captive cetaceans has been previously described; however, the microbiological features of the free-ranging cetacean isolates remain unclear. Here, we describe a case of bacteremia in a rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) caused by E. rhusiopathiae. Additionally, we present the first genomic features of the bacteria from free-ranging cetacean individuals. Histopathological and microbial examinations revealed that E. rhusiopathiae caused bacteremia and systemic infection in the dolphin. The genome of the isolated E. rhusiopathiae strain KC-Sb-R1, which was classified as Clade 1 possessing SpaB gene, was clearly differentiated from the other swine-isolated E. rhusiopathiae, and the comparison of its serovar-defining chromosomal region revealed that our isolate was greatly similar to those of other previously reported serovar 2/15 isolates, including the captive-dolphin isolate. Moreover, most of the potential virulence factors in the strain KC-Sb-R1 were similar to those in the strain Fujisawa. Further, a potential cytotoxicity of the isolate was confirmed, suggesting that marine mammal-isolated E. rhusiopathiae could possess strong pathogenic potential in other animals, including humans. These results would further increase our understanding on the risk factors for controlling zoonotic pathogens of emerging infectious diseases in captive or free-ranging cetaceans, and also provide important insight into the diversity of E. rhusiopathiae in animals.

ABSTRACT: Brucella ceti, a zoonotic pathogen of major concern to cetacean health and conservation, is responsible for severe meningo-encephalitic/myelitic lesions in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), often leading to their stranding and death. This study investigated, for the first time, the cellular prion protein (PrPc) expression in the brain tissue from B. ceti-infected, neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins. Seven B. ceti-infected, neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins, found stranded along the Italian coastline (6) and in the Canary Islands (1), were investigated, along with five B. ceti-uninfected striped dolphins from the coast of Italy, carrying no brain lesions, which served as negative controls. Western Blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an anti-PrP murine monoclonal antibody were carried out on the brain parenchyma of these dolphins. While PrPc IHC yielded inconclusive results, a clear-cut PrPc expression of different intensity was found by means of WB analyses in the brain tissue of all the seven herein investigated, B. ceti-infected and neurobrucellosis-affected cetacean specimens, with two dolphins stranded along the Italian coastline and one dolphin beached in Canary Islands also exhibiting a statistically significant increase in cerebral PrPc expression as compared to the five Brucella spp.-negative control specimens. The significantly increased PrPc expression found in three out of seven B. ceti-infected, neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins does not allow us to draw any firm conclusion(s) about the putative role of PrPc as a host cell receptor for B. ceti. Should this be the case, an upregulation of PrPc mRNA in the brain tissue of neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins could be hypothesized during the different stages of B. ceti infection, as previously shown in murine bone marrow cells challenged with Escherichia coli. Noteworthy, the inflammatory infiltrates seen in the brain and in the cervico-thoracic spinal cord segments from the herein investigated, B. ceti-infected and neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins were densely populated by macrophage/histiocyte cells, often harboring Brucella spp. antigen in their cytoplasm, similarly to what was reported in macrophages from mice experimentally challenged with B. abortus. Notwithstanding the above, much more work is needed in order to properly assess the role of PrPc, if any, as a host cell receptor for B. ceti in striped dolphins. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: For most marine vertebrates, chemical cues provide crucial information during navigation and foraging, but their use by cetaceans is still poorly understood. In contrast to baleen whales, toothed whales (odontocetes) are scarcely equipped for chemoreception: they lack the conventional anatomical structures (i.e., olfactory epithelium, nerves and bulbs) involved in olfaction and have reduced taste buds on the tongue. Several behavioral studies have however shown that captive dolphins can perceive chemical solutions, including odorants, in their oral cavity. To investigate whether odontocetes could use infochemicals in their foraging ecology, we implemented a behavioral response experiment in wild bottlenose dolphins and long-finned pilot whales. We tested dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a potentially attractive stimulus since it is a chemical signature of highly productive marine areas, known to attract several marine predators including fishes and seabirds. We assessed cetacean responses to DMS exposure by analyzing their movements and surface behaviors recorded by onboard observers. In both species, results did not reveal any significant attraction or behavioral reaction toward DMS when compared to a control chemical stimulus, apart from a short-distance response in bottlenose dolphins. These results suggest that while odontocetes may perceive DMS in water, it apparently does not play a significant role in their foraging ecology. Testing potentially more attractive compounds such as prey extracts with the present method and analyzing surface, underwater and acoustic responses would provide further insights on odontocete feeding behavior. It would also provide valuable clues to studies on the anatomical structures involved in their chemosenses. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas supports several populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We provide the first estimates of birth rate and age-class-specific apparent survival rates for the local South Abaco population using data from a long-term (1997–2014) photo-identification (photo-ID) study and use the estimated life history parameters in a population viability analysis (PVA) to predict future population trends. Hurricane events are predicted to become more intense due to climate change but knowledge of how hurricanes may impact cetacean populations is limited. Little Bahama Bank is subject to hurricane activity, so we also investigate the potential impact of hurricanes on calf, juvenile and adult survival. Photo-ID data confirmed the existence of a core adult population with relatively high site fidelity in South Abaco, but also evidence of transient animals. Estimated annual birth rate was 0.278 (95% CI: 0.241–0.337). We found strong support for a decline in apparent survival for all age-classes. Estimated survival declined by 9% in adults (0.941 in 1998, to 0.855 in 2013), 5% in juveniles (0.820 in 2000, to 0.767 in 2013) and 36% in calves (0.970 in 1997, to 0.606 in 2013). Evidence that survival was influenced by repeated hurricane activity leading to increased mortality and/or emigration was stronger for calves and juveniles than for adults. PVA simulations of an assumed isolated South Abaco population showed that declines would lead to extinction within decades, even under the most optimistic scenario. Future work should focus on establishing if South Abaco is part of natural source–sink metapopulation dynamics on Little Bahama Bank by assessing trends in abundance in local populations and establishing how they interact; this will be important for assessing their conservation status in a potentially increasingly changing environment. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Fraser’s dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei) exhibit the capability to restore nearly normal pigmentation after full-thickness wounding. However, the association among melanocytes, melanin and skin pigmentation during wound healing in cetaceans has yet to be addressed. Here, the number of melanocytes and the distribution of melanocytes and melanin in different-colored skin and different wound-healing stages in Fraser’s dolphins were analyzed by using Fontana–Masson staining, immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemical staining. It was noticed that there was the highest number of melanocytes in dark skin and the lowest number of melanocytes in white skin. The appearance of functional melanocytes and full-melanized neoepidermis was observed in the early stage of wound healing in Fraser’s dolphins. Furthermore, the melanocyte number and skin pigmentation and pattern in healed wounds recovered to a similar condition of unwounded skin. This study provides fundamental knowledge of skin repigmentation in cetaceans for further research, and it will be warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of the replenishment of melanocytes and the regulation of melanocyte activity that contribute to the successful repigmentation in cetacean skin wounds. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Competition between fisheries and bottlenose dolphins is a globally relevant conflict given its socioeconomic and ecological implications. Understanding the factors driving the interactions between dolphins and fishery activities is key to the development of appropriate mitigation strategies. Our study aimed to assess whether these interactions are related to the ecological, trophic, and nutritional characteristics of the catch. We used 117 gillnet sets from 48 fishing trips during 2009 – 2010 and 2015 – 2019, which were classified based on the presence or absence of dolphin interactions. These interactions occurred year-round and were documented in 46.1% of the sets, with 14.5% of those showing signs of depredation. The passive acoustic predatory hypothesis, which states that fish species that generate sound are subject to a higher predation intensity by dolphins, was not supported by our data. Also, with the exception of species diversity, ecological parameters such as richness, biomass and CPUE were slightly higher, although not significant in sets with dolphin interaction. Furthermore, during 2015 – 2016, we sampled 123 organisms of 25 representative fish species in the catches and determined the whole fish isotopic composition (δ13C and δ15N), and estimated the nutritional value (i.e., lipid, protein, and energy content) of each species. Isotopic values showed no differences between net settings (with and without interaction), fish habitat, or prey type (potential prey, n= 11 species, vs. non-potential prey, n= 14). However, a preference towards fish from a certain range of thropic levels was evident. All the fish (N= 123) showed significantly higher protein values during the Rainy period, which may be attributed to their reproductive cycles and higher primary productivity. Interestingly, energy contents of the dolphins’ potential prey were also significantly higher during this period. Unexpectedly, protein and energy contents were significantly higher in the fishes caught in the sets without dolphin interaction, but only during the Dry and Windy periods, respectively. Opportunistic feeding habits are well known for bottlenose dolphins, and our results showed that “easy access” to prey will likely prompt interaction with gillnets, regardless of the species composition, biomass, seasonality, preferred habitat, sound production capacity, or nutritional value of the captured fish.

ABSTRACT: The distribution of common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus is associated with environmental factors, which influence morphological adaptations. In the present study, we examined the cranial characteristics of this species from the Pacific Northwest of Mexico to detect the main variations using geometric morphometric analysis. From stable isotope concentrations (δ13C), we identified 24 specimens of the inshore coastal ecotype and 18 of the offshore ecotype. Maturity was determined using the degree of fusion of the maxillae and premaxillae. Allometry was detected in the skull lateral region, indicating that the relationship between shape and size is maintained in adults. After eliminating the allometric effect by discarding the smallest individuals, morphometric comparisons indicated differences between the ecotypes that were associated mainly with the intersection between the frontal bone and zygomatic process, the anteriormost point in the curvature of the zygomatic process, and the meeting of the suture between squamosal and exoccipital bones, with the supramastoid crest to anteriormost in the curvature of the temporal crest of the intersection between the parietal and interparietal. No significant differences were found in the ventral view. The cranial differences between both Tursiops truncatus ecotypes could be mainly associated with the different types of feeding. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment can be used to improve the welfare of dolphins in zoos and aquariums. Bottlenose dolphins under professional care are typically provided with a range of enrichment that has a variety of features and levels of complexity at various frequencies. In the present study, a subset of data from a larger study entitled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study) was used to examine the relationship between activity level and enrichment buoyancy as well as enrichment provisioning schedules. Survey data were collected from accredited zoos and aquariums related to the types of enrichment provided to the dolphins and the frequency and duration they were supplied. Non-invasive bio-logging devices were used to record the dolphin kinematics one day per week over the course of two five-week data collection periods. Activity level related positively with the total duration of time non-stationary enrichment was provided. In addition, providing a larger number of enrichment types each between 26% and 50% of the days in a month (i.e., rotating many different types of enrichment across days on a moderate schedule) was positively related to activity level. Activity level was negatively related to the number of times sinking enrichment was provided. Understanding how the temporal schedule and features of various types of enrichment are related to activity levels will aid in developing progressively more effective enrichment programs. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Alliance formation plays a crucial part in male dolphins’ lives. These partnerships may last for decades or even for a lifetime; thus, partner choice and the maintenance of these relationships are both considered key components of alliance formation. In our previous investigations, pairs of adult male dolphins showed a high success rate in cooperative manipulation of a cognitive enrichment device. Here, we introduced two novel cognitive enrichment devices to the group of five dolphins, facilitating simultaneous actions for not only pairs, but for three or even four dolphins. The devices were made of PVC tubes, fittings and caps equipped with rope handles, creating a three-way (T-shape) and a four-way (TT-shape) device. The devices were filled with fish and ice and were designed to be opened by simultaneous pull of the handles. Both devices were tested in 12 trials (each lasted for 15 min), separately. Only one of the caps could be opened, the others were affixed with the position of the openable cap counter-balanced over the trials. Although the dolphins received no training regarding the manipulation of the devices, they were successful in cooperatively opening the three-way devices in 10/12 of trials (70% by two and 30% by three dolphins) and the four-way devices also in 10/12 trials (50% by two, 40% by three and 10% by four dolphins). The dolphins interacted with the devices during the entire testing time, and this was mostly spent in cooperative play (77% and 56% of the test duration with the three-way and four-way device, respectively). The majority of the cooperative play was observed between one particular pair of dolphins that was temporarily associated with a third or sometimes even with a fourth dolphin. These findings demonstrate the first successful use of multi-partner cooperative enrichment devices, providing information on the social organization of a male dolphin group. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic sequences are commonly observed in many animal taxa. The vast vocal repertoire of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) also includes sequences of multi‐unit rhythmic signals called bray‐call which are still poorly documented, both functionally and geographically. This study aimed to (1) describe, classify, and characterize series of bray‐call recorded in two sites of the Mediterranean basin (Rome—Tyrrhenian Sea and Mazara del Vallo— Strait of Sicily) and (2) investigate for the existence of possible geographic differences. The acoustic analysis identified 13 different sequence types, only two detected in both study areas. The Sørensen– Dice index revealed a low degree of similarity between the sequence repertoire of the two common bottlenose dolphin sub‐populations, with the Tyrrhenian being more diversified and complex than the Sicilian one. The acoustic parameters also showed variability between the study area. Different variants of the main acoustic elements composing the bray‐call sequences were detected in the Tyrrhenian Sea only. The Markov‐chain model demonstrated that the transition probability between acoustic elements is not uniform, with specific combinations of elements having a higher probability of occurrence. These new findings on common bottlenose dolphin bray‐call sequences highlight the structural complexity of these vocalizations and suggest addressing future research on the context of emissions and the possible function(s) of such acoustic arrangements. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphin is an endangered marine mammal species; therefore, there is an urgent need to take protective measures, especially in terms of population breeding and evolution. To address this, it is important to understand the age group structure of populations. Unlike biological individual identification and biological object detection based on pattern classification methods, a new age-group classification (AGC) method was developed to classify Irrawaddy dolphins into three age groups: older, middle-aged, and juvenile. Taking into account the relation between the dorsal fin shape features of Irrawaddy dolphins and their age, the AGC method constructed several dorsal fin geometric morphological features, such as leading edge length and dorsal fin height, using edge extraction and curve fitting of dolphin images. After performing a multicollinearity test on these features, nine effective features were obtained. A model was then trained to classify Irrawaddy dolphins according to their age groups. The experimental results demonstrated that the AGC method has a high classification accuracy of 80.20% for older dolphins. In contrast to individual identification and object detection methods, the proposed AGC method facilitates the analysis of population structure stability and dynamics by classifying Irrawaddy dolphins by age. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Riverine cetaceans are threatened globally by increasing anthropogenic impacts, and the Yangtze river dolphin Lipotes vexillifer is already extinct. The Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis is widely distributed, but is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Drowning in gillnets and being hunted for fish bait are probably the main causes of its decline. A long-term (25-year) study of the biology and ecology of I. geoffrensis in and near the Mamirauá Reserve in Amazonas state, Brazil, has produced estimates of survival and reproductive rates based on the individual recognition of > 650 animals. Concurrently, monthly standardized counts of dolphins along a fixed transect in the Reserve over 22 years demonstrated a sustained, profound decline. In this study we tested whether the measured rate of population decline is consistent with population parameters estimated from independent data, using population viability analysis. With the known parameters as input, programme Vortex predicted population extinction in all scenarios and a 95% loss of dolphins within 50 years. With default parameters, the model predicted a 5.5% annual decline, which is consistent with that observed. We conclude that the Amazon river dolphin population is in severe decline because of human pressures, even in one of the better protected parts of its range. Unless the accidental and deliberate killing of this species is rapidly reduced, it is highly likely that the Amazon river dolphin will follow its Yangtze counterpart to extinction.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis remains difficult to diagnose in animals. Laboratory-based assays are far less developed than those for human medicine, and only few studies have been completed to validate their utility in routine veterinary diagnostics. To overcome the current limitations, veterinarians and researchers have to propose alternative methods including extrapolating from human diagnostic tools and using innovative technology. In the present overview, two specific examples were complementarily addressed in penguins and dolphins to illustrate how is challenging the diagnosis of aspergillosis in animals. Specific focus will be made on the novel application of simple testing in blood based on serological assays or protein electrophoresis and on the new information garnered from metabolomics/proteomics to discover potential new biomarkers. In conclusion, while the diagnostic approach of aspergillosis in veterinary medicine cannot be directly taken from options developed for human medicine, it can certainly serve as inspiration.

ABSTRACT: Vocal interactions are intrinsic features of social groups and can play a pivotal role in social bonding.1,2 Dunbar's social bonding hypothesis posits that vocal exchanges evolved to “groom at a distance” when social groups became too large or complex for individuals to devote time to physical bonding activities.1,3 Tests of this hypothesis in non-human primates, however, suggest that vocal exchanges occur between more strongly bonded individuals that engage in higher grooming rates4–7 and thus do not provide evidence for replacement of physical bonding. Here, we combine data on social bond strength, whistle exchange frequency, and affiliative contact behavior rates to test this hypothesis in wild male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, who form multi-level alliances that cooperate over access to females.8–10 We show that, although whistle exchanges are more likely to occur within the core alliance, they occur more frequently between those males that share weaker social bonds, i.e., between core allies that spend less time together, while the opposite occurs for affiliative physical contact behavior. This suggests that vocal exchanges function as a low-cost mechanism for male dolphins that spend less time in close proximity and engage in fewer affiliative contact behaviors to reinforce and maintain their valuable alliance relationships. Our findings provide new evidence outside of the primate lineage that vocal exchanges serve a bonding function and reveal that, as the social bonding hypothesis originally suggested, vocal exchanges can function as a replacement of physical bonding activities for individuals to maintain their important social relationships. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Swiss Upper Marine Molasse (OMM) documents a transgression event dated to around 21 to 17 million years in which dolphin and other vertebrate remains have been reported. We revised the whole cetacean (whales and dolphins)OMMassemblage available in main collections, focusing on the identification and interpretation of periotics (bone that contains the inner ear). Periotics are rare, but they provide the richest taxonomic information in the sample and hint to environmental associations. Micro-computerized tomography allowed the reconstruction of bony labyrinths for comparisons and environmental interpretations. Three families are represented by periotics: Kentriodontidae, Squalodelphinidae and Physeteridae. The cetacean taxonomic composition of the Swiss OMM reinforces biogeographical patterns reported for the Mediterranean and Paratethys during the Burdigalian at a regional scale and the Calvert cetacean fauna of the northwest Atlantic at oceanic scale. © 2022 Aguirre-Fernández et al.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean bycatch is increasing worldwide and poses a threat to the conservation of several delphinids. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is frequently involved in bycatch incidents, due to its coastal distribution and opportunistic behaviour. The acoustic behaviour of cetaceans during death-related events is a largely unexplored topic. During an acoustic monitoring survey of the bottlenose dolphin population inhabiting the Gulf of Catania (Ionian Sea), we documented the entangling and subsequent death of a sub-adult male in a fishing net. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the vocal behaviour of the pod of bottlenose dolphins during the event. We identified a total of 720 vocalisations in a timespan of 138 min, including 436 signature whistles, 51 non-signature whistles, and 233 burst pulses. We recorded high vocal activity, with a peak characterised by emission rates of 36 signature whistles per minute and 70 burst pulses per minute. Although future studies are required, our results show massive vocal activity during net entangling, characterised by a significant emission of signature whistles and burst pulses, including bray series of gulps and squeaks. Therefore, we suggest that developing tools for automatically detecting the peaks of these sound types could be helpful in recognising bycatch events, in order to better quantify the impact of professional fishing on small cetaceans. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Research data on milk composition in cetaceans are scattered and fragmentary. This paper analyses the gross and mineral composition, the fatty acids profile and the fat globule size of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) colostrum and milk at early lactation. The milk samplings were carried out on three lactating female of bottlenose dolphins at the 1st, 4-5 and 20- 42 day post partum. High percentages of dry matter (51.88%), fat (26.08%) and protein (13.83%) were found in the colostrum on the first day, while there was a tendency for these components to decrease in the milk. The average diameter the milk fat globule (7.07 μm) of this species was assessed for the first time. The milk was rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which were more than twice compared to the saturated fatty acids (unsaturated / saturated ratio = 2.6). The main fatty acids of dolphin milk were C16: 0, C16:1 n-7, C18: 1n-9, C20: 1 n-11 C20: 5 and C22:6n-3. Several FA tended to increase from colostrum to milk: C12: 0 doubled, C20: 1 n-7 and C22:1 n-11 tripled, C20: 1 n-9 quintupled in later milk samples. Differently, other FA tended to decrease: C18: 3 n-3 was approximately 4 times lower and C24: 0 and C24: 1 halved in milk compared to colostrum. In conclusion, this paper contributes to the knowledge of the nutritional value of milk from bottlenose dolphins maintained under human care. Higher content of nutritional components such as fat and protein was found in the first day colostrum compared to milk. Moreover, the findings of this study highlight abundance of unsaturated fatty acids and large sized milk fat globules in dolphin milk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Phthalates are chemical esters used to enhance desirable properties of plastics, personal care, and cleaning products. Phthalates have shown ubiquitous environmental contamination due to their abundant use and propensity to leach from products to which they are added. Following exposure, phthalates are rapidly metabolized and excreted through urine. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled from Sarasota Bay, Florida, have demonstrated prevalent di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure indicated by detectable urinary mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) concentrations. Widespread exposure is concerning due to evidence of endocrine disruption from human and laboratory studies. To better understand how phthalate exposure may impact dolphin health, correlations between relevant hormone levels and detectable urinary MEHP concentrations were examined. Hormone concentrations measured via blood serum samples included triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), and free thyroxine (FT4). Urinary MEHP concentrations were detected in 56% of sampled individuals (n = 50; mean = 8.13 ng/mL; s.d. = 15.99 ng/mL). Adult female and male FT4 was significantly correlated with urinary MEHP concentrations (adult female Kendall’s tau = 0.36, p = 0.04; adult male Kendall’s tau = 0.42, p = 0.02). Evidence from this study suggests DEHP exposure may be impacting thyroid hormone homeostasis. Cumulative effects of other stressors and resultant endocrine impacts are unknown. Further research is warranted to understand potential health implications associated with this relationship. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Photographic-identification (photo-ID) of bottlenose dolphins using individually distinctive features on the dorsal fin is a well-established and useful tool for tracking individuals; however, this method can be labor-intensive, especially when dealing with large catalogs and/or infrequently surveyed populations. Computer vision algorithms have been developed that can find a fin in an image, characterize the features of the fin, and compare the fin to a catalog of known individuals to generate a ranking of potential matches based on dorsal fin similarity. We examined if and how researchers use computer vision systems in their photo-ID process and developed an experiment to evaluate the performance of the most commonly used, recently developed, systems to date using a long-term photo-ID database of known individuals curated by the Chicago Zoological Society’s Sarasota Dolphin Research Program. Survey results obtained for the “Rise of the machines – Application of automated systems for matching dolphin dorsal fins: current status and future directions” workshop held at the 2019 World Marine Mammal Conference indicated that most researchers still rely on manual methods for comparing unknown dorsal fin images to reference catalogs of known individuals. Experimental evaluation of the finFindR R application, as well as the CurvRank, CurvRank v2, and finFindR implementations in Flukebook suggest that high match rates can be achieved with these systems, with the highest match rates found when only good to excellent quality images of fins with average to high distinctiveness are included in the matching process: for the finFindR R application and the CurvRank and CurvRank v2 algorithms within Flukebook more than 98.92% of correct matches were in the top 50-ranked positions, and more than 91.94% of correct matches were returned in the first ranked position. Our results offer the first comprehensive examination into the performance and accuracy of computer vision algorithms designed to assist with the photo-ID process of bottlenose dolphins and can be used to build trust by researchers hesitant to use these systems. Based on our findings and discussions from the “Rise of the Machines” workshop we provide recommendations for best practices for using computer vision systems for dorsal fin photo-ID.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decade, national authorities and European administrations have made great efforts to establish methodological standards for the assessment of underwater continuous noise, especially under the requirements set by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Through the MSFD implementation across EU Member States Marine Reporting Units (MRUs), it is intended to establish the Good Environmental Status (GES) whether it is achieved or not. The evaluation of the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) at the local or regional scale for 1/3 octave band of 63 Hz and 125 Hz and the identification of long temporary trends were considered to be a priority due to the valuable information they can offer in relation to continuous low-frequency noise. Nevertheless, the methodology to determine threshold values from which to evaluate the GES has become difficult to define, and new approaches and considerations are currently being discussed by groups of experts, such as the technical subgroup on underwater acoustics (TGnoise) and regional commissions (e.g., OSPAR). This work presents a methodology to perform the assessment of a given area, providing a risk index that is related to potential appearance of masking effect due to the underwater noise produced by marine traffic. The risk index is hinged on the calculation of area under curves defined by the density of animals and a variable related to underwater noise SPL, defined as percentage of communication distance reduction. At this stage, the methodology presented does not consider physiological or behavioral mechanisms to overcome the masking by animals. The methodology presented has been applied to the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the ABIES—NOR marine demarcation to illustrate the possible use of risk-based models to manage marine areas related to human pressures, such as marine traffic, with the potential adverse impact on a given species (e.g., masking effect). © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The hydrodynamic performance of the virtual underwater vehicle under self-yaw is investigated numerically in this paper, we aim to explore the fluid laws behind this plane motion achieved by the bionic flexibility, especially the spanwise flexibility of the caudal fin. The kinematics of the chordwise flexible body and the spanwise flexible caudal fin are explored through dynamic mesh technology and user-defined functions (UDF). The 3-D Navier-Stokes equations are applied to simulate the viscid fluid surrounding the bionic dolphin. The study focuses on quantitative problems about the fluid dynamics behind the specific motion law, including speed of movement, energy loss and working efficiency. The current results show that the self-yaw can be composed of two motions, autonomous propulsion and active steering. In addition, the degree of the flexible caudal fin can produce different yaw effects. The chordwise phase difference Ф is dominant in the propulsion function, while the spanwise phase difference δ has a more noticeable effect on the steering function. The pressure distribution on the surface of the dolphin and the wake vortex generated in the flow field reasonably reveal the evolution of self-yaw. It properly turns out that the dolphin can combine the spanwise flexible caudal fin and the chordwise flexible body to achieve self-yaw motion. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Marine species from the Gulf of Mexico often have higher mercury (Hg) concentrations than conspecifics in the Atlantic Ocean. Spatial differences in Hg sources, environmental conditions, and microbial communities influence both Hg methylation rates and the bioavailability of Hg to organisms at the base of the food web. Mercury bioaccumulates within organisms and biomagnifies in marine food webs, and therefore reaches the greatest concentrations in long-lived marine carnivores, such as dolphins. In this study, we explored whether differences in trophic position and foraging habitat among bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) contributed to the observed variation in skin total Hg (THg) concentrations. Using the δ13C and δ34S values in dolphin skin, we assigned deceased stranded dolphins from Florida (FL; n = 29) and Louisiana (LA; n = 72) to habitats (estuarine, barrier island, and coastal) east and west of the Mississippi River Delta (MRD). We estimated the mean trophic position of dolphins from each habitat using δ15N values from stranded dolphin skin and tissues of primary consumers taken from the literature following a Bayesian framework. Finally, we compared trophic positions and THg concentrations among dolphins from each habitat, accounting for sex and body length. Estimated marginal mean THg concentrations (μg/g dry weight) were greatest in dolphins assigned to the coastal habitat and estuarine habitats east of the MRD (range: 2.59–4.81), and lowest in dolphins assigned to estuarine and barrier island habitats west of the MRD (range: 0.675–0.993). On average, dolphins from habitats with greater THg concentrations also had higher estimated trophic positions, except for coastal dolphins. Our results suggest that differences in trophic positions and foraging habitats contribute to spatial variability in skin THg concentrations among nGoM bottlenose dolphins, however, the relative influence of these factors on THg concentrations are not easily partitioned. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recently diverged taxa are often characterized by high rates of hybridization, which can complicate phylogenetic reconstruction. For this reason, the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of dolphins are still not very well resolved; the question of whether the genera Tursiops and Stenella are monophyletic is especially controversial. Here, we performed re-sequencing of six dolphin genomes and combined them with eight previously published dolphin SRA datasets and six whole-genome datasets to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of dolphins and test the monophyly hypothesis of Tursiops and Stenella. Phylogenetic reconstruction with the maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of sliding window trees, produced a concordant and well-supported tree. Our studies support the non-monophyletic status of Tursiops and Stenella because the species referred these genera do not form exclusive monophyletic clades. This suggests that the current taxonomy of both genera might not reflect their evolutionary history and may underestimate their diversity. A four-taxon D-statistic (ABBA-BABA) test, five-taxon DFOIL test, and tree-based PhyloNet analyses all showed extensive gene flow across dolphin species, which could explain the instability in resolving phylogenetic relationship of oceanic dolphins with different and limited markers. This study could be a good case to demonstrate how genomic data can reveal complex speciation and phylogeny in rapidly radiating animal groups. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Levels of boat traffic in coastal seas have been steadily increasing in many parts of the world, introducing pressures on marine wildlife through disturbance. The appropriate management of human activities is important not only to preserve wildlife, but also for the local communities that depend on ecotourism for employment and their economy. This study presents further insight into bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) responses to boats in New Quay Bay (West Wales) within the Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation. This region is heavily dependent on wildlife tourism, and marine traffic is regulated through a long-standing Code of Conduct. Based on a long-term dataset spanning the months of April to October and the years 2010–2018, the study found that compliance to a code of human behaviour increased dolphin positive responses towards boats. Dolphin responses to individual named boats and to different boat types were examined in greater detail. Speed boats, small motorboats, and kayaks were found to break the code most often, resulting in higher rates of negative response by dolphins. Visitor passenger boats formed the majority of boat traffic in the area, and showed greater compliance than other general recreational crafts. Suggestions are made for the better protection of the coastal dolphin population, as well as the role that citizen science can play to help achieve this goal through working directly with wildlife trip boats and the recruitment of local observers. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Hybrid cetaceans occur in both captive and natural environments. This study is the first to describe the external morphological and genetic characterizations of natural intrageneric hybridization between the common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, T. aduncus, in Japanese waters. In November 2019, a stray dolphin was seen in Moriura Bay, Wakayama, Japan, and was a male that measured 241.5 cm in body length in July 2020, after an incidental catch in February 2020. Moderate speckles in the genital area of the dolphin were observed, which is a characteristic of T. aduncus. The dolphin had 22-23 pairs of teeth in each jaw, a quantity consistent for both species. The length of the rostrum and the size of flippers were within the range of T. aduncus. The mitochondrial DNA D-loop region haplotype was 99% homology with those from T. aduncus found in Chinese and Japanese waters. Microsatellite analysis revealed that the dolphin contained ratios of approximately 50% of both T. truncatus and T. aduncus lineages; the dolphin could therefore be an F1 hybrid between a female T. aduncus and a male T. truncatus. Further genetic studies are required to elucidate the origin of this hybrid dolphin.  © The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei, is one of the most threatened cetaceans in the Southwestern Atlantic. Within their limited coastal range off Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, franciscanas face human activities, including artisanal gillnet fishing and coastal development. A lack of information on ranging patterns, population structure, and behavior for informing management led to efforts to develop and apply approaches to tag franciscanas in Argentina (Bahía Samborombón [BS], Bahía San Blas [BSB]) and Brazil (Baía Babitonga [BB]) during 2005–2013. Findings from VHF tags deployed in BS in 2005 during feasibility tests for catching and handling franciscanas for tagging suggested residency over periods of weeks. Subsequently, satellite-linked tags confirmed patterns of residency at each site. Home range size varied, with ranges of 5–7 km2 for BB, 51–312 km2 for BS, and 49–1,014 km2 for BSB. Diving patterns varied across sites, with the animals using the entire water column, exposing them to fishing nets regardless of the depth at which the nets were set. Tracking durations and follow-up observations indicated that this research approach is useful for studies of franciscanas. Small, definable ranges facilitate relating specific geographically based threats to appropriate population units, increasing the potential for effective conservation. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A division of labor with role specialization is defined as individuals specializing in a subtask during repetitions of a group task. While this behavior is ubiquitous among humans, there are only four candidates found among non-eusocial mammals: lions, mice, chimpanzees, and bottlenose dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins in the Cedar Keys, Florida, engage in role specialized “driver-barrier feeding”, where a “driver” dolphin herds mullet towards “barrier” dolphins. Thus trapped, the mullet leap out of the water where the dolphins catch them in air. To investigate whether dolphins use acoustic cues or signals to coordinate this behavior, vocalizations were recorded before and during driver-barrier feeding. Results of fine-scale audio and video analysis during 81 events by 7 different driver individuals suggest that barrier animals coordinate movements during these events by cueing on the driver's echolocation. Analysis of dolphin whistle occurrence before driving events versus another foraging technique, which does not involve role specialization, revealed significantly higher whistle production immediately prior to driver-barrier events. Possible whistle functions include signaling motivation, recruiting individuals to participate, and/or behavioral coordination. While the use of cues and signals is common in humans completing role-specialized tasks, this is the first study to investigate the use of vocalizations in the coordination of a role-specialized behavior in a non-human mammal. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Streptococcosis is an infectious bacterial disease of both homeotherms and poikilotherms. Among the Streptococcus species that infect marine animals, Streptococcus agalactiae has the broadest host spectrum, including different aquatic organisms in freshwater and marine environments. The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is categorized as Endangered in the Mediterranean Sea. There are few reports of a streptococcal infection of D. delphis, caused by Streptococcus phocae and Streptococcus iniae. Here we report the isolation and identification of S. agalactiae in a stranded, wild male common dolphin that was found dead in September 2020 on the seashore next to the city of Bat-Yam, Israel. The carcass was fresh with a moderate nutritional status and with no apparent fishing gear or other anthropogenic-related signs. A post-mortem examination did not reveal an apparent cause of death, but further laboratory analysis demonstrated a S. agalactiae bacterial presence in urine, lungs and pericardial fluid that was characterized as type Ia-ST7 by whole genome sequencing. Interestingly, this isolate was found to be almost identical to another isolate recently recovered from a wild sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) in the same area in Israel, the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

ABSTRACT: In the order of cetacean, the ability to detect bioelectric fields has, up to now, only been demonstrated in the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) and is suggested to facilitate benthic feeding. As this foraging strategy has also been reported for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), we studied electroreception in this species by combining an anatomical analysis of “vibrissal crypts” as potential electroreceptors from neonate and adult animals with a behavioral experiment. In the latter, four bottlenose dolphins were trained on a go/no-go paradigm with acoustic stimuli and afterward tested for stimulus generalization within and across modalities using acoustic, optical, mechanical, and electric stimuli. While neonates still possess almost complete vibrissal follicles including a hair shaft, hair papilla, and cavernous sinus, adult bottlenose dolphins lack these features. Thus, their “vibrissal crypts” show a similar postnatal morphological transformation from a mechanoreceptor to an electroreceptor as in Sotalia. However, innervation density was high and almost equal in both, neonate as well as adult animals. In the stimulus generalization tests the dolphins transferred the go/no-go response within and across modalities. Although all dolphins responded spontaneously to the first presentation of a weak electric field, only three of them showed perfect transfer in this modality by responding continuously to electric field amplitudes of 1.5 mV cm−1, successively reduced to 0.5 mV cm−1. Electroreception can explain short-range prey detection in crater-feeding bottlenose dolphins. The fact that this is the second odontocete species with experimental evidence for electroreception suggests that it might be widespread in this marine mammal group. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Persian Gulf is positioned in the heart of the Middle East as one of the most critical water bodies. Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) are distributed in nearshore waters and are therefore highly vulnerable to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. To our knowledge, there is a little information and data available about habitat use and abundance of this endangered species in Iranian waters. In the present study, baseline data about population size and site fidelity of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins in the Dayer-Nakhiloo Marine National Park in Northern Persian Gulf, Iran, has been explored for the first time. From March 2014 to December 2018, 127 boat-based surveys and 6436 km of survey effort were conducted. Overall, 127 groups of humpback dolphins were observed on 62% of the surveys. Humpback dolphin group size ranged from 1 to 14 individuals (mean 5.8 ± SE 0.3). Abundance estimates were calculated and fitted with open population models. Thirty (95% CI 22–38) humpback dolphins were estimated to inhabit the study area. There was a lack of seasonality in the occurrence of humpback dolphins and strong site fidelity within the Dayer-Nakhiloo Marine National Park. Most of the identified individuals used the study zone regularly (79.5%), while a smaller number were present less often. The results of this study provide important baseline information about humpback dolphin ecology in an area subject to significant anthropogenic pressures which can help to take effective conservation and management measures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The spatial–temporal distribution of cetacean species often overlaps with fishing practices in the Mediterranean, having direct and indirect consequences. This is the first long-term study focusing on the effects of fisheries on the behavior of T. truncatus in Montenegro. Focal group scan sampling was used during surveys between September 2016 and August 2020 to create transition probability matrices using first-order Markov chains for behavioral states in both control (absence of fishery practices) and impact chains (presence of fishery practices). Despite the low number of dolphin-fishery interactions in Montenegro, results revealed that the behavioral budgets of T. truncatus were significantly altered both for commercial and artisanal fisheries. However, the magnitude of the threat differed between practices, with commercial fisheries altering three out of the four behaviors in the behavioral budget while artisanal fisheries altered just one. Significant behavioral changes due to disturbance can have negative consequences on the energy budget of individuals and while the Montenegrin fishing fleet is currently limited to 224 vessels, the significant effects already witnessed are concerning for Montenegrin bottlenose dolphins. To develop in-situ mitigation strategies, there is a clear need to better understand the impact that fisheries interactions have on these individuals. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalog.

ABSTRACT: The Risso's dolphin, Grampus griseus, is a deep-sea cetacean with a predominantly teuthophagous diet. Its distribution in the northwest Mediterranean is generally in deeper waters, but there is little information on diet or feeding areas. To extend knowledge of the diet of G. griseus, the stomach contents of six stranded Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea were analyzed. A total of 578 cephalopod beaks (166 uppers and 392 lowers) were found, identified as 386 individuals from 19 different species of Coleoidea cephalopods, one Sepiolida, eight Octopoda, and ten species belonging to the Order Oegopsida. This adds six species of cephalopods to those previously recorded in the Mediterranean Sea: Rondeletiola minor, Eledone moschata, Scaeurgus unicirrhus, Bathypolypus sponsalis, Pteroctopus tetracirrhus and Taonius pavo. In this study the most abundant prey family was Histioteuthidae. In addition, based on the available literature, the diet of 39 Risso's dolphins was reviewed in Mediterranean waters. The abundance of cephalopod species in the diet of these specimens was compared according to genus, geographical area, season, and age. The habitat of the prey of G. griseus was reviewed, suggesting a teuthophagous diet in this area. This study helps to identify both the prey species and the areas where prey are available in the northwest Mediterranean, which are key factors in establishing the limits and regulations of the “Northwest Mediterranean Sea, Slope and Canyon IMMA System” (Important Areas for Marine Mammals) proposed by the Working Group on Marine Mammal Protected Areas (MMPATF - IUCN). © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Context: Identifying the habitat preferences and core areas of Inia geoffrensis activity is essential to designing effective strategies for the management and conservation of Amazon River dolphins and their habitats in the Colombian Amazonas River and Orinoco basin. Objectives: Quantify the differential use of habitat that Amazon River dolphins exhibit and identify core areas of activity during seasons of rising waters in the Colombian Amazonas River and five major rivers in the Orinoco basin. Methods: Based on processed satellite images from Landsat 8 (2018–2021), we classified habitat types used by I. geoffrensis as reported in the literature as follows: (1) main river, (2) confluences, (3) tributaries, (4) channels, (5) islands, (6) bays, and (7) lagoons. We combined this dataset with GPS location data obtained from 17 tagged Amazon River dolphins to quantify the proportion of habitat types used. We used kernel density estimate (KDE) analysis to identify both areas used (K95) and core areas (K50) in the habitat types for the satellite-monitored individuals. Results: Satellite tracking of I. geoffrensis individuals reported 16,098 locations classified into seven habitat types. For the analyzed period (rising waters) main habitat types used were as follow: (1) main river (n = 9144, 57%); (2) confluences (n = 932, 6%); (3) tributaries (n = 1423, 9%); (4) channels (n = 1597, 10%); (5) islands (n = 738, 5%); (6) bays (n = 1096, 7%), and (7) lagoons (n = 1168, 7%). Home range size (K95) for the satellite-monitored I. geoffrensis individuals ranged from 6 to 116 km2 (mean = 40 ± 33); and the largest core areas (K50) or core area of activity were recorded in the main river, confluences, channels, bays, lagoons, and tributaries. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the importance of spatial ecology analysis of Amazon River dolphins for the definition of protected areas, quantifying the use of ecosystems within these areas, and the location of priority areas for the implementation of management plans for the species and habitats. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: On November 5th, 2015, the Fundão dam collapsed in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, releasing millions of cubic meters of mud containing mining residue into the Doce River. Two weeks later, the mud arrived to the marine environment, triggering changes in franciscana dolphin habitat, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Franciscana Management Area Ia. This is an isolated population of the most endangered cetacean species in the South Atlantic Ocean. Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) may pose a threat to this endangered population because of their endocrine disrupting properties. Hence, this study sought to determine if there were differences in the bioaccumulation profile of OHC (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB, HCHs, PBDEs, PBEB, HBBZ and MeO-BDEs) in franciscana dolphins before and after dam collapse and to build a temporal trend. Blubber of 33 stranded individuals was collected in Espírito Santo state for organohalogen assessment between 2003 and 2019. Differences were found between franciscana dolphins collected prior to and after the disaster. Additionally, significant temporal trends for organochlorine pesticides and natural and anthropogenic organobromine were detected. The increase in pesticide concentrations after 2015 is suggestive of their reavailability in the environment. The decline in organobromine over time could be due to their debromination in the marine environment and alterations in the composition of their natural producers. PCBs remained stable during the period of the study. Our findings show an increase in endocrine disruptor concentrations, which is of great concern for this endangered population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In India’s Indo-Gangetic plains, river flows are strongly altered by dams, barrages and water diversions for irrigation, urban supply, hydropower production and flood control. Human demands for freshwater are likely to intensify with climatic and socio-economic changes, exacerbating trade-offs between different sustainable development goals (SDGs) dependent on freshwater (e.g. SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG11 and SDG15). Freshwater ecosystems and endangered aquatic species are not explicitly addressed in the SDGs, but only nested as targets within SDG6 and SDG15. Thus, there is high risk that decisions to advance other SDGs may overlook impacts on them. In this study, we link a water resource systems model and a forecast extinction risk model to analyze how alternative conservation strategies in the regulated Beas River (India) affect the likelihood of survival of the only remaining population of endangered Indus River Dolphins (IRD) in India in the face of climate change-induced impacts on river hydrology and human water demands, explicitly accounting for potential trade-offs between related SDGs. We find that the frequency of low flow released from the main reservoir may increase under some climate change scenarios, significantly affecting the IRD population. The strongest trade-offs exist between the persistence of IRD, urban water supply and hydropower generation. The establishment of ecologically informed reservoir releases combined with IRD population supplementation enhances the probability of survival of the IRD and is compatible with improving the status of relevant SDGs. This will require water managers, conservation scientists, and other stakeholders to continue collaborating to develop holistic water management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals in subtropical coastal habitats are sentinels of the health of the ecosystem and offer important ecosystem services. They rely on prey that pursues feeding opportunities, while both avoid unfavorable conditions. In many cases, these predator-prey dynamics fluctuate seasonally and are regulated by lunar, tidal, and/or diel cycles (hour). However, these rhythmical patterns may vary under different seasonal conditions. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Ensenada de La Paz in Baja California Sur, Mexico, were detected acoustically over the course of an annual cycle on 21 separate occasions, covering 640 h from June 2017 to May 2019. The presence of bottlenose dolphins was examined using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) including variables that are related directly to their habitat (direct variables: hour, distance, depth) and to their prey (indirect variables: SST,moon phase and tides). Seasonal differences in the presence of bottlenose dolphins were influenced more by indirect variables (explained deviance: 34.8% vs. 37.7%). Hourly acoustic detections occurred less frequently when SST exceeded 27.4 °C (Aug-End of Nov.) and more frequently at moderate temperatures (22.7 °C to 26.3 °C) in May through July. Moreover, bottlenose dolphins were detected more frequently during waning and new moon phases, at the onset of flood and ebb tides, and during day (04:00 to 20:00). The seasonal differences in acoustic detections rates were highlighted by the global GAM and hierarchical clustering. The strong seasonal pattern indicated possible interactions with rhythmic pattern of bottlenose dolphins. Four candidate variables (SST, moon, tide, and hour) were tested for plausible interaction terms additional to their individual consideration, out of which only hour changed significantly between seasons. The patterns of presence likely increase feeding opportunities or may favor other behaviors such as socializing, resting, or nursing. These might prove responsible for the distinct occurrence and hourly patterns of bottlenose dolphins. © 2022 Gauger et al.

ABSTRACT: Epimeletic behavior has been reported in various species of cetaceans and sometimes in wild populations during vessel-based surveys. Epimeletic behavior in cetaceans involves complex social interactions which have been described using observational and acoustic studies. The recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology allowed its application in wildlife research and frequently in cetaceans in conjunction with vessel-based surveys. This article is the first report of intraspecific epimeletic behavior of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Hong Kong waters using a combination of UAV-and vessel-based photography. Using both techniques, we were able to observe and qualitative analyze the individual body condition, group behavior, and swimming pattern during the epimeletic event. This study highlighted that UAVs can be used to observe the complex social behaviors and interactions of cetaceans from the aerial angle while keeping a minimal level of disturbance to the animals. Aerial footage can also be quantitatively analyzed to provide further insights on the group behaviors of cetaceans. The application allows efficient assessment of health, behavior, and ecology of wild animals, offering valuable opportunities for researchers working on free-ranging populations. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Sexing cetaceans typically requires extended periods of observation or expensive molecular methods. An alternative approach using photo-identification may provide a cost-effective, noninvasive method for assigning a sex to free-ranging individuals. We investigated two methods for predicting the sex of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from Namibia, using the rate of change in dorsal fin (1) trailing edge marks or (2) surface features (scarring and lesions) and binary logistic regression models. Our results suggest animals with frequent and extensive changes to dorsal edge marks, or a high number/proportion of the dorsal fin covered in surface features are likely male, while those with little to no changes in dorsal edge marks or low numbers/proportion of surface features are likely female. Both sex prediction models performed reasonably well (accuracy: edge marks: 100%, surface features: 83%), with a high degree of consensus between models in sex predictions (78.6%). Our models are straightforward to implement and robust for the study population, providing useful insights into individuals' sex and population demographics. This reliable, inexpensive, and minimally invasive framework for assigning sex could be widely applicable, if population-specific information of known sex individuals is included, due to the variable social systems and behaviors exhibited by Tursiops spp. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: In Brazil, dolphins’ body parts are commonly used as traditional amulets, named as love-charms, while dolphins’ teeth are commercialized in handcrafted necklaces and bracelets. Recent studies on forensic genetics confirmed the Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, as the principal target of the love-charms trading, with specimens incidentally captured in gillnets suggested as the primary source. As additional support for these investigations, we characterized tooth morphotypes and ages of dolphins used in the construction of traditional crafts, with the main objective of detecting the dolphin species and population groups most affected by this trade. Teeth collected from necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, sold in public markets from three major cities of Northern and Northeastern Brazil (Belém = 99, São Luís = 4, and Fortaleza =15), were analyzed using four morphological measurements: tooth total length (TL), root diameter (RD), crown length (CL), and cingulum diameter (CID). An unweighted pair group method using arithmetic means (UPGMA), with Euclidean distances as a measure of dissimilarity, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to detect tooth morphotypes in the samples. Ages were obtained by counting the growth layer groups (GLGs) deposited in dentine. Two different groups of teeth were detected presumably belonging to the species Sotalia guianensis and S. fluviatilis. Handicrafts showed a diverse age composition, ranging from 2 to 30 years, with a multimodal distribution (Mean =11 ± 7 SD, Median = 10, Mode = 4, 8, 19), similar to dolphin populations affected by fishery interaction. Results suggested that juveniles individuals and adults younger than 20 years, from both Sotalia species, probably incidentally captured, are the principal source of handicrafts, and raise concern about the greater vulnerability of young age categories presented in this trade.

ABSTRACT: Coexistence among sympatric species requires a certain degree of resource partitioning. In the Mexican South Pacific, information regarding the coexistence of Stenella attenuata (SA) and Stenella longirostris (SL) is lacking. Stable isotope analyses (δ15N and δ13C) were conducted to assess the differences in feeding habits to infer trophic position and amplitude as well as habitat use, based on Bayesian inference and a random forest (RF) classifier. Potential trophic relationships with other species were assessed by Bayesian mixing models. Feeding segregation between species was mainly based on carbon sources (δ13C: p(SA > SL) = 100%, RF Gini Impurity = 80%). Moreover, SA (n = 22) presented a broader isotopic niche than that of SL (n = 25; SIBER Bayesian Standard Ellipse areas = 0.91‰2 vs. 0.77‰2) with a 33% overlap, suggesting that SA uses more coastal habitats than SL. The most relevant prey species were the mesopelagic fish Benthosema panamense and the epipelagic fish Hyporhamphus naos (~50%), although B. panamense was more related to SL than SA: p(%SL > %SA) = 76.6%. The trophic positions were 4.0 (SA) and 3.8 (SL). Our results provide evidence of resource partitioning within a potential foraging ground for both dolphin species. © 2022 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Increasing human activities are altering marine ecosystems, which may have ramifications for predator feeding ecology and, thus, the degree of contaminant exposure. We conducted the first investigation of spatiotemporal trends for nine alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs) and their relations with dietary variations in 128 humpback dolphins that were stranded along the northern South China Sea during 2003-2020. We detected the highest levels of seven major AHFRs in humpback dolphins compared with the results reported in cetaceans globally, indicating high AHFR contamination in coastal regions of South China. Dolphins that were stranded near urban regions generally contained higher AHFR concentrations than those that were stranded near rural areas, mirroring the environmental trends of AHFRs occurring in this area. Model-generated diet estimates suggested that humpback dolphins have reduced their consumption of high trophic-level prey in recent years, likely attributable to overfishing-induced prey decline in this region. After adjusting AHFR concentrations due to diet changes, the temporal trends of AHFR contamination in humpback dolphins were only slightly altered. Our results suggest that increasing discharges of AHFRs into the South China Sea during the 2000s and 2010s may have had a greater influence on AHFR trends in humpback dolphins than dietary shifts. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: In the waters off Japan, the patterns of the Kuroshio Current (KC) and its bifurcations are highly variable, which significantly affect the physical and biological environments. Knowledge about species' habitats of marine apex predators such as cetaceans and their variability is fundamental to understand not only their population structures but also their ecosystem structures related through bottom-up and top-down trophic linkages. In dynamic ocean environments, however, such crucial information has not been provided adequately by snapshot-based conventional approaches, such as sighting surveys. Spatiotemporal habitat utilization patterns of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) were investigated using fin-mounted Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS) tags. Behavioral states at each tracking location were categorized into transiting- or area-restricted searching (ARS) modes based on Bayesian state-space model. Twelve satellite-tracked dolphins showed different movement patterns. Their habitat ranges were estimated by minimum convex polygons (MCPs), and movement patterns were classified into three types (four animals each of eastward, offshore, and westward movements) based on MCP overlapping among tagged dolphins. The animals that restricted their habitat to the coastward side of the KC (CSKC) tended to show ARS modes more frequently. Estimated locations of these animals corresponded well with cold coastal waters. On the other hand, offshore movements corresponded well with clockwise flow generated by the bifurcation of the KC, and those dolphins were likely straying into less productive waters. These patterns suggest that common bottlenose dolphins off the southern coast of Japan mainly utilize productive CSKC waters but occasionally move to offshore waters. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Interactions between cetaceans and the purse seine fishery in coastal waters of mainland Portugal were investigated using onboard observations over a period of 15 years (2003–2018). In 10% of the fishing sets, there were interactions with one of three species of cetaceans: common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), and harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). The common dolphin was the most frequently observed species, occurring in 89% of all interaction events, and the only species with observed mortality. Therefore, this study focused only on the interactions with common dolphins. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to observer data to investigate how the fishing activity and the abundance of small pelagic fish influenced the probability of occurrence of interactions between the common dolphin and the purse seine fishery between 2003 and 2018. The results revealed significant annual and geographic variation in the occurrence of interactions, and a significant influence of fishing effort and catch per unit effort of sardine (Sardina pilchardus). A second GAM in a hurdle model was used to model the number of common dolphins that interacted with the fishing activity as a function of fishing seasonality and the local abundance of pelagic fish. There was a significant effect of the seasonality of the fishing activity and catch per unit effort of sardine and chub mackerel (Scomber colias) on the number of common dolphins interacting with the fishery. The results of this study suggest that the probability of interactions and the number of common dolphins interacting with the fishery were affected by the local abundance of sardine and chub mackerel. As the common dolphin population appears to be increasing in the study area, the risk of by-catch also increases, thus the monitoring of the Portuguese purse seine fishery is important to inform the implementation of management plans, and also as a response to global efforts for sustainable fisheries and marine mammal conservation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Local adaptation and adaptive radiations are typically associated with phenotypic variation suited to alternative environments. In the marine environment, the nature of relevant ecological or environmental transitions is poorly understood, especially for highly mobile species. Here we compare three genetic lineages in the genus Tursiops (bottlenose dolphins), using linear measurements and geometric morphometric techniques, in the context of environmental variation in the northwest Indian Ocean. Cranial morphology was clearly differentiated comparing Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus, while a recently discovered genetic lineage, found in the Arabian Sea, was morphologically most similar to T. aduncus from the same region, but distinct for various measures, particularly metrics associated with the lateral dimension of the skull. The extent of divergence between T. truncatus and T. aduncus compared to differences between the T. aduncus lineages is consistent with the recent phylogeny for these species. Therefore, with the corroboration of genetic and morphological inference, we propose two conservation units of T. aduncus be recognized in the region at a sub-specific level so that their conservation can be managed effectively. We consider possible evolutionary mechanisms associated with regional habitat characteristics and the exploitation of distinct prey resources. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Dolphin teeth contain enamel, dentin, and cementum. In dentin, growth layer groups (GLGs), deposited at incremental rates (e.g., annually), are used for aging. Major, minor, and trace elements are incorporated within teeth; their distribution within teeth varies, reflecting tooth function and temporal changes in an individual’s exposure. This study used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the distribution of major (e.g., Ca, P), minor (e.g., Cl, Mg, Na), and trace elements (e.g., Cd, Hg, Pb, Zn) in teeth from 12 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The objective was to compare elemental distributions between enamel and dentin and across GLGs. Across all dolphins and point analyses, the following elements were detected in descending weight percentage (wt %; mean ± SE): O (40.8 ± 0.236), Ca (24.3 ± 0.182), C (14.3 ± 0.409), P (14.0 ± 0.095), Al (4.28 ± 0.295), Mg (1.89 ± 0.047), Na (0.666 ± 0.008), Cl (0.083 ± 0.003). Chlorine and Mg differed between enamel and dentin; Mg increased from the enamel towards the dentin while Cl decreased. The wt % of elements did not vary significantly across the approximate location of the GLGs. Except for Al, which may be due to backscatter from the SEM stub, we did not detect trace elements. Other trace elements, if present, are below the detection limit. Technologies with lower detection limits (e.g., laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)) would be required to confirm the presence and distribution of trace elements in bottlenose dolphin teeth. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The detection and use of emitters’ signals by unintended receivers, i.e., eavesdropping, represents an important and often low-cost way for animals to gather information from their environment. Acoustic eavesdropping can be a key driver in mediating intra- and interspecific interactions (e.g., cooperation, predator–prey systems), specifically in species such as cetaceans that use sound as a primary sensory modality. While most cetacean species produce context-specific sounds, little is known about the use of those sounds by potential conspecific eavesdroppers. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that a social cetacean, Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), is able to gather biologically relevant information by eavesdropping on conspecific sounds. We conducted playback experiments on free-ranging dolphins using three context-specific sounds stimuli and monitored their horizontal movement using visual or airborne focal follow observations. We broadcasted natural sequences of conspecific foraging sounds potentially providing an attractive dinner bell signal (n = 7), male social sounds simulating a risk of forthcoming agonistic interaction (n = 7) and female-calf social sounds representing no particularly threatening context (n = 7). We developed a quantitative movement response score and tested whether animals changed their direction of horizontal movement towards or away from the playback source. Dolphins approached the foraging and the social female-calf sounds whereas they avoided the social male sounds. Hence, by acoustically eavesdropping on conspecifics, dolphins can discriminate between social and behavioural contexts and anticipate potential threatening or beneficial situations. Eavesdropping and the ensuing classification of ‘friend or foe’ can thus shape intra-specific social interactions in cetaceans. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) was identified as the etiologic agent of several epizootic episodes worldwide. Most of these studies are based on unusual mortality events or identification of new viral strains. We investigated the occurrence of CeMV under non-epizootic circumstances at a world heritage in Southern Brazil by a combination of pathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular assays. From 325 stranded cetaceans, 40 were included. Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) was the most frequent species. Interstitial pneumonia and non-suppurative encephalitis were the main pathologic findings associated with CeMV infection. Intracytoplasmic immunolabelling anti-CeMV was observed mainly in lungs and lymph nodes. All samples were negative in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Diagnosis of CeMV is challenging in areas where epizootic episodes have not been recorded and due to post-mortem changes. We observed a CeMV prevalence of 27.5%. The results described here increase the knowledge about CeMV under non-epizootic conditions in Brazil and worldwide. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

ABSTRACT: The first-ever case of animal tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is described in a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) found stranded on the coasts of Sicily, Southern Italy, in 2012. The carcass showed a typical TB granulomatous lesion in the intestine; microbiological culture on solid medium (Stonebrink) allowed to isolate colonies with the characteristic aspect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTC) members. M. bovis was identified by molecular and microbiological tests. Genotyping of the dolphin strain by spoligotyping and Multilocus Variable Number of Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) showed that it was similar to isolates found in cattle herds in Sicily over the period 2008–2012, suggesting an epidemiological correlation with the dolphin case. In particular, we can hypothesise possible contamination by cattle faeces of marine environments due to seasonal rain streams and to the practice to graze animals (cattle, sheep and goats) in seaside areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Hyper-longirostry, the character of having extremely elongated rostra, emerged in the early and middle Miocene among several different clades of echolocating toothed whales (odontocetes) followed by a rapid decline near the end of the middle Miocene, and postdated by a much lower number of occurrences in the late Miocene and Pliocene and a complete absence among extant odontocetes. New finds of unreworked fossils of Xiphiacetus cristatus (Eurhinodelphinidae) in the middle Tortonian Diest Formation in Belgium (9.54–8.8 Ma) allow for the documentation of the survival of a hyper-longirostrine dolphin into the early late Miocene. An extensive dataset of the rostral index (calculated as the ratio between rostral length and condylobasal length) of Neogene and extant odontocetes is compiled and presented here, which facilitates discussion of evolutionary trends of rostrum proportions during a time period spanning 23 million years. Of interest, the iterative survival into the late Miocene of a single different species of hyper-longirostrine dolphins in a number of paleogeographic regions (North Sea Basin, Atlantic Coastal Plain, and probably the southeastern Pacific) is noted, whereas hyper-longirostrine morphologies only seem to re-appear by the late Messinian in the Northeastern Pacific. A correlation between this pattern and a decrease in habitat size for coastal to estuarine dolphins linked to a major sea level drop is tentatively proposed; such a process may also have played a role in the ecological shift in several dolphin families to freshwater habitats. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The aquatic ecosystems are an integral part of the global environment and play a critical role in hydrogeological processes in the rivers. In recent decades, the external stressors on the aquatic species have significantly increased due to hydrologic alterations, human activities, and anthropogenic changes to their natural habitat. Global climate change has led to rivers' hydrological flow regime shifts, leading to unsuitable habitat conditions. It is, therefore, crucial to assess the potential implications of climate change on habitat suitability to ensure the long-term sustainability of freshwater species. In this direction, we investigated the association between endangered Gangetic dolphin populations and climate-driven hydrologic flow regime alterations in the Kulsi river, India. We developed a coupled eco-hydraulic framework comprising hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling to study the impact of past and projected climate change scenarios on the habitat suitability of target species. The framework was tested on a 15-km stretch of the Kulsi River, where the dolphin population has significantly declined in recent years. The temporal changes in the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) were analyzed using flow parameters and habitat suitability curves. Our findings suggest that the dolphin population decline coincided with a decrease in WUA, indicating a strong association between flow regimes and habitat suitability. Under climate change scenarios, multi-model climate projections and hydrological-hydrodynamic simulations show a rising trend in precipitation and streamflow in the basin, with substantial uncertainty. Higher flow depth and velocity would enhance WUA (habitat suitability). Still, the proposed river development projects in upstream regions could pose a serious threat to fragile dolphin communities by changing the seasonal flow patterns. The findings of this study can be included in conservation action plans and flow regulations strategies in upstream projects to ensure the long-term survival of endangered species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Recent offshore windfarm development has led to increased vessel traffic in the Eastern Taiwan Strait, which is part of the habitat of the critically endangered Taiwanese humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis taiwanensis). However, data on possible effects on the behavior of this endemic subspecies are lacking to date. In this study, we observed Taiwanese humpback dolphins’ acoustic behavior associated with shipping noise and analyzed their whistles and clicks before, during, and after vessel transit. Before vessel transit, the median rate of dolphin whistles and clicks was 100 and 1550 counts per minute, which significantly reduced to less than 8 and 170 counts per minute during and after vessel transit. Dolphins produced significantly shorter whistles during (0.07 s) and after (0.15 s) vessel transit. The vocalizing behavior of the Taiwanese humpback dolphin may be affected by vessel transit, which, if sustained, could possibly influence the individual communication and feeding success of the population. Implementing measures such as re-routing of the vessel lanes and regulating the speed of the vessel traffic in the habitat are proposed to overcome the influence of vessel noise on Taiwanese humpback dolphins. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Heterogeneous seascapes and strong environmental gradients in coastal waters are expected to influence adaptive divergence, particularly in species with large population sizes where selection is expected to be highly efficient. However, these influences might also extend to species characterized by strong social structure, natal philopatry and small home ranges. We implemented a seascape genomic study to test this hypothesis in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) distributed along the environmentally heterogeneous coast of southern Australia. The data sets included oceanographic and environmental variables thought to be good predictors of local adaptation in dolphins and 8081 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped for individuals sampled from seven different bioregions. From a neutral perspective, population structure and connectivity of the dolphins were generally influenced by habitat type and social structuring. Genotype-environment association analysis identified 241 candidate adaptive loci and revealed that sea surface temperature and salinity gradients influenced adaptive divergence in these animals at both large- (1000 km) and fine-scales (<100 km). Enrichment analysis and annotation of candidate genes revealed functions related to sodium-activated ion transport, kidney development, adipogenesis and thermogenesis. The findings of spatial adaptive divergence and inferences of putative physiological adaptations challenge previous suggestions that marine megafauna is most likely to be affected by environmental and climatic changes via indirect, trophic effects. Our work contributes to conservation management of coastal bottlenose dolphins subjected to anthropogenic disturbance and to efforts of clarifying how seascape heterogeneity influences adaptive diversity and evolution in small cetaceans. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In coastal populations of the common bottlenose dolphin, resident females are usually more abundant and have more restricted home ranges than males. Here, we studied sex-specific population dynamics of bottlenose dolphins off the Alvarado Lagoon System, southwestern Gulf of Mexico. We used standard photo-identification and capture-mark-recapture methods to determine population parameters under the superpopulation approach. Seasonal survival fluctuated around 0.96 (range: 0.80–1.00) and was equal for the sexes; recruitment of putative females (PF) and males (PM) was low, asynchronous, and reached 0.14 (range: 0.04–0.10) and 0.09 (range: 0.09–0.09), respectively, indicating high residency. PF abundance ranged from 60, 95% CI [48, 74] in the northern winds' season of 2008 to a low of 38, 95% CI [31, 47] in the dry season of 2010. PM abundance ranged from a high of 14, 95% CI [12, 16] in the northern winds' season of 2008 to a low of 9, 95% CI [7, 11] in the dry season of 2010. A regression analysis showed significant autocorrelation, and a pattern in the residuals of abundance, indicating no trends as well as temporal fluctuations that suggest a possible carrying capacity effect. Accordingly, high site fidelity, restricted ranging patterns, and low sporadic recruitment from the superpopulation are likely driving population parameters for this population. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we isolated eight strains of Candida albicans from the blowhole air cultures of eight dolphins (one Pacific white-sided dolphin and seven bottlenose dolphins) housed at the Enoshima Aquarium. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of antifungals for these isolates were determined by conducting E-test and broth microdilution assays using the CLSI M27-A3 protocol antifungal susceptibility testing method. Only one of the eight dolphins from which Candida had been isolated had been treated with amphotericin B (AMB), and four had been treated with itraconazole (ITZ). All isolates were identified as Candida albicans, and all were resistant to both ITZ and voriconazole, though the isolates exhibited susceptibility to AMB and micafungin. Based on our findings, we suspect that the frequency of occurrence of azole-resistant Candida species is increasing in captive dolphins as well as in their aquarium environments. © 2022 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Detecting dolphins, accurately identifying species, and estimating group size during manned aerial surveys can be challenging. We used images obtained during a manned aerial survey over 13 non-consecutive days and covering a total of 3732 km of transects, in a high-wing aircraft flown at 185 km/h and an altitude of 152 m, equipped with three Single Lens Reflex cameras, to supplement estimates of dolphins recorded by observers. We used this opportunity to assess the adequacy of the resulting images for species identification of two morphologically similar dolphin species (i.e., with similar coloration and body size): the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis) and to accurately estimate dolphin group size. We also compared dolphin group estimates and species identification made by observers during the aerial survey, with manual review of the aerial images, where images overlapped with the observers’ field of view from the aircraft. We collected and reviewed 413000 images and found that an image resolution of 1.25 cm per pixel was adequate to distinguish between the two targeted dolphin species. Our findings suggest that aerial images can improve species identification and estimates of group size > 5. The camera setup and photography parameters that we describe here, with the survey altitude and speed that were used, has the potential to be used to identify, and accurately estimate other morphologically similar small-bodied (< 3 m) species in the marine environment. This will be an important consideration for future aerial surveys of low density, threatened species, that form small and sometimes mixed species groups, including humpback and bottlenose dolphins where their distribution overlaps. © 2022, Crown.

ABSTRACT: A 35-year-old female Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) presented with lethargy, dysorexia, obesity and locomotor difficulties. An abnormal deposition of fat and superficial skin lesions was observed. Laboratory findings showed lymphopenia and eosinopenia associated with hypercholesterolemia. Endocrinological assessment revealed chronically increased serum cortisol values associated with increased plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentration. ACTH-dependent hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's syndrome, was strongly suspected. The bottlenose dolphin was treated with ketoconazole (2.3 mg/kg every 12 hours) and prednisone (0.03 mg/kg every 48 hours), which resulted in an improvement in clinical signs, except for obesity. Long-term treatment with ketoconazole and prednisolone did not cause any adverse effects. However, the authors recommend avoiding concurrent hormonal treatment with altrenogest as it might cause a relapse of hyperadrenocorticism or drug–drug interaction with ketoconazole. Endocrinopathies are rare in cetaceans but this case highlights the importance of considering hyperadrenocorticism as a differential diagnosis in dolphins with obesity and skin lesions. © 2022 British Veterinary Association

ABSTRACT: Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) inhabit shallow waters of the tropical western Atlantic, an area that is now mostly occupied by cities and harbours. Demographic studies have been concentrated in sheltered areas of south/south-eastern Brazil. This study investigated site fidelity and estimated population abundance and apparent survival of Guiana dolphins in Mucuripe Embayment (ME), on the north-eastern Brazilian coast, through photo-identification surveys and closed and open population mark–recapture models, from October 2009 to September 2011. Forty-six Guiana dolphin groups were recorded (in groups of between one and eight dolphins, with a mean ± SD of 3.49 ± 2.33) in 27 out of 40 surveys. Twenty-five animals were photo-identified, with eight considered to have a ‘poor health’ status. The standardized site fidelity index (SSFI) was low (0.25). Using the program capture, the time and heterogeneity model (Mth) resulted in a total abundance estimate of 39, with a Coefficient of Variation (CV) of 21% (95% CI 35–80%). In program mark, model averaging resulted in a total abundance estimate of 33 (CV 32%, 95% CI 30–100%). Using a CV of 21%, the power to detect a decline of 50% during the study period was 0.44 and the power to detect a decline of 5% a year was 0.11. To detect these declines with a 0.90 power, 12 years of monitoring would be necessary. The annual adult apparent survival rate was low (0.71; CV 19%; 95% CI 0.40–0.90), and differed for dolphins in ‘good’ (0.64; CV 28%, 95% CI 0.27–0.89) and ‘poor’ (0.85; CV 22%; 95% CI: 0.23–0.99) health. The low abundance of Guiana dolphins in ME indicates that conservation actions should start immediately, such as creating a marine protected area, continuing awareness campaigns, using by-catch reduction technologies, developing new regulations, and promoting law enforcement. Monitoring studies must continue with increased effort to reduce uncertainty in estimates and to improve the power to detect trends of decline. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The habitat use by two neighboring coastal bottlenose dolphin communities (Posorja and El Morro) was evaluated in the western inner estuary of the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador (3°S, 80°55′W). The study aimed to determine to what extent some environmental variables influence dolphins' distribution and behavior. The analysis included 344 dolphin groups recorded between 2014 and 2019. For both dolphin communities, 95% of home ranges were estimated (23.5 km2 Posorja and 44.8 km2, El Morro). Home ranges overlapped in an area of 11.2 km2. No clear preference for areas to carry out specific activities was found, as dolphins used the same areas for multiple purposes. Multinomial logistic regression with four environmental parameters (distance to shore, depth, hour of day and tide) were used as predictor variables of behavior. A significant relationship between the tidal cycle and behavioral states was found with feeding occurring more frequently during the low tide, socializing and transit during high tide, and resting during mid-tide. Count models were used with environmental and behavioral variables to explore their relationship with dolphins' group size. Differences with respect to dolphin counts were associated with tide height and socialization. Depth is relevant for predicting dolphin counts mainly during high tide. We recommend that environmental authorities consider the dolphins' preference to carry out their activities within small home ranges, identify overlapping human activities and take steps to reduce potential conflicts, such as prohibiting all types of gillnets in areas of high concentration of dolphins. Likewise, regular assessments are required to detect future changes in both dolphins' habitat and human uses over time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Evaluation of metabolic characteristics encompassing short-term performance-based physical activities has fundamental and practical implications to enhance management practices associated with dolphin–human swim interactions. A total of four male and six female bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were involved in the study. All 10 animals were first assigned to a no-swim interaction group as a control group and, after a period of 5 to 77 days of routine training and performance activities, animals were assigned to a dolphin–human swim interaction group. For the swim interaction group, the first or early morning session (0842 to 1005 h) and second or late afternoon session (1354 to 1454 h) involved various degrees of physical activities with and without human participants. For the no-swim interaction group, dolphins swam freely in separate pens prior to feeding and collection of blood samples at corresponding times in the morning and afternoon. Blood samples were collected from both groups within 15 minutes before and after the morning and afternoon sessions. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, lactate, and ammonia were determined using enzyme immunoassay and clinical chemistry techniques. Mean cortisol concentrations were lower after the early morning session (p< 0.021) by 56% and after the late afternoon session (p< 0.004) by 43%. Conversely, and although not statistically significant, mean lactate concentrations were higher after the morning session by 18% and after the afternoon session by 19%. There was also a decrease in ammonia concentrations in the no-swim interaction group during the afternoon session. Regardless of groups and times, there was a temporal negative correlation (r = -0.359, p< 0.0015) between cortisol and lactate such that cortisol decreased (p< 0.05) by 59% from the morning to afternoon and, conversely, lactate increased (p< 0.05) by 68% from the morning to afternoon. While relevance of the inverse relationship between cortisol and lactate requires clarification, the results continue to support the concept that short-term, performance-based physical activities are not metabolically challenging in bottlenose dolphins that are trained and conditioned for dolphin–human swim interactions. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Balancing the sustainable practices of whale watching and cetacean species conservation is an enormous challenge for the countries that rely on whale watching tourism industry. In this study, we employ the choice experiment method to estimate the tourists' heterogeneity preferences (THP) on different attributes to establish an impact mitigation program in Taiwan. We found that the scenario of integrated cetacean conservation and sustainable whale-dolphin watching has the highest welfare effects among all the proposed scenarios. Features that affect the differentiation of THP are: (1) tourists' awareness, and conservation attitudes, (2) nationality, and (3) monthly income. The findings from this research could assist the government and tour operators to tailor their policy and management strategy that respond to the present issues by focusing on time schedule management, vessel slowdown distance, set up maximum boat numbers, build-up operational guidance, and by establishing a conservation fund.

ABSTRACT: In an odontocete rehabilitation center in the Netherlands, repeated observations were made over several days of interspecific cooperative behavior initiated by three white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris)—that is, mutually beneficial cooperation with humans and altruism toward three harbor porpoises (Phocoena pho-coena). In the first observation (mutually beneficial cooperation), a white-beaked dolphin cooperated on her own initiative with humans to herd a harbor porpoise toward a veterinary treatment/ feeding area in the pool. In the second observation (altruism), two recently recovered white-beaked dolphins assisted newly arrived harbor porpoises with swimming. These first recorded examples of interspecific mutually beneficial cooperation and altruism initiated by white-beaked dolphins will help to elucidate the motivation behind such behavior and the potential fitness benefits resulting from it. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Abundance estimates of cetaceans in the western Indian Ocean are rare, but important, as many cetacean populations are under threat, especially those in coastal habitats. This study aimed to generate first estimates of abundance for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), assessed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, in an area identified by the Marine Mammal Protected Area Task Force as an ‘Important Marine Mammal Area’. Two study sites were surveyed along the east and west coastlines of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania. Between 2014 and 2016, four boat-based visual surveys conducted a total of 2467 km of survey effort sighting a total of 16 groups of T. aduncus in west Pemba. Abundance was estimated using mark-recapture models of photo-identified individuals as 89 individuals (CV 7.7 %, 95 % CI 76-103) in the 1084 km2 study area. In the Tanga study area in 2016 two boat-based visual surveys covered 1254 km of effort during which 15 groups of T. aduncus were sighted, resulting in a photo-ID based mark-recapture abundance estimate of 177 individuals (CV 8.6 %, 95 % CI 150-210) in the 1562 km2 study site. Group encounter rate for this species in Tanga was at least double that recorded in the Pemba study site. A total of 23 % of identified dolphins bore the scars of interactions with fishing gear. © 2022, Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasingly recorded over the last decades and much work has linked these events to multiple oceanographic and climate disturbances. HABs can affect ecosystems either as events that affect dissolved oxygen, clog fish gills, or smother corals or through the production of biotoxins which affect living marine resources through food web transfers or aerosols. HAB represent a natural driver of decline and potential extinction of aquatic organisms, from invertebrates to mammals, which may offer little evolutionary adaptation particularly in very high and long-lasting exposures. Despite numerous multispecies mass-mortality events linked to HAB-associated biotoxicosis globally, there are no records in cetaceans off the central eastern Atlantic Ocean. Herein, we report the epidemiology, pathologic, microbiologic and toxicologic investigation results attesting to the first documentation of cetacean mass-mortality in European waters associated with brevetoxins. Twelve rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) were found dead adrift or beached along the southwestern coast of Gran Canaria from April 28th to May 7th, 2008. Although pathologic examinations were limited by moderate to advanced autolysis and decomposition of the carcasses, consistent findings included multisystemic hemorrhage and undigested ingesta within the gastric compartments, mainly salema porgy (Sarpa salpa). Toxicologic analysis of gastric contents identified PbTx2 and PbTx3 brevetoxins. Our results provide compelling toxicopathologic evidence of fatal brevetoxicosis in a cohort of rough-toothed dolphins. These data add to the limited knowledge on pathology of HAB in cetaceans and provide the first account of brevetoxicosis in European waters. No other mass-mortality or individual fatality of any cetacean species has been linked to brevetoxicosis in the Canary Islands since this event.

ABSTRACT: Detailed examinations of dolphins incidentally caught in bather protection nets along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, South Africa, over the past 10 years have yielded a dataset that can assist in the examination of external signs of bycatch. Investigating these external signs of fisheries interactions could aid in determining whether they could be used as unequivocal indicators of entanglement in stranded dolphins for which cause of death is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of netmarks and other external injuries on individuals of two dolphin species (Tursiops aduncus and Sousa plumbea), both bycaught and stranded, along the south‐east coast of South Africa. Necropsy reports and photographs of 107 bycaught and 15 stranded dolphins between 2010 and 2017 were investigated to determine prevalence of netmarks and other external injuries in relation to species, sex, age class, and water temperature. Our results indicated that 36% of the bycaught dolphins and 13% of stranded dolphins showed netmarks on the skin. In bycaught animals, females were more likely to show netmarks (58%) and the majority of dolphins with netmarks were immatures (66%; immatures included calves, neonates and subadults). There was little evidence for water temperature affecting the appearance of netmarks. Furthermore, species, sex or age class did not play a significant role in the probability of netmark occurrence. Other external injuries were also observed in the bycaught (3–50%) and stranded animals (7–100%), with subcutaneous bruising being the most prominent sign in bycaught animals. Our study showed that only a small percentage of known bycaught animals actually present external signs of entanglement. Thus, additional evidence, such as histopathological examinations, is required to reliably identify entanglement cases in stranded animals. © 2022 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Relatively scant information is available on the Risso’s dolphin in comparison to the other species regularly present in the Mediterranean Sea. Recently, its conservation status has been updated to Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in this Sea. Therefore, the need to increase information on its biology and ecology is even more urgent. This study reports the first preliminary information on the behavioral traits of the species occurring in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea). Data on predominant behavioral activity states and on a set of group composition variables (group formation, cruising speed, dive duration and interaction between individuals) were collected from April 2019 to September 2021, applying the focal-group protocol with instantaneous scan sampling. Group size, depth and group composition variables were compared between activity states. Results highlight that both the group size and the several variables considered varied significantly depending on activity state. The group size was significantly smaller during feeding than resting and traveling and a characterization in terms of group formation, cruise speed, dive duration and interaction between animals is provided for the different activity states. Moreover, a list of behavioral events which occurred, as well as their relative frequency of distribution among activity states, is reported. Finally, details on the sympatric occurrences between Risso’s and striped dolphins, as well as the repetitive interaction observed between adult individuals and plastic bags floating on the sea surface, are reported and discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustics is widely used to monitor dolphin presence in marine environment. The current study proposes a self-made/low-cost approach to assemble a complete and compact underwater acoustic recorder employing inexpensive and widely used components. The system is composed of two main elements: the computing unit (Raspberry Pi Zero 2W single board computer) and the sound acquiring sensor, i.e., a hydrophone based on a single-face piezo capsule disk (hydrophone cost ≈10.00). The performance of the proposed hydrophone was preliminarily tested versus the commercial-available AS-1 hydrophone (commercial value = 395.00), during 30-minute acquisition sessions performed in a dolphin pool. The comparison was performed quantifying the capability of the two systems to provide a high-quality signal to assess echolocation clicks (EC), whistles (W), and burst pulse sounds (P) emitted by dolphins. Results showed that the worsening of performances introduced by the current low-cost approach is very limited since: 1) the average number of ECs detected over sixty selected 5-second portions of the acquired signal is not significantly different (146.6±66.7 for home-made vs. 151.1±73 for AS-1, p >0.05); 2) the total number of detected ECs is comparable (8797 vs. 9065, ≈3% difference); 3) the number of detected whistles is the same for the two devices (11); and 4) the error made by the low-cost approach in the detection of burst pulse sounds is lower than 7%. Looking to the future, this effective and low-cost technology will make possible to monitor dolphin presence over larger areas using a network of low-cost acoustic recorders.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The presence and distribution of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were evaluated in spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) from the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (Western Atlantic Ocean). Blubber samples (n = 37) were Soxhlet extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The levels of POPs reported in this study are far below those previously reported in spinner dolphins from the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Despite relatively low levels of contaminants, the presence of chemicals represents an additional stressor to these marine mammals, which are subject to increasing anthropogenic pressures, especially regarding tourism activities, in Fernando de Noronha. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Populations of the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) inhabit coastal and riverine waters in Southeast Asia, which have seen increased anthropogenic disturbances with economic development of the region. The dolphins have historically been hunted and traded for entertainment, but the dolphins serve as a fiscal asset to local fishing markets and ecotourism activities. Today, the largest threats to these small populations include nonselective fishing techniques, including gillnet and electrofishing; habitat degradation and fragmentation from construction projects, natural resource extraction, and land-use intensification; and habitual disturbance and physical harm boat traffic, including transportation and ecotourism. Local and international actors, including government and nongovernmental decision-makers, have conducted mark-recapture and mark-resight surveys to improve understanding of population dynamics. In response to these population surveys, the actors have enacted trade and fishing regulations to protect this culturally significant species, and for some populations, regional governments enforce acceptable fishing and boating practices with river patrol in designated conservation territories. The dolphin holds religious and patriotic esteem within the region, which makes localized education and community-centered activism effective conservation strategies. The dolphin’s ecological significance as a keystone species necessitates the implementation of protected areas to ensure the recovery of individual populations and riverine health. Continued data collection through population surveys and appeal to local communities will be crucial to pursuing successful conservation of this slowly recovering species. Past conservation efforts have been effective overall, and augmenting community engagement will benefit dolphin population recovery. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

ABSTRACT: Due to the diversity of the phenomenon, dolphin cooperation has attracted considerable research interest in both wild populations and those under human care. Dolphins cooperate in various contexts, including group hunting, alloparental care, social learning, social play and alliance formation for securing mates. This investigation focused on the effect of group size and partner choice in a cooperative task using systematic group testing. A cooperative enrichment device was made of a PVC tube containing fish and ice that was temporarily sealed with two PVC caps with rope handles attached. The device was designed to be operated by pairs of dolphins, opened by simultaneous pull of its two handles. The analysis focused on two behaviours, cooperative opening and cooperative play with the device. Testing focused on an adult male dolphin group including four to six individuals and using a single or two devices. Altogether five group testing arrangements and a pairwise testing phase were conducted. Out of the six dolphins, five showed active involvement. All ten possible pairs of the five active dolphins were successful in opening and playing with the device cooperatively. Cooperation increased with group size, but the social networks showed no significant differences among group arrangements. However, the cooperative pairs showed a significant difference in success rate during pairwise vs group testing, while demonstrating a strong partner preference. This study provides the first evidence for partner choice with regards to cooperation in male dolphins. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The novel autonomous rolling performance is realized by the pair of pectoral fins of a three-dimensional(3-D) bionic dolphin in this paper numerically. 3-D Navier–Stokes equations are employed to simulate the viscous fluid around the bionic dolphin. The effect of self-rolling manoeuvrability is explored using the dynamic mesh technology and user-defined function (UDF). By varying the parameter ratios, the interaction of flexible pectoral fins is divided into two motion modes, amplitude differential and frequency differential mode. As the primary driving source, the differential motion of a pair of pectoral fins can effectively provide the rolling torque, and the trajectory of the entire rolling process is approximately the clockwise spiral. The results demonstrate that the rolling angular velocity and driving torque in the steady state can be improved by increasing parameter ratios, and the rolling efficiency can reach the maximum under the optimal parameter ratio. Meanwhile, different parameter ratios do not affect the rolling radius of the self-rolling dolphin. The evolution process around the pair of pectoral fins is shown by the flow structures in self-rolling swimming, reasonably revealing that self-rolling locomotion is produced by the pressure and wake vortices surrounding the pair of pectoral fins, and the wake structures depend primarily on the variation of parameter ratio. It properly turns out that the application of the pair of pectoral fins can realize the self-rolling performance through parameter differential modes. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Numerous species of cetaceans are known to engage in epimeletic (caregiving) behavior towards injured or distressed conspecifics (Harzen & dos Santos, 1992; Howells et al., 2009; Bearzi et al., 2018). This behavior refers to the help given by one or more healthy individuals towards a sick, injured, or dead individual (Caldwell & Caldwell, 1966; Bearzi et al., 2017) and can be directed towards adults, designated as “succorant,” or towards infants, designated as “nurturant” (Caldwell & Caldwell, 1966). Caldwell & Caldwell (1966) divided succorant behavior into three broad categories: (1) standing by (where despite not directly aiding the distressed animal, healthy individuals stay with it, even if it entails remaining in a dangerous area), (2) excitement (where companions of the afflicted individual appear extremely disturbed as well and may attempt to protect it from a perceived source of danger), and (3) supporting (where the struggling mammal is directly assisted by the succorants, who support it at the surface to breathe). Reports of succorant behavior are uncommon, albeit existent for both wild and captive cetaceans (Kuczaj et al., 2015). On the other hand, nurturant behavior, typically provided by adult females, appears to be more commonly observed in cetaceans (Cockcroft & Sauer, 1990). © 2022, Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, is the only extant species of its family and the most threatened small cetacean in the Western South Atlantic. Understanding life traits that shape the population dynamics and variation in the demography of threatened species is critical for their conservation. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the life history of the franciscana, integrating information from 40 years of studies. We also discuss the species´ mating system and make recommendations regarding future research. Franciscana longevity is ca. 20 years, but with very few animals reaching more than 12/14 years. Growth curves are available for franciscanas in all distribution range. Females are larger than males and the mean reversed sexual size dimorphism for all populations is 17%. Sex ratio at birth is 1:1 and the size at birth is around 70 cm, with few exceptions. The franciscana is an annual breeding and monoestrous species. Ovulations and conceptions are concentrated in the austral summer, about two-thirds occurring from December to February. Franciscana presents a typical birth-pulse pattern in most of its range, with births starting in early spring and decreasing gradually until the end of austral summer. Mean gestation length estimate is 10.5 months and lactation lasts 7–9 months. The average age at sexual maturity (ASM) ranges from 2.7 to 3.9 years, depending on the population and estimator. Survival rates for juvenile franciscana were estimated at 0.91 and 0.90, while for adults were estimated at 0.85 and 0.86. Multimetodological approach suggests that adult franciscanas form monogamous reproductive pairs of unknown duration, where a male performs mate guarding. A matrilineal society where offspring remain for some time in the same group of their mother is likely. Collectively, the franciscana can be considered one of the cetaceans with fastest life-history traits, mainly due to its remarkably low ASM, short reproductive interval, low survival rates, and short life span. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Conservation actions often rely on some knowledge of the status of a population and can be more effectively implemented if trends in population size are known. Therefore, estimation of abundance is key to contributing to the conservation of the franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei), the most endangered small cetacean in the western South Atlantic. Anthropogenic threats to this species have been recognized for nearly half a century but consistent efforts to estimate abundance and assess the potential effects of these threats to the franciscana have only been developed in the past 25 years. While estimates of abundance are available for all five recognized Franciscana Management Areas (FMAs), only a few of them cover the whole range of the species within these areas. In addition, no empirical estimates of trends in abundance have been computed. In this chapter, an overview of what is known about estimates of abundance of the franciscana is provided. It includes a historical perspective, improvements in survey methods, a review of existing estimates for all FMAs, and a discussion about future work that could improve our ability to estimate abundance and monitor trends of this threatened species. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Assisted reproduction techniques are required to maintain a genetically diverse captive population of bottlenose dolphins. These techniques include semen preservation, and liquid storage has been proposed as a suitable alternative to cryopreservation, but the optimum conditions, in terms of temperature, duration, and media, have yet to be fully established. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the optimum temperature for the liquid storage of dolphin semen during a 14-day period and the usefulness of carboxylated poly-L-lysine (CPLL) as an additive to the semen extender used for the liquid storage. The semen was collected from a mature male dolphin housed at the Kagoshima Aquarium, Japan, transferred into a Beltsville (BF5F) extender, and analyzed for motility and characteristics after five-fold dilution. The optimum temperature was determined by evaluating sperm viability after liquid storage at 4, 17, or 36 °C, and the usefulness of CPLL was evaluated at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0% (v/v) at the optimum temperature. Sperm stored at 4 ℃ had a greater motility maintenance compared with samples stored at 17 or 36 ℃. The most efficacious storage regimen at various time points occurred when there was addition of CPLL at 1.0% (v/v) in terms of sperm motility and other relevant determinations, with this storage approach having greater efficacy that samples stored without CPLL. The most efficacious processes for preserving bottlenose dolphin sperm functions is storage at 4 °C and with there being semen extender supplementation of 1% CPLL. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), a marine mammal in the family Delphinidae, is classified as a critically endangered species under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The adult female length is approximately 2.1 to 2.2 m, while an adult male can reach up to 2.8 m. They have a round head with a small dorsal fin and a greyish body. Irrawaddy dolphins are estimated to reach sexual maturity at 7 to 9 years of age, and the mating season is observed from December to June in the Northern Hemisphere (Smith, 2009). They feed on fish, shrimp, and small aquatic animals, and they can be found in marine, brackish, and freshwater environments throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including the Irrawaddy River, Maekong River, and Bengal Bay (Smith, 2009). The number of Irrawaddy dolphins is declining in the wild, but some are kept in captivity in Japan, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Thailand (Curry et al., 2013) © 2022, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under professional care are susceptible to developing ammonium urate (NH4U) kidney stones that may lead to azotemia, hematuria, renal obstruction, reduced renal function, and renal failure. Diagnosis of kidney stones in dolphins is best achieved using a combination of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT). CT with intravenous (IV) contrast and renal scintigraphy have been successfully utilized to assess renal perfusion, function, and obstruction in dolphins. Cases with partial ureteral obstruction have recently been treated with medical management. If the problem worsens, surgical intervention may be required. Studies comparing free-ranging and managed dolphin populations have revealed differences in urinary physicochemistry and renal stone prevalence. Further, nutrient analyses of fish species comparing the diets of free-ranging versus managed dolphin populations have revealed differences in key nutrients, including lower acid and purine content, respectively. Modified diet feeding trials, targeting a lower acid and purine content, have demonstrated a dietary impact on improving urinary risk factors, implicating the role of nutrition in the pathophysiology of stone formation. Current best practices for management of kidney stone disease in dolphins consist of a combination of hydration and diet optimization, aimed to reduce the risk factors associated with stone formation. Further dietary and treatment optimization efforts are currently underway. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans depend highly on acoustic signals, such as whistles, for social communication. Mixed-species associations (MSAs), temporary or long-term encounters between different species, may play an important role on the acoustic dynamics of the species involved. Because of whistles’ communication function, we used these sounds to investigate the acoustic relationships of Tursiops truncatus when involved in different group contexts: in MSAs with two other delphinid species and in single species group. Acoustic recordings of T. truncatus single species groups and in associations with Globicephala melas and Grampus griseus were collected in the Western South Atlantic Ocean through a towed array of hydrophones. A total of 1267 whistles were analysed and acoustical parameters were extracted. To verify the differences among whistles produced in such contexts a support vector machine and random forest analysis were implemented. Both analyses revealed a clear separation of whistles from the single species versus the MSA as well as between both MSAs. The results indicate that interspecific associations may influence the whistle structure and suggests that T. truncatus whistles can be modified during interspecific interactions. These findings are useful to elucidate the possible factors underlying behavioural plasticity and interspecific associations and to understand dolphins’ acoustic communication. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The Mediterranean Sea is one of the world’s seas most affected by human activities. In this region, concern for the conservation status of the common dolphin Delphinus delphis has been expressed since the 1990s. Systematic culling campaigns and intentional takes represented a major cause of mortality between the 1870s and the 1970s. These killings slowed down or largely ceased in the 1970s, but other negative human impacts have increased dramatically since then. Ongoing depletion of key prey caused by overfishing, as well as food-web competition with fisheries, have been identified as important threats in recent decades. Factors that likely contributed to making common dolphins increasingly less common also include incidental mortality in fishing gear, habitat degradation, and the effects of chemical pollutants, underwater noise, and climate change. These impacts may have increased demographic fragmentation, resulting in low density or scattered occurrence across most of the basin, small group sizes, and occasional admixture with striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba. Formal commitments to protect Mediterranean common dolphins have been made repeatedly in national and international fora, but conservation action has remained largely on paper. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Bubble netting in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) is probably the best known and most studied cetacean foraging strategy relying on the emission of bubbles to secure prey (Jurasz & Jurasz, 1979; Wiley et al., 2011; Pirotta et al., 2021). However, some delphinid species, such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus; Fertl & Wilson, 1997), Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis; Fertl & Würsig, 1995), killer whales (Orcinus orca; Similä & Ugarte, 1993; Visser et al., 2008), dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus; Trudelle, 2010), and false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens; Zaeschmar et al., 2013), have also been recorded utilising bubbles for com-munication to facilitate prey capture. © 2022,International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

ABSTRACT: Determining how cetaceans and other threatened marine animals use coastal habitats is critical to the effective conservation of these species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging tool that can potentially be used to detect cetaceans over broad spatial and temporal scales. In particular, eDNA may present a useful complementary method for monitoring their presence during visual surveys in nearshore areas, and for co-detecting prey. In conjunction with ongoing visual surveys, we tested the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to detect the presence and identity of cetaceans in the New York Bight (NYB), and to identify fish species (potential prey) present in the area. In almost all cases in which humpback whales and dolphins were visually observed, DNA from these species was also detected in water samples. To assess eDNA degradation over time, we took samples in the same location 15 and 30 min after a sighting in seven instances, and found that eDNA often, but not always, dropped to low levels after 30 min. Atlantic menhaden were detected in all samples and comprised the majority of fish sequences in most samples, in agreement with observations of large aggregations of this important prey species in the NYB. While additional data are needed to better understand how factors such as behavior and oceanographic conditions contribute to the longevity of eDNA signals, these results add to a growing body of work indicating that eDNA is a promising tool to complement visual and acoustic surveys of marine megafauna.

ABSTRACT: In species that copulate during non-conceptive periods, such as humans and bonobos, sexual intercourse is known to be pleasurable for females. Dolphins also copulate throughout the year, largely to establish and maintain social bonds1. In dolphins, the clitoris is positioned in the anterior aspect of the vaginal entrance2, where physical contact and stimulation during copulation is likely. Clitoral stimulation seems to be important during female–female sexual interactions in common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), which rub each other's clitorises using snouts, flippers, or flukes3. Determining a sexual pleasure response in animals not amenable to neurobehavioral examination is difficult, but investigation of the clitoris may elucidate evidence of functionality. In this study, we assessed macro- and micromorphological features of the clitoris in common bottlenose dolphins to examine functional features, including erectile bodies with lacunae, extensible collagen and/or elastin fibers, and the presence and location of sensory nerves. Our observations suggest the clitoris of dolphins has well-developed erectile spaces, is highly sensitive to tactile stimulation, and is likely functional.

ABSTRACT: During our respective careers, we have been fortunate to witness some dramatic observations of animal behavior in the field, but it can be difficult to portray the intensity of these events with the sterile prose we typically employ in scientific manuscripts. In this brief paper, we describe one of the most dramatic behavioral responses we have witnessed in more than 200 playback trials with natural and anthropogenic sounds to dozens of marine mammal species. © 2022, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The iconic Ganges River dolphin Platanista gangetica gangetica is endemic to the Indian subcontinent and has been classified as the most endangered cetacean due to sharp decline in the population size of this obligatory freshwater animal. The species is vulnerable to multiple anthropogenic activities such as habitat fragmentation caused by construction of structural barriers (dams and barrages) and dredging activities, reduced freshwater flow, huge siltation load, depletion of fish stock, use of vulnerable gears, and lack of public awareness. Geographical expansion of artisanal fishing, poaching for collection of their flesh (used as fish bait) and fat and oil (used as an ointment for joint pain and gout), injuries and mortalities due to entanglement with fishing gear are other threats for the species. In addition, they can bioaccumulate several hazardous and toxic chemical pollutants in their body tissues, which are detrimental for their sustenance. Due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019—COVID) pandemic the positive and negative impacts have also been observed and discussed. The following precautionary measures should be undertaken for their conservation: ban fishing in the dolphin hotspot areas and sanctuaries; multispecies management along with law enforcement and sustainable fishing practices; dolphin-fishery interactions should be solved through fishing gear modifications (e.g., mesh size). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals are subject to external injuries from natural and anthropogenic sources. Among the leading causes of severe external injuries are vessel collision and fishing gear entanglement (Byard et al., 2012; Dwyer et al., 2014). Some individuals show remarkable recovery from these severe exter-nal injuries through rapid healing and behavioral adjustment (Elwen & Leeney, 2010; Maze-Foley & Garrison, 2020). External injuries caused by fishing gear (e.g., ghost nets and lines) can be critical as they may cause whole body entanglement or ampu-tation of important body parts such as the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and fluke (Nery et al., 2008). Partial mutilation of body parts or total amputation of the dorsal fin is rarely fatal for wild individuals (Wells et al., 2008). In contrast, complete amputation of the fluke is considered life-threatening and would require intervention for survival. Herein, we report on the survival of a wild, young Indo-Pacific bottle-nose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) with a complete fluke amputation and discuss the implications for long-term injury adjustment as well as conservation concerns. © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Spatio‐temporal variability of marine soundscapes reflects environmental dynamics and local habitat health. This study characterizes the coastal soundscape of the Cres‐Lošinj Natura 2000 Site of Community Importance, encompassing the non‐tourist (11–15 March 2020) and the tourist (26–30 July 2020) season. A total of 240 h of continuous recordings were manually analyzed and the abundance of animal vocalizations and boat noise was obtained; sound pressure levels were calculated for the low (63–2000 Hz) and high (2000–20,000 Hz) frequency range. Two fish sound types were drivers of both seasonal and diel variability of the low‐frequency soundscape. The first is emitted by the cryptic Roche’s snake blenny (Ophidion rochei), while the second, whose emitter remains unknown, was previously only described in canyons and coralligenous habitats of the Western Mediterranean Sea. The high‐frequency bands were characterized by bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) vocalizations, indicating dolphins’ use of area for various purposes. Boat noise, however, dominated the local soundscape along the whole considered periods and higher sound pressure levels were found during the Tourist season. Human‐generated noise pollution, which has been previously found 10 years ago, is still present in the area and this urges management actions. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Risso’s dolphin Grampus griseus was stranded on the coast of Arsuz-Uluçınar, Iskenderun Bay, Turkey in the northeastern Mediterranean on 29 March 2022. This study was conducted to reveal the relationship between G. griseus and microplastic debris in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of one stranding G. griseus was examined, and 454 microplastics particles were extracted. Of all, the majority of them were fibers (96%), black in colour (62%), and 0.5-1 mm in size (38%). This paper represents the first data indicating the microplastic abundance in G. griseus from the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. Also, it creates a baseline to understand the relationship between cetaceans and microplastics in this region. © 2022 B-ENT. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is responsible for epidemic and endemic fatalities in free-ranging cetaceans. Neuro-inflammation sustained by CeMV is a leading cause of death in stranded cetaceans. A novel dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) strain of Atlantic origin circulating in Italian waters since early 2016 has caused acute/subacute lesions associated with positive immunolabelling of the virus. To date, myelin damage has not been fully documented and investigated in cetaceans. This study describes neuropathological findings in the brain tissue of 31 cetaceans found stranded along the Italian coastline and positive for DMV infection on molecular testing. Cell changes in the areas of myelinopathy were revealed by double indirect immunofluorescence. The most frequent DMV-associated lesions were astro-microgliosis, neuronal necrosis, spongiosis, malacia, and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. Myelin reduction and areas of demyelination were revealed by means of a specific myelin biomarker. Morbilliviral antigen immunolabelling was mainly observed in neurons and microglial cells, in association with a marked activation of microglia and astrocytes. These findings extend our knowledge of DMV-associated brain lesions and shed light on their pathogenesis. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Accurate diet estimation of marine mammals is fundamental to investigate their ecological roles in marine habitats, but it remains a pervasive challenge to researchers due to the constraints associated with conventional methods based on stomach contents or feces analysis, which are imprecise, limited to last meal and often biased. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA), an emerging method for diet estimations, has been demonstrated to be reliable in reconstructing long-term diets of many marine mammal predators; however, its application has not been seriously evaluated in dolphins. To this end, we compared the QFASA estimates obtained using 8 pre-existing calibration coefficient sets, 3 fatty acid subsets, and 3 prey library subsets to the true diet of a captive Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) that was fed a long-term diet of mostly gizzard shad (Clupanodon thrissa) with smaller proportions of Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), roughscale tonguesole (Cynoglossus lida), and Chinese herring (Ilisha elongate). The diet of the dolphin was best reconstructed using the calibration coefficients derived from captive feeding trials of American mink (Mustela vison) that were fed herring with the “main” fatty acid subset; this process correctly identified gizzard shad as the main prey source of the dolphin with the highest actual diet proportions and lowest predator signature proportions outside the range of the mean prey proportions. In addition, high accuracy and consistency were acquired in the diet estimations obtained using the calibration coefficients derived from minks fed herring and herring plus seal oil even though pseudo-prey were included in our model, revealing the high robustness and reliability of QFASA in reconstructing the dolphin diet. We recommend caution in selecting fatty acid subsets when using fatty acid signatures derived from different studies. Overall, QFASA offers a promising tool to quantify the long-term diets of humpback dolphins and other odontocetes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The increase and diversification of vessel traffic worldwide has resulted in a variety of known disturbances to dolphins. As a remote island chain, the Hawaiian Islands rely heavily on the marine environment for transportation, recreation, and fishing that aggregates into significant levels of vessel traffic. Given the known presence of dolphins in this region, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the relative exposure risk that vessel traffic poses to island-associated dolphin populations in Hawai‘i. This research identified the spatial distribution of pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops trun-catus) and determined the extent of their overlap with various categories of vessel traffic in Maui Nui, Hawai‘i. Species distribution was determined using kernel density estimates based on sighting data from 50 spotted dolphin sightings and 75 bottlenose dolphin sightings collected from 2013 to 2018. A combination of vessel GPS and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) vessel tracks were used to quantify vessel traffic within the study area, resulting in 22,464 vessel tracks that were subsequently compiled into categories for analysis from 2014 to 2017. Risk of vessel exposure between vessels and dolphins, or co-occurrence, was determined by calculating the product of predicted dolphin density and predicted vessel density. Both species were exposed to vessel traffic risk over 100% of their distribution, but their highest exposure risk varied spatially, with high risk defined as > 0.25 on a normalized scale of low (0) to high (1) risk. The highest vessel exposure risk for spotted dolphins occurred in deeper, offshore waters, while the highest risk for bottlenose dolphins was in shallow, coastal waters. The vessel categories with the largest area of high risk to spotted dolphins were tour vessel and commercial fishing vessel traffic, while commercial transportation traffic had the highest exposure risk for bottlenose dolphins. This article provides baseline information for understanding the vulnerability of two island-associated dolphin populations to the threat of vessel traffic and highlights the differences in relative exposure risk based on species and vessel categories. © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.All Rights Reserved

ABSTRACT: The investigation into the social organization and population biology of cetaceans, as top predator and important sentinels of the health of the marine ecosystems, provides opportunities to study responses to anthropogenic disturbance and provides useful information for the development of conservation and management plans. Thus, in the present work the association pattern of 76 photo-identified individuals of Risso's dolphin sighted at least 5 times in the Gulf of Taranto, from July 2013 to September 2021, was analyzed to describe their population social structure, providing new important evidence for the conservation of the species. Indeed, even though most of our results seems to describe a fission fusion social structure, characteristic of a not isolated or socially segregated community, a certain degree of preferred association within individuals, sex and age classes supports the hypothesis of a more complex and structured society. Further studies are needed to investigate this scenario.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Marine megafauna plays an important functional role in marine ecosystems as top predators but are threatened by a wide range of anthropogenic activities. Bycatch, the incidental capture of non-targeted species in commercial and recreational fisheries, is of particular concern for small cetacean species, such as dolphins and porpoises. In the North-East Atlantic, common dolphin (Delphinus delphis, Linné 1758) bycatch has been increasing and associated with large numbers of animals stranding during winter on the French Atlantic seashore since at least 2017. However, uncertainties around the true magnitude of common dolphin bycatch and the fisheries involved have led to delays in the implementation of mitigation measures. Current data collection on dolphin bycatch in France is with non-dedicated observers deployed on vessels for the purpose of national fisheries sampling programmes. These data cannot be assumed representative of the whole fisheries' bycatch events. This feature makes it difficult to use classic ratio estimators since they require a truly randomised sample of the fishery by dedicated observers. We applied a newly developed approach, regularised multilevel regression with post-stratification, to estimate total bycatch from unrepresentative samples and total fishing effort. The latter is needed for post-stratification and the former is analysed in a Bayesian framework with multilevel regression to regularise and better predict bycatch risk. We estimated the number of bycaught dolphins for each week and 10 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions from 2004 to 2020 by estimating jointly bycatch risk, haul duration, and the number of hauls per days at sea (DaS). Bycatch risk in pair trawlers flying the French flag was the highest in winter 2017 and 2019 and was associated with the longest haul durations. ICES divisions 8.a and 8.b (shelf part of the Bay of Biscay) were estimated to have the highest common dolphin bycatch. Our results were consistent with independent estimates of common dolphin bycatch from strandings. Our method show cases how non-representative observer data can nevertheless be analysed to estimate fishing duration, bycatch risk and, ultimately, the number of bycaught dolphins. These weekly-estimates improve upon current knowledge of the nature of common dolphin bycatch and can be used to inform management and policy decisions at a finer spatio-temporal scale than has been possible to date. Our results suggest that limiting haul duration, especially in winter, could serve as an effective mitigation strategy.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic characteristics of bubble production by an odontocete were documented for the first time. Bubble sounds produced by the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) were recorded incidentally as part of a survey of fish sounds in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve of Peru on six dates between 4 and 24 July 2012. Dolphins were observed to periodically produce large clouds of bubbles underneath or near the survey boat (averaging 7/survey or 8/h) as it drifted through areas of actively foraging dolphins. The bubble production was classified as bubble bursts due to their similarity to bubble bursts produced by other cetaceans. Bubble burst sounds had a mean peak frequency of 402 Hz and duration of 8.9 s (n = 51). Bubble bursts were temporally clustered with an average interval of 169 s (0.1 to 1,187 s) between bursts. Bubble bursts were disproportionately more likely to be present when fish sounds were also present, but it is not known if the association was due to predation or other factors. A review of the literature finds similar bubble production has been reported in at least 14 other species of cetaceans (4 mysticetes and 10 odontocetes). Most are commonly associated with play, surprise, agonistic, and foraging behaviors. We discuss each of these possibilities and conclude that Amazon river dolphin bubble burst behavior is most likely related to foraging or aggressive behavior because the behavior occurred in feeding areas and appeared to be directed at the drifting boat. We further propose a novel hypothesis that the bubble bursts are a hunting strategy used to disperse prey associated with floating vegetation mats and other forms of drifting materials used by fishes for shelter. Future research is needed to better understand the behavior associated with bubble production by the Amazon river dolphin. © 2022. Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: The presence of Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) in Southern Calabrian waters of the Ionian Sea is poorly known. During dedicated cetacean research started in the summer of 2019 in the stretch of Calabrian waters between Brancaleone and Botricello, a pod of Risso’s dolphins was recorded for the first time. This observation occurred of Siderno and Locri at about 8.3 km from the shore where the sea depth is 720 m, a bathymetric feature that is in line with the known deeper water habitat preference of the species. This Risso’s dolphin pod was composed of at least 14 individuals. The latter were photo-identified. One individual showed signs of a serious injury due to a probable vessel accident that severed partly into its back behind its dorsal fin. Most of the individuals observed were mature to old with their frontal area already light grey to white. This scientific report contributes new knowledge on the distribution of the species in the Central Mediterranean Sea which may better address effective conservation management efforts for the species. Further monitoring and management are needed for this endangered species, especially in a geographic area that was previously unstudied for an extended period, despite past stranding events and citizen sightings of cetaceans being recorded occasionally. © 2022, Natural and Engineering Science.

ABSTRACT: Despite being a very coastal species, knowledge about franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) behavior is very scarce. This chapter aims to summarize information available in the literature as well as unpublished data involving different aspects related to the behavior of the species. Franciscana is a social species, forming aggregations of up to 20–50 animals. The chapter covers aspects related to group behavior, diving and surface behavior, interspecific relationships, reactions to boats and aircraft, movement patterns, and site fidelity, in addition to inferences about the mating system, group structure, and feeding behavior, drawn from different data sources. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In comparison with terrestrial mammals, dolphins require a large amount of haemoglobin in blood and myoglobin in muscle to prolong their diving time underwater and increase the depth they can dive. The genus Cetobacterium is a common gastrointestinal bacterium in dolphins and includes two species: C. somerae and C. ceti. Whilst the former produces vitamin B12, which is essential for the biosynthesis of haem, a component of haemoglobin and myoglobin, but not produced by mammals, the production ability of the latter remains unknown. The present study aimed to isolate C. ceti from dolphins and reveal its ability to biosynthesize vitamin B12 . Three strains of C. ceti, identified by phylogenetic analyses with 16S rRNA gene and genome-based taxonomy assignment and biochemical features, were isolated from faecal samples collected from two captive common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). A microbioassay using Lactobacillus leichmannii ATCC 7830 showed that the average concentration of vitamin B12 produced by the three strains was 11 (standard deviation: 2) pg ml−1. The biosynthesis pathway of vitamin B12, in particular, adenosylcobalamin, was detected in the draft genome of the three strains using blastKOALA. This is the first study to isolate C. ceti from common bottlenose dolphins and reveal its ability of vitamin B12 biosynthesis, and our find-ings emphasize the importance of C. ceti in supplying haemoglobin and myoglobin to dolphins. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The coastal waters of Bago City and Pulupandan are core habitats of the critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), and the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA) is seen as a crucial strategy in ensuring their conservation. However, the sustainability of the MPA depends on the participation of those who have greater stakes as resource users, the fisherfolk communities. This paper describes and assays the experiences and issues on how fisherfolk organizations were engaged in conservation-based alternative livelihood and protection of the habitats of Irrawaddy dolphins. Using qualitative methods, rapid community appraisal, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and workshops were conducted involving eight fisherfolk organizations. A conservation-based alternative livelihood framework was adopted in engaging the fisherfolk communities, which was drawn from the concepts of the sustainable alternative livelihoods approach (SALA) and the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Community organizing processes and development principles were observed, such as ensuring that activities are undertaken to be participatory and community-based in approaches. The experiences in engaging fisherfolk organizations yielded some issues and lessons: poverty remains a barrier to conservation; how to contend with the strong dole-out mentality among members; community building as an organizing approach was short-lived; the support of local government units; and the vital role of women in conservation and community development. The study suggests a shift in the community organizing approach towards consensus organizing because environmental conservation necessitates the involvement of various stakeholders. © 2022 The authors.

ABSTRACT: Kylie is a solitary common dolphin who inhabits a restricted area within the Firth of Clyde (Scotland). She spends most of her time around navigational buoys in the Hunterston/Fairlie channel, where she has been seen interacting with harbour porpoises. Recordings from 2016 and 2017 were used to study her acoustic behaviour when seen alone and with a porpoise. Clicks were classified as potential porpoise or dolphin clicks based on the waveform, power spectrum, and spectrogram, as well as direction of arrival, inter-click interval, amplitude, and centroid frequency variations. Kylie emitted clicks exclusively, which were of variable nature, including low, mid, and high-frequency (HF, centroid frequency > 100 kHz) as well as broad or narrowband. Some of Kylie’s HF clicks were similar to porpoise clicks both in the time (e.g. polycyclic) and frequency (e.g. narrowband with most energy between 100 and 150 kHz) domains, which cannot fully be explained by recording geometry and directionality effects. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Three stocks of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are currently known to co‐occur in the coastal waters off Virginia. A combination of visual line‐transect survey and photo‐identification (photo‐ID) methods was used to gather information on the occurrence, distribution and density of bottlenose dolphins in the coastal areas of Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Sixty‐one line‐transect surveys were completed in two zones (inshore and offshore) between August 2012 and August 2015, with on-effort coverage of 6,550 kilometres (km) of trackline over 349.6 hours. Conventional line‐transect analysis of bottlenose dolphin sightings showed both spatial and temporal variation in density (D) and abundance (N), with highest density in the inshore zone during warm‐water months (June–November). Inshore densities were calculated as 3.51 individuals per square kilometre (km2) (N = 1,090) in the warm‐water season and 0.73 individuals/km2 (N = 225) in cool‐water months (December–May). Densities in the offshore zone were 1.24 individuals/km2 (N = 741) in the warm-water season and 0.61 individuals/km2 (N = 366) in the cool‐water season. Warm‐water density peaks support previous research; however, this study documents a cold‐season presence of dolphins in both zones not previously reported. Twenty‐seven photo‐ID surveys were completed and a photo‐ID catalogue was created using photos taken during both dedicated photo‐ID and line‐transect surveys, containing 1,335 unique individuals. Re‐sighting numbers were low, with less than 17% of individuals documented on more than one occasion, and only 4% sighted on three or more occasions, with a maximum of 4 re‐sightings. Days between re‐sightings ranged from 5 to 970, though distance between re‐sightings spanning greater time was minimal (less than 25km). Sighting locations of photo‐IDed dolphins were broken into three regions to investigate seasonal and spatial patterns of individual distribution; dolphins sighted only in the Cape Henry (CH) or Inner Bay (IB) region were observed mostly during summer and fall seasons (93% CH, 100% IB) with none occurring during winter. For the Outer Coastline (OC) region, the majority of sightings (88%) occurred during fall and winter. Additionally, there were two individuals sighted during winter months also sighted during summer more than 130km to the north inside Chesapeake Bay (matched to a different catalogue). These sightings support the possibility that the current stock structure does not account for all dolphins in the region. Stock structure as currently understood is complicated, with overlapping spatial distribution of three stocks that separate seasonally. Our study provides information that may be useful for management, but also additional findings that could impact future stock designations. © 2022 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: The Risso’s dolphin, Grampus griseus, is widely distributed in temperate and tropical ocean waters around the world. Despite the known occurrence along the Brazilian coast, information regarding the spatial distribution of the species is scarce. Here we evaluated the distribution pattern of Risso’s dolphins using records obtained through 200 h of dedicated aerial surveys for marine mammals of the slope and outer continental shelf of Southeast Brazil, conducted between March and May 2012. A total of 16 groups of Risso’s dolphins was recorded with a median group size of 35 individuals (range = 1-300). Environmental variables (i.e., depth, slope, distance to the coast and to the shelf break, and sea surface temperature) associated with the Risso’s dolphin groups recorded indicate an oceanic distribution pattern, occurring close to the shelf break, what is probably related with foraging activity. This study provides new information about the distribution of Risso’s dolphins in Brazilian waters, and could be used as basis to plan conservation actions. © 2022, SAREM Sociedad Argentina para el Estudio de los Mamiferos.

ABSTRACT: Companies like SeaWorld claim that the dolphins in their facilities “thrive.” Relying on Martha Nussbaum’s “capabilities approach,” this chapter argues that cetaceans in entertainment facilities are systematically prevented from enjoying the conditions necessary for cetacean “flourishing.” The scientific research over at least the last 50 years shows that dolphins have evolved to have sophisticated intellectual and emotional abilities that make them vulnerable to a wide range of pain and suffering. When the life of a captive orca is compared to that of an orca living in its natural habitat, it is clear that hardly any dolphin capacities can be achieved. Instead of a life of close relationships, meaningful activity and funktionslust, captive cetaceans live empty, unhealthy lives in conditions, as Nussbaum would say, that are far from what “cetacean dignity” requires. As a result, captivity harms cetaceans so seriously and on so many different fronts, these dolphins should be seen as victims of “cruelty.” In addition, SeaWorld’s ethical failures are compounded by the harm the company also does to its customers, investors and employees in conducting business on such a weak ethical footing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) regularly display agonistic behaviors and aggression toward members of their own species (Connor et al., 1992; Samuels & Gifford, 1997; Scott et al., 2005) and other species (Ross & Wilson, 1996; May-Collado, 2010; Cotter et al., 2012). These interactions are typically not lethal but sometimes involve mortality (Ross & Wilson, 1996; Patterson et al., 1998; Dunn et al., 2002). Dolphins often direct this aggression toward conspecific calves—ramming, tossing, and attempting to submerge them, sometimes intensely enough to cause long-term harm or infanticide—the intentional killing of an infant by conspecifics (Kaplan et al., 2009; Robinson, 2014; Ronje et al., 2020). Reports of agonistic and infanticidal behavior in multiple populations of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) suggest these behaviors may not be uncommon. © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.All Rights Reserved

ABSTRACT: The topographic distribution of retinal ganglion cells was investigated in a retinal wholemount of an Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris). Two zones of increased concentration of ganglion cells were observed—one in the temporal segment and the other in the nasal segment of the retina. The maximal cell concentration was 250 cell/mm2 in the temporal area and 194 cell/mm2 in the nasal area. Based on the posterior nodal distance of 11 mm, the resolution was evaluated as 19.8 arc min in the temporal retinal area (the frontal visual field) and 22.4 arc min in the nasal retinal area (the temporal visual field). Among retinal ganglion cells, a group of giant cells that ranged from 42 to 52 μm in diameter were observed; these cells represented 8% of the total population. The obtained data allowed us to suggest that the presence of two areas of concentrated ganglion cells is characteristic of many delphinids inhabiting both clear oceanic waters or turbid river waters, whereas low ganglion cell density is associated with optic properties of the media. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Despite significant research effort in the past decade was done to better understand the effect of noise on cetaceans, remarkable gaps still remain, especially in understanding the patterns of the vocalizations emitted in different behavioural contexts. This study focused on the bioacoustics of the striped dolphin in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central Mediterranean Sea) in order to understand possible differences in emission rate of whistles, clicks, burst pulses and buzzes depending on the behavioural and size of groups observed. Results demonstrated that both the behavioural context and the group size affect the vocalizations emission rate although with effects that are not always generalizable. However, studies on this issue should be strongly encouraged to disentangle the effect of anthropogenic noise on cetaceans.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Although banned for years, organochlorine pesticides and PCBs continue to affect aquatic life, dolphins being particularly exposed. The concentrations of 31 PCB congeners, and 15 banned pesticides or metabolites were measured in 5 tissues of 68 striped dolphins stranded in the Northwestern Mediterranean coast in 2010–16. The results were compared to historical data (1988–2009) and, even though there is a slow decreasing trend, the levels in the 2010–2016 samples were still elevated based on common cetacean toxicological thresholds. A transition period in 2007–08, probably caused by a morbillivirus epizootic amplified the stranding, espacially of highly contaminated specimens. From 2010, higher proportions in parent compounds towards metabolites were observed yet again. These changing patterns were likely reflect the exposure of dolphins to the remobilization of pollutants from contaminated soils and sediments, with a prominent role of rivers. This should lead to an even slower decline of these contaminants that could last for decades, requiring new efforts to reduce their dispersal to aquatic ecosystems. © 2021

ABSTRACT: According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Southeastern Pacific (SEP) subpopulation of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, Desmoulins, 1822; SRWs) is critically endangered with ≤ 50 mature individuals left (Cooke, 2018). Most of the ~4.5 annual sightings in Chile concentrate between 18° and 25° S, and near 33° S (Aguayo-Lobo et al., 2008; also see Thiel et al., 2007; Pavés et al., 2020). South of 40° S, the coastal waters of Isla Chiloé, Los Lagos Region (see Figure 1), seem to be important for the subpopulation, possibly including habitat for reproductive behavior (Galletti Vernazzani et al., 2014). Data from the northwardly adjacent Los Ríos Region (near 40° S; see Figure 1) are scarce (Aguayo-Lobo et al., 2008; Galletti Vernazzani et al., 2014). Anecdotal reports are therefore of scientific and conservation value. This paper comprises detailed behavioral observations meant to enhance the understanding of, and to encourage further research on, SEP SRW social and ecological functioning and needs. It also covers SRW behavior not yet reported for this subpopulation, and it represents the first documentation of interspecific interaction between SRWs and Peale’s dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis, Peale, 1848; PDs) in the SEP © 2022, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Understanding species’ distribution patterns and the environmental and ecological interactions that drive them is fundamental for biodiversity conservation. Data deficiency exists in areas that are difficult to access, or where resources are limited. We use a broad-scale, non-targeted dataset to describe dolphin distribution and habitat suitability in remote north Western Australia, where there is a paucity of data to adequately inform species management. From 1,169 opportunistic dolphin sightings obtained from 10 dugong aerial surveys conducted over a four-year period, there were 661 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), 191 Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis), nine Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni), 16 Stenella sp., one killer whale (Orcinus orca), one false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and 290 unidentified dolphin species sightings. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) habitat suitability models identified shallow intertidal areas around mainland coast, islands and shoals as important areas for humpback dolphins. In contrast, bottlenose dolphins are more likely to occur further offshore and at greater depths, suggesting niche partitioning between these two sympatric species. Bottlenose dolphin response to sea surface temperature is markedly different between seasons (positive in May; negative in October) and probably influenced by the Leeuwin Current, a prominent oceanographic feature. Our findings support broad marine spatial planning, impact assessment and the design of future surveys, which would benefit from the collection of high-resolution digital images for species identification verification. A substantial proportion of data were removed due to uncertainties resulting from non-targeted observations and this is likely to have reduced model performance. We highlight the importance of considering climatic and seasonal fluctuations in interpreting distribution patterns and species interactions in assuming habitat suitability.

ABSTRACT: Analysis of animal morphometrics can provide vital information regarding population dynamics, structure, and body condition of cetaceans. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become the primary tool to collect morphometric measurements on whales, whereas on free ranging small dolphins, have not yet been applied. This study assesses the feasibility of obtaining reliable body morphometrics from Australian snubfin (Orcaella heinsohni) and humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) using images collected from UAVs. Specifically, using a dolphin replica of known size, we tested the effect of the altitude of the UAV and the position of the animal within the image frame on the accuracy of length estimates. Using linear mixed models, we further assessed the precision of the total length estimates of humpback and snubfin dolphins. The precision of length estimates on the replica increased by ~2% when images were sampled at 45–60 m compared with 15–30 m. However, the precision of total length estimates on dolphins was significantly influenced only by the degree of arch and edge certainty. Overall, we obtained total length estimates with a precision of ~3% and consistent with published data. This study demonstrates the reliability of using UAV based images to obtain morphometrics of small dolphin species, such as snubfin and humpback dolphins. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Human interaction (HI) is known to disturb cetaceans. Regional wildlife interaction guidelines exist to mitigate harmful impacts, but the efficacy of these guidelines is understudied. HI with bottlenose dolphins was documented opportunistically in Tampa Bay from 2009 to 2018. Vessel compliance to the guidelines was low with 80% of encounters being non-compliant. HI was observed in 33% of days in the field and in 22% of dolphin sightings. Poisson regression identified vessel type as a strong key factor related to compliance, with faster more maneuverable boats more likely to be non-compliant. Additionally, HI involved recreational vessels much more frequently than tourism vessels. These results likely underestimate true HI rates because of sampling limitations. Researchers should opportunistically document HI including vessel characteristics and vessel behavior to help quantify compliance. When developing HI guidelines and their promotion, managers should carefully consider which stakeholders engage in HI to best direct resources to that audience. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The main threat of franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) is the incidental bycatch in artisanal fishing gillnets. Several studies were implemented during the past two decades along with the local fishing communities in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina in order to address this conservation issue. Acoustic deterrent devices, commonly known as “pingers”, were shown to be one of the most effective bycatch mitigation method. Bottom longlines were tested as alternative fishing gear and resulted in reduced bycatch but fishermen found them difficult to implement. Gillnets modified to be acoustically reflective and have greater stiffness were ineffictive for reducing bycatch. The conclusions from this body of research is important for informing effective strategies for mitigating franciscana bycatch. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The glycopatterns of the glycans secreted by the mucosa of stomach and duodenal ampulla of the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba were studied by histochemical (Periodic acid-Schiff, Alcian Blue pH 2.5, High Iron Diamine) and lectin-binding (SBA, DBA, PNA, WGA, MAA-II, SNA, ConA, UEA-I, AAA, LTA) techniques. The stomach can be divided into four compartments: main stomach, two connecting chambers and pylorus. The pylorus is followed by the duodenal ampulla. Mucins are secreted by surface cells and intramucosal glands specific for each compartment. In the main stomach glands, neck cells were weakly sulphated, with prevailing glycosaminylated, glycosylated/mannosylated, and fucosylated residuals. Parietal and chief cells in general were scarcely reactive. In the connecting chambers glands, there were high levels of sulphation, glycosaminylation, glycosylation/mannosylation, and fucosylation, the latter with more complex patterns than those observed in the main stomach glands. In the pyloric glands sulphated, glycosaminylated and fucosylated residuals decreased, whereas the opposite was observed for galactosyl/galactosaminylated residuals. Glycosylation patterns in the glands of the duodenal ampulla differed from those of the pyloric ones, with similar levels of sulphation, lower levels of galactosyl/galactosaminylation and glycosaminylation, and higher level of fucosylation. The results are compared with those available in literature. © 2021 The Authors. Marine Mammal Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) and Irrawaddy (Orcaella brevirostris) dolphins are commonly found in Matang waters, Perak, Malaysia. The area, filled with healthy mangrove forest cover and many estuaries, is not only frequented by the dol phins for its daily activities but also extensively used by locals for artisanal fishing, charcoal production and organizing ecotourism activities. There could be a high risk of human-dolphin interactions, hence determining habitat use and identifying crit ical habitats or "hot spots" for the dolphins in the area is important. In this study, a series of dedicated boat sighting surveys were conducted from March 2019 to January 2021 between Kuala Gula and Kuala Jarum Mas. The total survey effort was 3325.76 km, 44 days and 239.38 hours. A total of 69 dolphin sightings were made, consisting of 40 Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and 29 Irrawaddy dolphin observations, respectively. During each sighting, every dolphin's behaviors were categorized as: foraging, socializing, evasive, and travelling, and the survey area was classified into four blocks. The results indicated that different dolphin species have different hotspot areas. For Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, the hotspot area was Kuala Sangga, while the Irrawaddy dolphin's hotspot area was outside Kuala Larut, and there was a small overlap between the two dolphins' hotspots. Among the recorded behaviors (n: 281) for both dolphins, the most dominant was foraging (72.24%), followed by socializing (17%), evasive (7%), and travelling (4%). The sighted foraging behavior for both dolphin populations was dominant, indicating the hot spots were major foraging grounds for the two dolphin populations. This study shows the importance of Matang waters as a conservation area for the species and warrants further studies of dolphin population ecology to be conducted. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

ABSTRACT: Melanin is the group of pigments found in the skin of animals, and the quantity determines coloration patterns. Variations in the production of melanin has been linked to different disorders (for a review, see Braun-Falco et al., 2000). For example, hypopigmentation, those with reduced melanin production, include albinism (total absence of pigmentation; skin is white and eyes are shades of red) and leucism (deficiency of pigmentation; skin is abnormally pigmented often in shades of white or tan and eyes are a normal color) (Fertl & Rosel, 2018; Olson & Allen, 2019; Hauser-Davis et al., 2020; Walsh, 2020). © 2022, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The Indus River dolphin (Platanista minor) is an endangered species found in the Indus River system of Pakistan including Beas River in India which is a part of Indus River system, enlisted in Appendix I of CITES Red List of threatened species. Currently, the whole population across the Indus River in Pakistan is divided into four subpopulations. Although photo-identification efforts on freshwater dolphins were successfully made on the Irrawady dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) in South Asia, Baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) in the Yangtze River of China, and the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) in South America, it is very difficult to take photographs of Indus river dolphin. From March 1 to 9 in 2019, a survey was conducted in the area covered in a branch of approximately 70 km of the Indus River from Taunsa barrage (District Muzaffargarh, Tehsil Kott Addu) to just downstream of Ghazi Ghat near Samina (District Dera Ghazi Khan) in Punjab, Pakistan. We successfully photographed and first reported seven types of skin marks originated from their natural or social interactions and anthropogenic activities. Dead bodies of five calves were collected from two different subpopulations in the Punjab river section, two from the Chashma-Taunsa and three from the Taunsa-Guddu barrage. Illegal hunting of Indus river dolphin and utilization of blubber in upstream areas of Punjab is still in practice. Anthropogenic threats are needed to be evaluated for long-term conservation of this endangered species to reduce conflict and mortality in areas where fishing is under practice.

ABSTRACT: Irrawaddy Dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris (Owen in Gray, 1866), has been reported in the waters of Berbak Sembilang National Park, Indonesia, since 1990. We used interview techniques, direct observations, and secondary data from the literature to show that this dolphin occurs on the east coast of South Sumatra from October to February. An Irrawaddy Dolphin bycatch was recorded on 26 January 2021 in a gillnet. There have been historical sightings of fewer than six individuals of Irrawaddy Dolphins between 1990 and 2013 in the estuaries of Bogem, Bungin, Ngirawan, Terusan Dalam, Betet Island, Banyuasin, Lalan, and Tanjung Carat to Makarti Jaya. We map the geographic distribution of Irrawaddy Dolphin in South Sumatra. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Modification of river flows by dams and barrages has fragmented riverine habitats and threatened the survival of Indian subcontinental river dolphins. In this study, habitat use by endangered Ganges river dolphins in response to dry-season operations (December-March) of the Farakka barrage on the Ganga River, located about 20 km upstream of the India–Bangladesh border, was assessed. Ten surveys were conducted in: (i) the Ganga River below the barrage, where rapid changes in water levels were expected owing to barrage operations; (ii) the Farakka feeder canal with stable water levels; and (iii) the Hooghly River downstream of the canal. Dolphin distribution, water depth, fishing boat count and temperature were recorded in all surveys and the data were analysed in a dynamic occupancy modelling framework. Temporal trends in river discharge, primary productivity and fish availability were also estimated to explain river dolphin responses. Occupancy and colonization by dolphins increased in all stretches by spring/March, correlated with rising water temperature and increased fishing intensity, which was related to upstream migration of hilsa fish. In the Ganga River, dolphin occupancy in deep river pools remained stable, but resulted in increased overlap with fisheries as river flow declined. The feeder canal, with stable flows, witnessed increased colonization by dolphins, but also greater risk of bycatch in fishing nets. The canal that appeared as a hydrological refuge thus became an ‘ecological trap’. The findings highlight the need for integration of flow maintenance and fishery regulations in the monitoring and management of canals as effective refuges for riverine species. We advocate the inclusion of ecological flow criteria and fishery regulations to reduce dolphin bycatch mortality, in the context of establishing river dolphin conservation plans and transboundary water-sharing guidelines. The revision of the India–Bangladesh water-sharing treaty in 2026 could incorporate the above considerations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans are species indicator of the ecosystem health status. It is necessary to increase knowledge on them to support the conservation of these species and their habitat. New strategy, based on machine learning techniques, has been adopted to estimate cetacean group size. Starting from Risso's dolphin sighting data in the Ionian Sea collected between 2009 and 2019, the aim of this work is to build a correlative model which can help in estimating Risso's dolphin group size, by using a set of physical and biogeochemical features.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Lower-extremity muscle strength and ankle flexibility play key roles in underwater swimming movements. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between knee isokinetic strength and the speed of underwater dolphin kicks (UDK-S) in competitive male swimmers and identify whether ankle flexibility affects the association between knee isokinetic strength and UDK-S. METHODS: Fifty-two highly trained male swimmers participated in this study. The speed at which the participants travelled 15 m performing UDKs was calculated as UDK-S. Knee flexor and extensor concentric isokinetic strength at fast (240/s) and slow (60/s) velocities and ankle flexibility were evaluated. Bayesian framework analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between these variables and determine whether this relationship is influenced by ankle flexibility. RESULTS: There was strong-to-extremely strong evidence (Bayes factor = 24.4 to 198.3) that knee extensor (60/s) and knee flexor (60/s and 240/s) strength are positively and generally moderately correlated with UDK-S. Ankle plantar flexion flexibility was identified to be a moderator between knee extensor strength (60/s) and UDK-S. CONCLUSIONS: Knee extensor and knee flexor strength were significantly correlated with UDK-S, and the relationship between knee muscle strength and UDK-S was influenced by ankle plantar flexion flexibility in male competitive swimmers.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

ABSTRACT: Age estimating wild dolphins using noninvasive methods will improve our understanding of their ontogeny. Speckles appear on the ventral through to the lateral areas of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) as they age. Age-related changes in the speckle density and shape were examined using type classification. Speckles first appeared on the ventral area of the genital area at approximately 6.5 years. They increased in two specific directions, from the genital area to the jaw and from the ventral side to the lateral side. The speckle shape changed with aging from a dot-shape to oblong. Individuals aged over 35 years possessed more speckles than those aged 24–26 years. The oldest age category of dolphins in this study was over 35 years. The speckling area similarly increased with age for all individuals. Therefore, the results suggest that speckle condition can be used to estimate age. The relationship between speckling area and age showed no significant sexual dimorphism except near the genital slit area. There was no speckle area around the genital slit which differed in shape between the sexes. Therefore, speckle patch shape may be a useful sex confirmation tool. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Marine predator foraging influences community structure and ecosystem functions, which are all linked with environmental variables. Determining variables that are associated with foraging can facilitate the identification of important habitats, which is particularly important in heavily urbanized systems. In the New York−New Jersey Harbor Estuary, bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are exposed to various stressors, including vessel activity and forthcoming offshore wind development. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring to identify foraging conditions for dolphins from April−October of 2018−2020. When foraging, dolphins produce a series of rapid clicks (‘foraging buzzes’) which can be used as a proxy for foraging activity. We analyzed the relationship between acoustic detections of dolphins and environmental variables using a generalized additive modeling framework. The variables week, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration were significantly associated with foraging activity at seasonal timescales. Foraging increased with increasing SST and water levels, with the peak of foraging occurring in autumn. The relationship between chl a concentration and foraging was not straightforward and warrants further research. Diel foraging trends varied seasonally and annually. These results suggest that passive acoustic monitoring and environmental variables may be used to investigate marine mammal behavior and assess seasonal foraging habitat for marine predators within dynamic, heterogenous, and human-dominated environments. Baseline data on dolphin habitat use is vital given the continued expansion of anthropogenic activities and climate-driven shifts in oceanographic conditions that are occurring in this region. © Inter-Research 2022

ABSTRACT: Across their worldwide distribution, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) use a variety of techniques to detect, pursue, and capture prey. Dolphins may hunt independently or in groups, and specialized foraging behaviors have been identified at both the individual and population levels. These behaviors can involve tool use (Patterson & Mann, 2011), coordinated herding of prey (Engleby & Powell, 2019), benthic foraging techniques (Rossbach & Herzing, 1997), and even cooperative interactions with fishermen (Daura-Jorge et al., 2012). In many bay, sound, and estuary populations along the U.S. coast, dolphins have developed foraging strategies that incorporate local habitat features (Wells, 2019). For example, along the southeast coast of the U.S., strand-feeding dolphins utilize exposed mud and sand banks to drive prey onto shore (Hoese, 1971; Fox & Young, 2012). Other strategies are more specifically adapted to target and handle individual prey species. For instance, in the northern Gulf of Mexico, several dolphin populations have developed a technique to remove the spiny heads from catfish (Ariidae), consuming the remaining bodies (Ronje et al., 2017). © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.All Rights Reserved

ABSTRACT: Estimates of the energetic costs of locomotion (COL) at different activity levels are necessary to answer fundamental eco-physiological questions and to understand the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance to marine mammals. We combined estimates of energetic costs derived from breath-by-breath respirometry with measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) from biologging tags to validate ODBA as a proxy for COL in trained common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR); mean individual RMR was 0.71–1.42 times that of a similarly sized terrestrial mammal and agreed with past measurements that used breath-by-breath and flow-through respirometry. We also measured energy expenditure during submerged swim trials, at primarily moderate exercise levels. We subtracted RMR to obtain COL, and normalized COL by body size to incorporate individual swimming efficiencies. We found both mass-specific energy expenditure and mass-specific COL were linearly related with ODBA. Measurements of activity level and cost of transport (the energy required to move a given distance) improve understanding of the COL in marine mammals. The strength of the correlation between ODBA and COL varied among individuals, but the overall relationship can be used at a broad scale to estimate the energetic costs of disturbance and daily locomotion costs to build energy budgets, and investigate the costs of diving in free-ranging animals where bio-logging data are available. We propose that a similar approach could be applied to other cetacean species. © 2022. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The paper describes the autonomous virtual UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) using a visual detection model to track the Taiwanese white dolphins. In this research, the SITL simulator (Software in the Loop) runs ArduPilot on the machine. ArduPilot is an autopilot system for autonomous vehicles, which is installed on the virtual drone. The simulation helps evaluate the detection model and the tracking system prior we launch the drone out over the ocean where the consequences of mistakes can be very expensive. The customized YOLO v4 model has been trained on the Taiwanese White Dolphin Image dataset 201S owned by Cetacean Lab in NTU. The model has the ability to detect the side view of the white dolphin under 702 pixels@0.5AP (Average Precision) in the real-sea footage. The model's proper detection condition such as the distance between the white dolphin and the drone, the height above the horizon, and the pitching angle of the camera, is estimated by the simulation in the paper as well. A white dolphin 3D model is sculpted and textured based on the real white dolphin called Doufu with Blender software. In the Gazebo Simulator, the 3D dolphin model moves in the shapes of a rectangle, circle, and figure-eight with a constant velocity of 10 knots on the water. With the frame caught on the virtual drone camera and the detection model, the virtual drone can track the dolphin without losing it under certain conditions. The Taiwanese White dolphin (subspecies of Sousa chinensis) is listed as critically endangered [1]. And the population is decreasing year by year. The real-time monitoring of the Taiwanese White dolphin is still unlikely to be realized unless we launch the drones, send the hydrophones to the sea, and establish the individual PHOTO ID and AUDIO ID. It is hoped that people can take advantage of this system, run different varieties of simulations, and Figure out a better algorithm running through those possibilities to help monitor and conserve the white dolphins.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: A central task of zoos and aquaria is the frequent and accurate assessment of their animals’ welfare. Recently, important steps have been made, such as the introduction of animal welfare evaluation tools and welfare decision trees. To determine animal welfare, it is not only important to collect life history data, such as longevity and reproductive success, but also for experienced observers or caretakers to conduct behavioral observations on a regular basis to assess animals’ emotional state. To physiologically validate welfare observations, glucocorticoid levels are usually assessed, as they are a common indicator of stress. While, for many animals, these levels can be easily determined via fecal or hair samples, for cetaceans, the levels are usually determined via blood samples. As blood samples cannot be taken very frequently and the process may cause stress to the animals (if the samples are not taken following medical training), other techniques, such as the measurement of health biomarkers (especially cortisol, which can be measured in saliva), have become the focus of cetacean stress research. However, there are two problems associated with saliva measurements in cetaceans: saliva might either be diluted with pool water or be contaminated by fodder fish, as frozen fish usually contains high levels of cortisol. In our study, we investigated how saliva cortisol levels are connected to blood cortisol levels and how saliva cortisol can be influenced by fodder fish. We examined saliva and blood samples in eleven bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) kept in an outdoor and indoor facility in Germany. Furthermore, we assessed the cortisol levels of different kinds of fodder fish. Our data show that, although saliva cortisol values are elevated under stress and arousal, they seem not to be correlated with blood cortisol values. We also show that, after feeding, saliva cortisol values are increased up to 100-fold. Our results suggest that saliva cortisol measurements in dolphins have to be conducted and considered with care, as they can easily be contaminated. Moreover, it is important to use the right laboratory method in order to specifically detect cortisol; in our study, we conducted reliable tests, using LC-MS/MS. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations of lower limb power and jump height in the SJ, CMJ, ACMJ and CJ30s tests with time, speed, force, power, and work done during dolphin kick. Methods: Seventeen female swimmers and seventeen male swimmers of an elite swimming sports school in Poland participated in the study. The parameters being recorded and used in the analysis were the jump height and lower limb power in jump tests. In the test of 25 meters of dolphin kick in swimming at maximum pace, the results used in the analysis were the mean values of time, velocity, power, force and work. Results were expressed as means ± standard deviations. Descriptive statistics of the groups were then compiled to finally perform Pearson correlation calculations. Results: The highest correlations occurred between lower limb power during jumps and swimming speed, especially for men in the ACMJ (r = 0.5468, p = 0.023) and SJ (r = 0.5411, r = 0.025) tests. Jump height was not as often and strongly correlated with swimming time and speed as lower limb power. An important observation is that no statistically significant correlations were found for power, force and work during dolphin kick with lower limb power and jump height. Conclusions: The present study showed strong correlations between the performance variables of swimmers on dry land and in water. The most important finding is that the power during all the jumps (ACMJ, SJ, CJ30s and CMJ) was strongly correlated with the time and speed of swimming using dolphin kick. © 2022, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

ABSTRACT: The Māui dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) is an endemic subspecies of Hector’s dolphin (C. h. hectori) found in the coastal waters off the west coast, North Island of Aotearoa New Zealand. They are thought to have been isolated from populations of Hector’s dolphins around the South Island for about 15,000years. The two subspecies differ in morphology and show diagnostic differences in mitochondrial DNA. Māui dolphins are listed as “Critically Endangered” on the IUCN Red List and “Nationally Critical” in the New Zealand Threat Classification System; the most recent abundance estimate is 54 (95% CL 48, 66) dolphins, aged 1 year or older, for the period 2020–21. In 2008, a Marine Mammal Sanctuary was established to protect Māui dolphins from fisheries bycatch, thought to be responsible for a decline in abundance over the last several decades, and coastal waters were designated an IUCN Important Marine Mammal Area in 2020. Modifications to the sanctuary have been made since 2008 to increase protection from fisheries interactions but the threat of disease, in particular toxoplasmosis and brucellosis, are an increasing concern. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Atlantic humpback dolphin has been listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered since 2017, and is Africa’s most imperiled cetacean species. Occurring only along the Atlantic coast of Africa, its restricted geographic range, reliance on nearshore habitat, and naturally low abundance make it highly vulnerable to human activities. Known immediate threats include bycatch in fisheries, especially gillnets, and deliberate hunting for fishing bait and human consumption. The scale of those mortalities remains unknown, but they are suspected to be widespread. Other potential threats include habitat loss and degradation, pollution and prey depletion. Conservation management strategies are hindered by significant data deficits, lack of funding, and numerous anthropogenic factors including high levels of human poverty across the countries where the species occurs, and lack of local scientists, resources, and political will. Although the deteriorating status of the Atlantic humpback dolphin has been recognized for decades, those concerns have not yet translated into tangible management actions to stabilize or increase populations. Some Atlantic humpback dolphin populations may still have long-term viability, if habitat protection and targeted threat management are implemented. As a minimum, it is recommended that management should incorporate the development of a collaborative and transboundary species action plan, mitigation of bycatch (such as subsidies for gillnet removal), designation of managed protected areas where threats are removed, robust population assessments, increased awareness and capacity-building, and preparation for informed discussion regarding the viability of future ex situ management options. Without immediate action, the outlook for the Atlantic humpback dolphin is poor. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

ABSTRACT: Necrocoitus (historically referred to as Davian behavior) has been reported in a variety of verte-brate and invertebrate species (Dickerman, 1960; Moeliker, 2001; Izzo et al., 2012; Ashaharraza et al., 2020; Wang & Meyer-Rochow, 2020). Several marine mammal species have been observed engaging in necrocoitus, including the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis), the Pacific pilot whale (Globicephala scammonii), and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops trunca-tus), which represents the majority of cetaceans who have been observed engaging in postmortem attentive behavior (Brown, 1962; Harris et al., 2010; Bills et al., 2013; Bearzi et al., 2018; Methion & Díaz López, 2021). Most observations of post-mortem attentive behavior in cetaceans involve epimeletic behavior from a live, adult female with a dead calf (Caldwell & Caldwell, 1966; Quintana-Rizzo & Wells, 2016; Bearzi et al., 2017, 2018). In addition to epimeletic behavior, accounts of bottle-nose dolphins reacting to dead conspecifics include behavior consistent with mate-guarding, agonistic behavior, and arousal, but observed intromission is extremely rare and has not been photo documented (Brown, 1962; Dudzinski et al., 2003; Methion & Díaz López, 2021). © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: For long-lived species such as marine mammals, having sufficient data on ranging patterns and space use in a timescale suitable for population management and conservation can be difficult. Yawuru Nagulagun/Roebuck Bay in the northwest of Western Australia supports one of the largest known populations of Australian snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni)—a species with a limited distribution, vulnerable conservation status, and high cultural value. Understanding the species’ use of this area will inform management for the long-term conservation of this species. We combined 11 years of data collected from a variety of sources between 2007 and 2020 to assess the ranging patterns and site fidelity of this population. Ranging patterns were estimated using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and fixed kernel densities (weighted to account for survey effort) to estimate core and representative areas of use for both the population and for individuals. We estimated the population to range over a small area within the bay (103.05 km2). The Mean individual representative area of use (95% Kernel density contour) was estimated as 39.88 km2 (± 32.65 SD) and the Mean individual core area of use (50% Kernel density contour) was estimated as 21.66 km2 (±18.85 SD) with the majority of sightings located in the northern part of the bay less than 10 km from the coastline. Most individuals (56%) showed moderate to high levels of site fidelity (i.e., part-time or long-term residency) when individual re-sight rates were classified using agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). These results emphasize the importance of the area to this vulnerable species, particularly the area within the Port of Broome that has been identified within the population’s core range. The pressures associated with coastal development and exposure to vessel traffic, noise, and humans will need to be considered in ongoing management efforts. Analyzing datasets from multiple studies and across time could be beneficial for threatened species where little is known on their ranging patterns and site fidelity. Combined datasets can provide larger sample sizes over an extended period of time, fill knowledge gaps, highlight data limitations, and identify future research needs to be considered with dedicated studies.

ABSTRACT: An experimental study was conducted to research dolphins’ sonar adaptation capabilities for location of objects obscured by marine sediments. It was shown that dolphins are able to alter spectral and temporal characteristics of their location signals. Adaptive change in length, spectral width and amplitude of signals provides optimal tools to fight interference and allows dolphins to effectively identify objects. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) subpopulation in the Mediterranean is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This species is strictly protected in France and the designation of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) is required under the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). However, little information is available about the structure and dynamics of bottlenose dolphins in French Mediterranean waters. We collected photo-identification data over the whole French Mediterranean continental shelf year-round between 2013 and 2015. We sighted 151 groups of bottlenose dolphins allowing the individual photo-identification of 766 animals. The encounter rate distribution showed the presence of bottlenose dolphins over the whole continental shelf year-round. We estimated for the first time, using capture-recapture methods, the size of this bottlenose dolphin population at 2,350 individuals, 95% credible interval [1,827, 3,135]. Our results were used in support of the designation of a new dedicated SAC in the Gulf of Lion and provide a baseline for the bottlenose dolphin monitoring in the French Mediterranean waters in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Coastal dolphin populations are highly vulnerable due to their proximity to major urban centres and exposure to cumulative threats from anthropogenic activities. As bioindicators of environmental con-dition, it is crucial to understand and monitor the health of these coastal dolphin populations. Visual assessments of skin lesions on dolphins can provide useful insights into the health of these populations and exposure to environmental stressors. We exam-ined the prevalence of skin lesions in Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) of different age classes inhabiting the near-urban embayment of Moreton Bay, Queensland. The prevalence and extent of nontraumatic and trau-matic skin lesions on individual dolphins were assessed using photographs taken during 103 boat-based surveys completed between 2014 and 2016. A total of 15 primary skin lesion categories were identified from 126 humpback and 100 bottlenose dolphins. Differences in the prevalence of skin lesions were evident between age classes and spe-cies. Nontraumatic skin lesions were prevalent in 48.4% of the humpback and 61.0% of the bottle-nose dolphins. Comparatively, traumatic lesions were evident in almost all humpback (92.3%) and bottlenose (99.0%) dolphins. Anthropogenic-related injuries from entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes were substantial and signifi-cantly differed between species (p < 0.05). Injuries from fishing and vessel activities affected 11.0% of humpback dolphins and 30.0% of bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that these activities pose a major threat to these populations. Findings from this study provide an important baseline to inform ongoing health monitoring and conservation efforts of these vulnerable dolphin populations inhabiting a near-urban embayment. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activities have altered the structure and function of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, affecting the animals that occur in these areas. Predictive models are useful to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic characteristics over species distribution. In this study, we used generalized linear models to assess the influence Valo Grande canal, which allows fresh water to enter the Estuarine Lagunar Complex of Cananéia, has on the occurrence of Guiana dolphins. A population of this species resides in the study area, which comprises many coastal and marine protected areas. Abiotic data and information on species occurrence were gathered between January 2012 and November 2014, during three fieldworks per season, covering four sectors within the estuary. The predictions resulting from generalized linear models indicated that the discharge of fresh water, which decreases salinity in the estuary, has a negative influence on the populations of dolphins in all sectors but, mainly, on sector IV, the closest to Valo Grande Canal. Thus, it is clear that Guiana dolphins presented a heterogeneous distribution within the studied estuary, and the areas of higher concentration of individuals deserve greater attention during the elaboration of conservation strategies.

ABSTRACT: In Chinese and South-east Asian waters, the coastal and estuarine environments are important habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). Coastal and estuarine maritime engineering (CEME), including land reclamation, embankment or shoreline armouring, harbour construction and marine farming, permanently changes coastal environments and threatens the long-term persistence of marine biota and ecosystems. Such impacts on humpback dolphin viability, however, are rarely discussed. Likely core habitat of the humpback dolphin was extrapolated based on present understanding of habitat characteristics, which is much narrower than present data describing the species’ range. Some uninvestigated habitats near densely populated landscapes may be prone to intense CEME impacts. CEME impacts compromise humpback dolphin survival through habitat loss, population fragmentation, alteration of ecological regimes and deterioration of ecosystem functionality. A 30% loss of core habitat can catastrophically reduce the population viability of this species. The best strategy to avoid CEME impacts on humpback dolphin viability is to adopt a conservative planning regime from the outset. To inform habitat protection planning, current and past habitat configuration and habitat characteristics of the humpback dolphin can be clarified by systematically designed surveys, local ecological knowledge investigation, long-term satellite remote-sensing data and species distribution modelling exercises. Sound habitat protection planning includes mapping hierarchical marine protected area (MPA) networks using spatial planning algorithms and carefully examining CEME impacts from an ecosystem perspective. To prevent inappropriate CEME planning, the inclusion of citizen science, local community participation, marine environmental education and effective information delivery is proposed. Questions relating to the proposed areas of habitat loss, the extent of environmental change and the status of population–habitat viability under the scenario of CEME impacts are proposed in order to examine and re-examine the environmental impacts of any CEME project. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We report the first case of conspecific calf-directed aggression in Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) as a possible infanticide attempt in Mutsu Bay, Japan. Our observation of a 75-minute-long persistent attack on a neonate was performed by 10 attackers (4 adult males, 1 possible male, and 5 of unknown sex) and left the neonate with visible injuries. Only one individual was recorded for the entirety of the event and was regarded as the possible mother, displaying protective behaviours towards the neonate as well as being the target of coercive guarding and sexual behaviours, such as mounting, by the attackers. The observation featured a distinct group composition change in which, after 50 minutes, the attack was taken over by a new group of attackers. There was a brief overlap between the groups in which some dolphins from the first group surfaced with the second. Excluding the mother and calf, only two individuals that were observed towards the end of the first group attack remained with the second group until the end of the observation. The first group of attackers did not make further aggressive attempts on the neo-nate or presumed mother, and no conflict between the two groups was witnessed. The second group continued the attack with significantly increased aggression and a greater array of behavioural types than the first, often dividing into two approximately 5-to 10-m distanced subgroups— one that herded the suspected mother and another that focused on attacking the neonate. Our study analysed the frequency and variety of behavioural types used in the attack and compared them between individuals and the two separate attack groups. The group change we observed is absent from the literature on conspecific calf-directed attacks in other cetacean species and, if this is an infanticide attempt, provides new insight into the social structure of Pacific white-sided dolphins. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Allocare—alloparenting or allomaternal care—has been documented for both sexes in terres-trial, aquatic, and avian species (for a review, see Riedman, 1982), and may be linked to the evo-lution of an increased brain size in some social mammals (Isler & van Schaik, 2012). The ben-efits afforded through an allocare strategy enable mothers to travel and forage unencumbered, mini-mize energy expenditure, and increase energy intake, thereby allowing these species to invest more heavily or efficiently in offspring than mothers who exclusively care for their offspring (Burkart et al., 2009; Isler & van Schaik, 2012). Allocare occurs when supportive care is provided for conspecific young by individuals other than the genetic parents (i.e., siblings, aunts, uncles, or unrelated individuals identified as “helpers”). These helper individuals behave in a way that benefits a young animal (Wilson, 1975; Riedman, 1982; Whitehead, 1996; Gero et al., 2009; Schubert et al., 2009; Stanton & Mann, 2012), but their action(s) may also have advantages to the alloparent (Whitehead, 1996; Lewis & Pusey, 1997; Mann & Smuts, 1998; Roulin, 2002; Gero et al., 2009; Isler & van Schaik, 2012). © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Epimeletic behavior toward dead calves has been frequently reported in cetaceans, mostly with females (presumed mothers) showing supportive behaviors such as carrying, lifting, or sinking, often assisted by “escort” individuals. However, information on acoustic production in such contexts is scarce. This report describes two observations of epimeletic behavior toward dead newborns in bottlenose dolphins and associated acoustic production. Data were collected at the Tiber River estuary (Rome, Mediterranean Sea, Italy) with one hydrophone for passive acoustic monitoring and two digital cameras. In both cases, an individual (presumed mother) acting as the main supporter and directly interacting with the carcass by lifting it (case 1) or sinking it (case 2) was observed. Another adult individual (escort) was present in both encounters showing standing-by and excitement behaviors (case 1) and supportive behavior (case 2). In both encounters, whistles, pulsed sounds, and bray-call elements were recorded. The consistent vocal activity observed likely conveyed context-specific information. A signature whistle in the first encounter was also recorded, likely emitted by the putative mother as a distress call. This report confirms the occurrence of epimeletic behavior in bottlenose dolphins and reports a preliminary description of the acoustic production when a dead calf is involved, providing additional information on this largely unknown topic. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were measured in blubber samples collected from 196 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from 2000 to 2016 in the Sarasota Bay, Florida, ecosystem. Legacy POPs included polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (ΣPCB; sum of 37 congeners or congener groups), dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and transformation products (ΣDDT), chlordane and related compounds (ΣChlor), mirex, polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (ΣPBDE, sum of five congeners), dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). All POP compounds or compound groups declined in dolphin blubber over the study period. POP classes declined at different rates within classifications (sex, adult or calf). For example, dieldrin decline in male dolphins was greatest (−13% per year) while HCB decline was lower (−6.3% per year). For individual POP classes, rates of decline depended on classification. For example, ΣPCB, the POP class present at the highest concentration relative to other POPs, declined at −8.4, −7.8, and −5.6% per year in adult females, adult males and calves, respectively. Overall POP declines were highest in adult males and lowest in calves. Declines in POP concentration with time based on individual dolphins resampled at different time points were consistent with declines calculated based on yearly or biennial cross-sections taken from 2000 through 2016. Overall rates of decline in Sarasota Bay bottlenose dolphins were like declines seen for Great Lakes fish and about twice the rate of decline observed in arctic temporal trend data sets. POP trends appear to have leveled off since 2009 in Sarasota Bay dolphins. For example, ΣPCBs in calves appear to have stabilized at 21 mg/kg lipid. Recent published work on delphinids with blubber concentrations spanning those observed in the present work suggest that levels of legacy POPs currently observed in Sarasota dolphins may suppress population growth. Results from this study confirm the need for continued monitoring of POPs in the Sarasota Bay bottlenose dolphin population to see if concentrations are continuing to fall or have indeed plateaued.

ABSTRACT: Stranding records regarding the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) were collected from the Italian Stranding Network database (CIBRA), online open sources databases and scientific literature in a period ranging from 1983 to 2021. Recordings were classified into Mediterranean geographic areas according to the International Hydrographic Organization. A total of 1500 stranded individuals of striped dolphin were considered in the analysis. The striped dolphin showed the highest median length of 188 cm (IR=38.5, n=95) in the Adriatic Sea. The highest value of median weight was recorded in the Western Mediterranean Sea, with a value of 70 kg. Considering the consumption rates, average IB values were 2.3 kg/day (±0.8) in the Tyrrhenian Sea, 2.2 kg/day (±0.8) in the Ionian Sea, 2.1 kg/day (±0.8) in the Western Mediterranean Sea and 2.8 kg/day (±0.9) considering all Mediterranean basin. These results represent a baseline for further studies aimed at understanding the population structure, mortality patterns and the effects of anthropogenic pressures on the survival of this species locally and in the Mediterranean Sea.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: On 3 January 2021, an apparently healthy adult female Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea), accompanied by her seemingly thriving nursing calf, was observed in the Eilat Marina in the Gulf of Aqaba, Israel (Figure 1a-c). The adult female was named “Ella,” and on 14 January 2021, following a southern gale, Ella was sighted alone and was assumed to have lost her calf. Since then and until her last sighting on 14 June 2022, she had been sighted during daytime hours almost daily in sandy shallow coastal waters along a 2.1-km narrow strip from Eilat Marina to Eilat North Beach lagoon and to Aqaba Marina, Jordan, with most of her observations in the Eilat Lagoon (Figure 2b). She had not been documented in the vicinity of coral patches in Eilat or in Aqaba. She had also never been documented associating with local Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) or with the three free-ranging Black Sea common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus ponticus), residents of Eilat Dolphin Reef, which regularly frequented the same area. Ella was also clear of scars and tooth rakes that might have indicated unobserved interspecific contact. © 2022, Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Underwater noise from human activities is recognized as a world-wide problem, with important repercussions on the acoustic communication of aquatic mammals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Panama went into a nationwide lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. This lockdown resulted in the closing of tourism infrastructure and limited mobility in both land and coastal areas. We used this “natural experiment” as an opportunity to study the impact of tour-boat activities on dolphin communication by using passive acoustic monitoring data collected before and during the lockdown at Dolphin Bay, Bocas del Toro, Panama. During the lockdown, tour-boat activity was absent, but boats transporting people and supplies were allowed to circulate. The shift in type of boat activity within the lockdown resulted in lower ambient noise levels and more frequent detections of dolphin sounds. We also detected a more diverse whistle repertoire during the lockdown than in the pre-lockdown period, even when accounting for variation in sample coverage. A Random Forest Analysis classified whistles between the two periods with high accuracy (92.4% accuracy, κ = 0.85) based primarily on whistle modulation and duration. During the lockdown, whistles were longer in duration and less modulated than pre-lockdown. Our study shows that a shift in boat traffic activity can generate significant changes in dolphin habitat, and in their communicative signals, an important consideration given ongoing unregulated ecotourism in the region.

ABSTRACT: Coastal aquaculture activities overlap with the habitats of various marine predators such as sea birds, seals, and dolphins (Schreiber et al., 2002; Kemper et al., 2003; Bearzi et al., 2009). In such areas, predatory species have been reported to interact with the aquaculture systems regularly (Methion & Lopez, 2019). Such interactions seem to be associated with food resource availability. The establishment of aquaculture systems leads to the aggregation of wild fish, primarily because of the large quantities of unconsumed food originating from the facilities (Tuya et al., 2006; Fernandez-Jover et al., 2007). Consequently, considerable amounts of organic matter with high nitrogen and phosphate contents are found at the dumping sights which, in turn, attract prey species (Karakassis et al., 2000; Wursig & Gailey, 2002; Kemper et al., 2003). © 2022, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: This study represents the first complete assessment of the population dynamics and residency of common bottlenose dolphins in the Western Ligurian Sea, an area where bottlenose dolphin sightings have been rare in the past. Despite being greatly affected by human pressure, information about this population is poor and sporadic. The study took place from April 2018 to December 2020. One hundred and seventy-one dedicated boat surveys were performed year-round resulting in 95 sightings, and 123 individuals were identified through mark-recapture photo-identification techniques. Dolphins were found to be present year-round. Most of the animals (79) used the area sporadically and only 19.5% of the dolphins (24) were seen regularly. Bottlenose dolphin abundance was estimated at 248 using open POPAN population models (CI 95% = 217-284). These results help fill a knowledge gap by highlighting the regular presence of bottlenose dolphins in the study area. Moreover, they represent a baseline for future studies investigating abundance trends and the conservation status of this population. © 2022 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Human noise can be harmful to sound-centric marine mammals. Significant research has focused on characterizing behavioral responses of protected cetacean species to navy mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS). Controlled exposure experiments (CEE) using animal-borne tags have proved valuable, but smaller dolphins are not amenable to tagging and groups of interacting individuals are more relevant behavioral units for these social species. To fill key data gaps on group responses of social delphinids that are exposed to navy MFAS in large numbers, we describe novel approaches for the coordinated collection and integrated analysis of multiple remotely-sensed datasets during CEEs. This involves real-time coordination of a sonar source, shore-based group tracking, aerial photogrammetry to measure fine-scale movements and passive acoustics to quantify vocal activity. Using an example CEE involving long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis bairdii), we demonstrate how resultant quantitative metrics can be used to estimate behavioral changes and noise exposure-response relationships. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) technique has been widely used to detect odontocetes that emit echolocation clicks. However, identifying sympatric dolphins and porpoises using clicks, which is important especially for conservation purposes, remains challenging. In this study, a species identification technique at the family group level using PAM was applied to classify the click trains of two sympatric odontocetes, the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides, N.p.) and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis, S.c.). A threshold was identified to discriminate between the two species using the two-band intensity ratios at 130 and 70 kHz. In addition to the significant difference in the two-band intensity ratio, analyses of the click train characteristics revealed that the click train duration and inter-click interval were significantly longer for S.c. than for N.p., indicating that these parameters enable more accurate species identification. Although this study provides a clear means of discriminating between the two species to reveal their distributions and habitat usage, additional studies are recommended to determine whether the same method can be employed to discriminate between other species known to have overlapping distributions in the region, such as Tursiops aduncus or Orcaella brevirostris. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Mammalian integument coloration mainly depends on the amount and type of melanin which is regu-lated by the enzyme tyrosinase. The dark coloration of cetaceans is mainly a result of the presence of melanocytes (Behrmann, 1998). Melanocytes pro-duce melanin, which is stored in the dorsal part of the skin of cetaceans, while white body parts (e.g., the ventrum) do not contain melanin due to anoma-lies in the tyrosinase (Behrmann, 1998). If tyrosi-nase is defective, pigmentation patterns can differ markedly from the typical colorations of a given species (Fertl & Rosel, 2009). Approximately 100 possible mutations in the tyrosinase gene can cause a phenotypic anomaly called hypopigmentation that can manifest in different ways (Oetting et al., 2009). © 2022,Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The exchange of prosocial behaviors such as grooming may be affected by several factors, including the social structure and social relationships of the individuals. However, studies on the reciprocity of prosocial affiliative behaviors in non-primate animals are limited. Flipper rubbing is considered a prosocial affiliative behavior in dolphins. We investigated the reciprocity of flipper rubbing and tested the following hypotheses in common bottlenose dolphins: trade for tolerance, trade for a reduction in renewed aggressions, the value of flipper rubbing partner, and reciprocity over short and long time frames. There was no correlation between the frequency of flipper rubbing and aggression. Age difference did not affect reciprocal flipper rubbing. Flipper rubbing by former opponents did not increase after aggression. Dolphins did not provide flipper rubbing immediately after receiving flipper rubbing. The exchange of flipper rubbing was more reciprocal over long time frames than over short time frames. Dolphins preferentially rubbed the individuals who rubbed them the most. Pairs who performed flipper rubbing more frequently partook in more reciprocal flipper rubbing than pairs who performed flipper rubbing less frequently. Results suggest that bottlenose dolphins maintain flipper rubbing reciprocity over the long-term via partner choice based on an emotional bookkeeping system. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Ethological Society.

ABSTRACT: An exhaustive review of anecdotal references related to dolphin-fishery information in the Greek seas during the early phase of fishery development (1900-1975) was conducted. In that period fishers perceived dolphins as competitors and would intentionally kill them in retaliation for the loss that the dolphins caused by obstructing fishing operations and damaging fishing gear. This review highlights that dolphin-fishery interaction has been a major cause of concern to Greek fishers since the early 20th century, escalating with the way of life of modern society. © 2022, Historical Society of Southern Primorska of Koper.

ABSTRACT: The detrimental effects of contaminant exposure and changes in the availability of food resources are still of concern for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Here, we validated and applied a blubber cortisol biomarker approach to assess the physiological responses of PRE dolphins to various pollutants and diet changes during 2008–2018 (n = 70). For calves, generalized additive models (GAMs) revealed that cortisol levels varied significantly by month and were positively correlated with the body length, owing to significant maternal transfer of hormones. The significantly positive correlation between length-adjusted cortisol levels in calf and the annual calf mortality ratios suggested that during years of high calf mortality, these animals were highly stressed before they die. For noncalves, blubber cortisol levels in diseased animals were significantly higher than those in “healthy” ones. Chromium (Cr) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes displayed a significant and positive relationship with blubber cortisol levels, suggesting that contaminant-mediated endocrine disruption effects may have occurred in noncalves. The GAMs indicated a decreasing trend of noncalf’s blubber cortisol levels over an 11-year span, which can be explained by their declining contaminant accumulation levels due to a significant dietary shift from eating highly contaminated fishes to less polluted ones. © 2021 American Chemical Society

ABSTRACT: Osseous lesions, such as age-related degenerative changes, chronic joint infections, and old traumatic injuries, have long been recognized in the wild (Fox, 1939). Among terrestrial mammals, they have been reported mainly in large ungulates such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginia-nus) and moose (Alces alces) (Wobeser & Runge, 1975; Peterson, 1988). Notwithstanding major differences in type of locomotion and in weight bearing compared to terrestrial mammals, osseous lesions have also been described in several species of odontocetes and, less often, in mysticetes (Kompanje, 1999). Causes proposed to explain these lesions have included, among others, low genetic diversity, infection, traumatic injury, age-related degeneration, environmental pollution, and dysbaric stress (Kompanje, 1999; Moore & Early, 2004; Groch et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2020). These lesions are often identified in the chronic stage or in decomposed animals by which time the original insult is no longer obvious, leaving only the morphological appearance and distribution of lesions to help determine their origin. Because life history, feeding strategy, and preferred habitat can differ greatly among cetaceans, observations of osseous lesions in animals of different species may provide further clues to their potential origins. Herein, we report anomalies in the axial skeleton of a Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), a species of odontocete that occurs in temperate and tropical seas worldwide. The sole member of its genus, the species typically inhabits upper continental slope waters of 200 to 1,000 m depth where it feeds mainly on deep-water cephalopods (Hartman, 2018). © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Intoxications of captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Florida Keys have been linked to observed interactions with marine macrophytic algal and cyanobacterial communities within enclosures. Taxonomic characterization of these communities coupled, in turn, to available observational data collected during intoxication events point to a contribution of filamentous cyanobacterial assemblages comprised of members of the polyphyletic genus, Lyngbya sensu lato. To identify toxic metabolites possibly relevant to these intoxications, chemical screening for known neurotoxins from cyanobacteria, as well as other regionally relevant harmful algal bloom (HAB) taxa, was combined with toxicity testing, and subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation, employing early life stages (i.e., embryos and larvae) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a well-established aquatic vertebrate toxicological model. Chemical analyses did not detect (within analytical limits) any of the known algal or cyanobacterial neurotoxins. Toxicity testing, alongside bioassay-guided fractionation, however, identified several chemical fractions with a range of potentially relevant bioactivities in both zebrafish embryos and post-hatch larvae including, in particular, behavioral (e.g., aberrant swimming) and physiological (e.g., altered heart rate) endpoints indicative of possible neurotoxicity, and subsequent chemical characterization of fractions suggested a contribution of the previously identified bioactive metabolite, eudesmacarbonate, in the observed toxicity. Comparative toxicological assessment with PbTx-2, as a positive control for neurotoxicity in the zebrafish model, further supported neurotoxic activity of cyanobacterial metabolites potentially relevant, in turn, to a contribution of these metabolites to dolphin intoxications. These findings suggest, in general, that marine zoological facilities may be affected by regional HABs, and assessments of potentially toxigenic algae and cyanobacteria should be included in management strategies in these facilities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Indus River dolphin (IRD; Platanista gangetica minor) is an endangered and blind freshwater cetacean, endemic to the Indus River system of Pakistan and India. This review article provides detailed information about the major challenges IRDs are facing, and their possible consequences on the population dynamics of the IRD. Furthermore, we have suggested future conservation strategies for the IRD based on the lesson learned from the conservation of the Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), a Critically Endangered freshwater cetacean. The major challenges for IRDs are habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, and several types of industrial and agricultural pollutants. Worsening climatic changes, illegal fishing, and overfishing are additional threats. The construction of several barrages has fragmented the population into several short segments, some of which are too small for the IRDs to survive. In some segments, the population status of the IRD is unknown. In the remaining populations, genetic inbreeding, water shortage, canal entrapment, and altered ecological environment are potent negative factors for the survival of the IRD. Conservation strategies including fishing bans, translocation, and future research (tagging, periodic health assessments, necropsy and virtopsy, understanding the reproductive biology, and genomics) are possible recommendations. Very serious conservation efforts are needed to save the IRD from decline keeping in view the water shortage, pollution, lack of health assessment studies, and habitat degradation and fragmentation. © Copyright © 2021 Nabi, Ahmad, McLaughlin, Hao, Khan, Ahmad, Ahmad, Kiani, Wu and Li.

ABSTRACT: The development of a precise blood or skin tissue DNA Epigenetic Aging Clock for Odontocete (OEAC) would solve current age estimation inaccuracies for wild odontocetes. Therefore, we determined genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using a custom array (HorvathMammalMethyl40) across skin and blood samples (n = 446) from known age animals representing nine odontocete species within 4 phylogenetic families to identify age associated CG dinucleotides (CpGs). The top CpGs were used to create a cross-validated OEAC clock which was highly correlated for individuals (r = 0.94) and for unique species (median r = 0.93). Finally, we applied the OEAC for estimating the age and sex of 22 wild Norwegian killer whales. DNA methylation patterns of age associated CpGs are highly conserved across odontocetes. These similarities allowed us to develop an odontocete epigenetic aging clock (OEAC) which can be used for species conservation efforts by provide a mechanism for estimating the age of free ranging odontocetes from either blood or skin samples. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, can suffer health complications from prolonged freshwater exposure; however, little is known about how dolphins behaviorally respond to flood events. We investigated whether dolphins mitigated their freshwater exposure by moving south towards the estuary mouth and/or towards deeper areas with higher salinities in response to a record-breaking flood in Pensacola Bay, Florida. In total, 144 dolphin groups observed during 45 population dynamic surveys were analyzed across two flood-impacted sampling sessions and their respective seasonal control sessions. Kernel density estimates demonstrated southern movement towards the estuary mouth during flood-impacted sessions, but this distribution change was limited. Species distribution models showed that dolphins did not move to deeper areas after the flood and dolphin distribution was not substantially altered by flood-induced salinity changes. The estuary system exhibits strongly stratified waters with broad salinity ranges even during the flood. Dolphins may have mitigated the severity of freshwater exposure by capitalizing on these stratified areas as they continued to use habitat affected by the flood. A lack of avoidance of low salinity could result in this dolphin population being at greater risk for health problems, which should be considered in future population management and conservation. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: As IUCN critically vulnerable species,the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) have attracted great public attention in recent years. The threats of human disturbance and environmental pollution to this population have been documented extensively. However, research on the sensitivity of this species to climate change is lacking. To understand the effect of climate change on the potential distribution of Sousa chinensis, we developed a weighted ensemble model based on 82 occurrence records and six predictor variables (e.g., ocean depth, distance to shore, mean temperature, salinity, ice thickness, and current velocity). According to the true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), our ensemble model presented higher prediction precision than most of the single-algorithm models. It also indicated that ocean depth and distance to shore were the most important predictors in shaping the distribution patterns. The projections for the 2050s and 2100s from our ensemble model indicated a severe adverse impact of climate change on the Sousa chinensis habitat. Over 75% and 80% of the suitable habitat in the present day will be lost in all representative concentration pathway emission scenarios (RCPS) in the 2050s and 2100s, respectively. With the increased numbers of records of stranding and deaths of Sousa chinensis in recent years, strict management regulations and conservation plans are urgent to safeguard the current suitable habitats. Due to habitat contraction and poleward shift in the future, adaptive management strategies, including designing new reserves and adjusting the location and range of reserves according to the geographical distribution of Sousa chinensis, should be formulated to minimize the impacts of climate change on this species. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

ABSTRACT: Some moral behaviours, often regarded as reflecting high cognitive abilities (such as empathy, cooperation, targeted helping) are known to only be present in very few species, like great apes, elephants and cetaceans. Prosocial behaviours (producing a benefit for the recipient without necessarily involving a cost for the actor) have been mostly found in primates and, more recently, in elephants. Despite dolphins’ reputation for helping their conspecifics, experimental studies about their prosocial and empathic abilities are rare. We conducted Prosocial Choice Tests in six bottlenose dolphins. The subjects had to choose between three objects: choosing the prosocial object induced the simultaneous rewarding of both the subject and a recipient individual; choosing the selfish object induced a reward only for the subject; choosing the null one did not reward anyone. We found prosociality and direct reciprocity in our subjects, and our results suggested that bottlenose dolphins might be able to modulate their prosocial and reciprocal tendencies according to partner-specific information. Subjects seemed to be more prosocial towards the other sex and more reciprocal towards same-sex recipients. This reciprocity might be underpinned by the same features that rule their behaviours in the wild (cooperating with same sex conspecifics). Moreover, an audience effect was reported, as the presence of the subject’s young increased subjects’ likelihood of prosocial response. Our findings highlighted that prosociality could appear in taxa other than primates, suggesting a convergent evolutionary phenomenon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Dam constructions threaten aquatic fauna, degrading their habitats and causing population fragmentation. Environmental impact studies were carried out from March 2010 to July 2015 as part of the licensing process concerning the Jirau Hydroelectric Dam construction, located on the Madeira River, Rondônia, Brazil, aiming to assess its impacts on the local fauna. The dam closed its gates in December 2012 and the water level rose from 2013 to 2015, creating a 468 km2 reservoir. Dams may be a source of negative effects to several species, including the Bolivian river dolphin, Inia boliviensis, which have a restricted distribution in northern Bolivian rivers and part of the Madeira River Basin. This study evaluated the presence of I. boliviensis in different sections of the Madeira River before reservoir filling (BRF) and after reservoir filling (ARF) through a quantitative analysis. Dolphins were actively searched along linear transects in four sections of the river: Abunã, Mutum, Caiçara and Canteiro, over 125 km (250 km round trip). A total effort of 986 h was carried out along 210 days during the hydrological seasons (falling, low, rising and high-water level). Twenty-nine (29) groups were recorded BRF in the direct dam influence area (N = 62), while thirty-eight (38) groups were documented ARF (N = 111). The highest number of sightings was recorded in Abunã during both periods: 24 in BRF (N = 50) and 33 in ARF (N = 101). The greatest number of dolphins was detected during the falling and low hydrological seasons: 19 in BRF (N = 48) and 30 in ARF (N = 92). This is expected, since decreasing water levels lead to a higher concentration of prey and, consequently, higher numbers of dolphins can be observed. Standardized methodology and experienced staff are essential to ensure adequate dolphin population estimates, especially in these critical habitats, where the main impacts caused by the dam are population fragmentation, isolation and extirpation, and reproductive segregation. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Diphyllobothriosis caused by the Pacific broad tapeworm Adenocephalus pacificus (syn. Diphyllobothrium pacificum) is an emerging parasitic disease reported also from non-endemic areas, including Europe (Spain). The origin of these human cases is unknown but should be related to fresh marine fish imported from endemic areas. In this study, we molecularly confirmed common dolphins Delphinus delphis off Argentina as euparatenic transit hosts of A. pacificus. Preliminary analysis of their stomach content, together with data from previous studies from the Southwest Atlantic, showed that common dolphins feed almost exclusively on schooling Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi and Argentine anchovy Engraulis anchoita. Therefore, we suggest that Argentine hake and Argentine anchovy may represent the intermediate hosts of A. pacificus in the Southwest Atlantic, but also in Europe to where M. hubbsi is imported on ice (unfrozen). © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

ABSTRACT: The common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) is one of the most common cetaceans in Venezuela. This study aims to describe habitat use in the Mochima National Park, a protected area under high anthropogenic pressure. Opportunistic surveys were conducted following a pre-defined route from September 2009 to August 2010. Data such as the geographical position, group size, composition, behaviour were recorded at 5min intervals. A focal group-follow methodology was used. A grid of 500 × 500m was constructed and each cell was characterised by environmental features and a Coefficient of Area Use (CAU) was calculated. A logistic regression model was applied to identify factors that explain use pattern. Seventy opportunistic surveys were conducted during which 86 groups of dolphins were observed. Dolphins occupied an area of 36km2, but Tigrillo inlet and to the northeast of the Caracas Islands were the areas most used. The common dolphins exhibited differential use, using shallow inshore waters most intensively and with probability of occurrence decreasing with increasing water depth and distance to the coast. They spent most of their time in feeding (40%) and socialising (24%) activities. Feeding and travelling behaviours were observed throughout the area studied, whereas socialising and resting activities were mainly concentrated in Tigrillo inlet, the Manare peninsula and the Caracas islands. Behaviour was mostly determined by season, depth, distance to the coast, group size and group composition. Throughout the year, the Park provided areas for refuge, feeding, and resting. It is therefore imperative to promote management and conservation policies that prevent any negative impacts from the increasing tourism and fishing activities we observed. © 2021 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Population models, such as those used for Population Viability Analysis (PVA), are valuable for projecting trends, assessing threats, guiding environmental resource management, and planning species conservation measures. However, rarely are the needed data on all aspects of the life history available for cetacean species, because they are long-lived and difficult to study in their aquatic habitats. We present a detailed assessment of population dynamics for the long-term resident Sarasota Bay common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community. Model parameters were estimated from 27 years of nearly complete monitoring, allowing calculation of age-specific and sex-specific mortality and reproductive rates, uncertainty in parameter values, fluctuation in demographic rates over time, and intrinsic uncertainty in the population trajectory resulting from stochastic processes. Using the Vortex PVA model, we projected mean population growth and quantified causes of variation and uncertainty in growth. The ability of the model to simulate the dynamics of the population was confirmed by comparing model projections to observed census trends from 1993 to 2020. When the simulation treated all losses as deaths and included observed immigration, the model projects a long-term mean annual population growth of 2.1%. Variance in annual growth across years of the simulation (SD = 3.1%) was due more to environmental variation and intrinsic demographic stochasticity than to uncertainty in estimates of mean demographic rates. Population growth was most sensitive to uncertainty and annual variation in reproduction of peak breeding age females and in calf and juvenile mortality, while adult survival varied little over time. We examined potential threats to the population, including increased anthropogenic mortality and impacts of red tides, and tested resilience to catastrophic events. Due to its life history characteristics, the population was projected to be demographically stable at smaller sizes than commonly assumed for Minimum Viable Population of mammals, but it is expected to recover only slowly from any catastrophic events, such as disease outbreaks and spills of oil or other toxins. The analyses indicate that well-studied populations of small cetaceans might typically experience slower growth rates (about 2%) than has been assumed in calculations of Potential Biological Removal used by management agencies to determine limits to incidental take of marine mammals. The loss of an additional one dolphin per year was found to cause significant harm to this population of about 150 to 175 animals. Beyond the significance for the specific population, demographic analyses of the Sarasota Bay dolphins provide a template for examining viability of other populations of small cetaceans.

ABSTRACT: We report on the emergence of the epibiotic barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis in Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in September 2018, six months after a lethal morbillivirus epidemic. Small boat surveys were conducted at the entrance and in the interior of the bay from January 2018 to February 2021. Dolphins were photo-identified and classified according to overall spatial use of the Bay. We examined the potential influence of the period and habitat on the prevalence of X. globicipitis. The overall prevalence of the barnacle was 38.7% in 214 dolphins. X. globicipitis was not observed in 99 individually identified dolphins from January to August 2018 (first period) but was seen on 83 of the 194 (42.8%) dolphins photographed from September 2018 to February 2021 (second period). Moreover, in 22 individuals repeatedly photographed during both periods, prevalence was 0% and 91% during the first and second period, respectively. Prevalence was the highest in the dolphins using the entrance of the Bay (55.0%, N = 140), intermediate in animals using equally both the entrance and interior area (42.9%, N = 47), and the lowest (6.4%, N = 7) in those using the interior area only. The calves of five females infested with X. globicipitis were free of barnacles. Based on repeated photographs of barnacles at different growth stage on six dolphins, the periods between first and last sight with the epibiont were (in increasing order) 29, 32, 40, 51, 68 and 78 days. A conservative estimation from the initial settlement to sexual maturity was around 40–45 days. Three individuals of X. globicipitis collected on a stranded dolphin measured 65 mm, 61 mm and 35 mm, the largest recorded size to date. The two large individuals had incubated embryos while the smaller one presented developing gonads. Poor health and an impaired immune response in the dolphins that had survived the morbillivirus epidemic may have favored the introduction of the barnacle, but biotic and abiotic factors could also had played an important role. This paper documents the colonization of an estuarine area by X. globicipitis following ecological changes. © Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Hawaiian spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) rest during the day in the islands’ coastal waters where they are susceptible to human disturbance. Due to concerns over the negative impacts of human activity, the Pacific Islands Regional Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has proposed a 50-yard approach rule for spinner dolphins and is also considering time-area closures of certain important spinner dolphin resting areas. However, gaps still persist in the understanding of how spinner dolphin populations on different Hawaiian Islands use coastal waters, raising questions about the efficacy of the proposed rules. To better understand how spinner dolphins use the waters in the Maui Nui region (Maui, Moloka‘i, Lāna‘i, and the ‘Au‘au channel), a study was conducted using a combination of passive acoustic monitoring and vessel surveys to document spinner dolphin occurrence and movements. Bottom-moored acoustic recorders were deployed at eight locations in Maui Nui, and at one previously established resting bay off west O‘ahu for comparison. The amount of whistles, clicks, and burst pulses at each location was quantified and averaged by the hour of the day. Acoustic activity was greater at the O‘ahu site than at any of the Maui Nui sites, and was greatest between sunrise and noon. Acoustic activity and vessel surveys both reveal that spinner dolphins occur and exhibit resting behaviors in the ‘Au‘au channel between Maui and Lāna‘i, and also along west Maui and southeast Lāna‘i. Spinner dolphins resting in a channel between islands appears to be unique to Maui Nui and differs from resting patterns described along Hawai‘i Island and O‘ahu. Because spinner dolphins appear to use both the coastlines and the channel to rest in Maui Nui, the 50-yard approach rule appears to be a more suitable management option for the region than time-area closures. © Copyright © 2021 McElligott and Lammers.

ABSTRACT: Multispecies aggregations of tuna, dolphins, and seabirds are prevalent and conspicuous in the vast waters of the eastern tropical Pacific and form the basis of a commercial fishery for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) through setting on schools of dolphins, which is among the largest tuna fisheries in the world. Incidental dolphin mortality associated with the development and early years of the fishery was high; by 1993 it was estimated that eastern spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris orientalis) had been reduced to 44% and northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (S. attenuata attenuata) to 19% of pre-fishery levels. Efforts to reduce this mortality began at the inception of the fishery and comprised a diverse array of approaches: modifications to fishing methods and fishing gear (backdown, Medina panel, high-intensity floodlights, swimmers to disentangle and release dolphins); U.S. legislation (through the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, MMPA, and subsequent amendments); international agreements (including the International Dolphin Conservation Program that established dolphin mortality limits, and the legally binding multilateral Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program); and economic incentives [notably through establishment of the U.S. dolphin-safe label and positive certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)]. Together, these bycatch mitigation efforts have been remarkably successful; dolphin mortality due to entanglement as recorded by fisheries observers (hereafter, entanglement mortality) has been reduced by > 99%. Despite this, the degree to which dolphin populations have recovered remains unclear. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that individual dolphins experience multiple sets in their lifetimes and although causality has not been established, research suggests that chase and encirclement might have impacts on dolphins in addition to entanglement mortality. These impacts potentially include increased fetal and/or calf mortality, separation of nursing females and their calves, decreased fecundity, increased predation, disruption of mating and other social systems, and ecological disruption. The strong management emphasis on monitoring entanglement mortality, and the infrastructure necessary to support this monitoring (in particular, 100% observer coverage on large purse-seiners) require funding to the extent that other activities, particularly continued surveys to monitor stock status and clarify the potential influence of other effects of the fishery on dolphin populations, are currently inadequately funded.

ABSTRACT: A 6-year-old female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) kept in dolphinarium died after a 3.5-month period of lethargy and inappetence despite antibiotics and supportive care. At necropsy, gross findings included diffuse varying-sized nodules in the lungs and scattered nodules throughout the heart, spleen, mesenteric and hilar lymph node and kidney. Microscopically, the lesions were characterised by disseminated fungal pyogranulomas with numerous intralesional Mucor-like fungi. The fungi structures were demonstrated by Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomori methenamine silver stain. Molecular analyses of the fungi were Rhizopus microsporus by PCR sequencing 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Ziehl–Neelsen stain failed to show acid-fast bacterial infection. Based on pathological and molecular examination, systemic granulomatous mucormycosis was diagnosed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of systemic mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus microsporus in bottlenose dolphin. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The dolphins Inia geoffrensis—boto and Sotalia fluviatilis—tucuxi are threatened cetaceans in-habiting river ecosystems in South America; population numbers are still lacking for many areas. This paper provides density and abundance estimations of boto and tucuxi in 15 rivers sampled during the past nine years as part of a multinational research alliance. Visual boat-survey data collection protocols and analyses have been developed since 2012 (based on Distance Sampling methods) and recently reviewed (2019) to improve robustness and comparability. Differences across the sampled rivers and the analyzed river basins (Amazon and Orinoco) pointed to a density/population size gradient with lower densities and abundances observed in the Orinoco basin (0.9–1.5 ind./km²), passing through the eastern Amazon basin (2–5 ind./km²), and the largest numbers found at the central Brazilian Amazon (lower Purus River—2012 (14.5 boto/km², N = 7672; 17.1 tucuxi/km², N = 9238)). However, in other parts of the central Amazon, the density of dolphins was smaller than expected for high productive whitewater rivers (1–1.7 ind./km² in the Japurá and Solimões rivers). We attributed these differences to specific features of the basin (e.g., hydro-geomorphology) as well as to the cumulative effects of anthropogenic activities. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The few hormone studies on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) pregnancy with different reproductive outcomes, e.g., normal birth, stillbirth and abortion, have mostly focused on progestagens or relaxin. However, recent analysis of androgens, glucocorticoids and estrogens has shown they are also biomarkers of cetacean pregnancy. Therefore, our objective was to examine circulating concentrations of androgens, glucocorticoids and estrogens during bottlenose dolphin pregnancies with different reproductive outcomes, including normal pregnancy (NORM, n = 27), failure to thrive (FTT, n = 17), perinatal loss (PNL, n = 20), early loss (EL, n = 12) and false pregnancy (FP, n = 16), to determine if they could be potential indicators of reproductive or fetal health. We analyzed longitudinal serum samples (n = 654) from 57 bottlenose dolphins and 92 reproductive events for testosterone, androstenedione, cortisol, estradiol and estrone conjugates. Testosterone concentrations were higher during EL compared to NORM and lower during FP at MID (day 121 – 240 post ovulation/conception) and LATE (day 241 – end of FP) stages (months post conception/ovulation [MPC, MPO] seven through ten, P < 0.05). During FTT, androstenedione concentrations were increased compared to NORM pregnancies in the EARLY and LATE stages (P ≤ 0.05), and concentrations were reduced during FP (P < 0.05). For cortisol, FTT pregnancies had higher concentrations compared to NORM during all stages (P < 0.05), while PNL had higher cortisol during EARLY and LATE stages (P < 0.05). Estradiol concentrations were lower for EL and FP compared to NORM (P < 0.05), while estrone conjugates were only reduced during FP (P < 0.05). Based on our results only cortisol may be a useful predictor of PNL, while both cortisol and androstenedione were useful for distinguishing FTT pregnancies. Similarly, both testosterone and estradiol during EL and FP were different from NORM. Our data indicate a suite of pregnancy specific hormone biomarkers to evaluate maternal and fetal health in bottlenose dolphins should include cortisol, androgens and estrogens. This research also highlights the importance on non-progestagen hormones as sentinels of cetacean pregnancy and fetal health. Copyright © 2021 Steinman, Montano and Robeck.

ABSTRACT: Marine wildlife tourism has rapidly developed in Reunion Island, due to a large demand for interactions with a resident population of spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris). The presence of dolphin-watching vessels close to dolphin groups can cause short-term impacts on their behaviour; cumulative incidences likely result in deleterious long-term impacts on the population. Using scan sampling, we collected behavioural data on spinner dolphins to evaluate the short-term effects of dolphin watching on their behaviour. The dolphins were less likely to begin socialising or diving while travelling and more likely to stay travelling and milling in the presence of vessels. Additionally, activity budgets for resting and socialising decreased simultaneously with increased travelling and milling. Avoidance responses significantly increased with an increase in the number of vessels and non-compliance with the local dolphin-watching guidelines. These behavioural responses are likely to have energetic costs for the dolphins, which may lead to decreased survival and reproductive success at individual and population levels. More restrictive regulations, increased surveillance and animal-based measures are key tools to adapt the conservation efforts in Reunion Island. Further studies on the island’s resident dolphin populations are necessary to ensure the continuity of dolphin-watching activities in a sustainable manner. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Observational studies describe rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) actively foraging during the day on epipelagic species. Using data from depth-transmitting satellite tags deployed on nine individuals off Kauaʻi, we investigated diving behavior and the effects of lunar phase and solar light levels on vertical movements. Overall, tagged rough-toothed dolphins primarily used near-surface waters, spending between 83.6% and 93.7% of their time in the top 30 m of the water column. When diving, grand mean, median, and maximum dive depths were 76.9 m, 67.5 m, and 399.5 m, although individuals were in water with depths from approximately 700–1,450 m. Dive rates varied by time of day, being lowest during the day and at dawn and highest at dusk and night. Dives were deepest (M = 133.7 m, SD = 52.6 m, median = 106.5 m) and longest (M = 4.0 min, SD = 0.4 min, median = 4.0 min) at dusk, suggesting dolphins were taking advantage of prey rising to the surface in response to reduced light levels. Lunar phase indirectly affected diving, with deeper and longer dives occurring with increasing illumination. The variations in dive behavior across solar and lunar cycles indicate diving patterns shift based on the distribution of prey. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: When a social species inhabits disparate environments with different requirements, it presents an ideal study framework for investigating plasticity in social structure. Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are wide-ranging offshore delphinids that generally form societies with fission-fusion dynamics within large schools and exhibit weak social bonds. In Port Phillip, southeastern Australia, common dolphins of the same species are, against expectations, resident to an embayment. Residency in this species provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether their social structure resembles that of their offshore conspecifics with weak social bonds, or whether bay living leads to stronger social bonds. We investigated the social structure of 12 resident adult common dolphins, between 2007 and 2014, in Port Phillip. Network analyses revealed nonrandom associations and several strong bonds, a social structure unusual for this species. The study shows that the social structure of a wide-ranging gregarious species in Port Phillip reflects the requirements of a confined environment with limited but predictable resources. Their social structure in the bay resembles that of inshore delphinids, rather than of its own species. Our study highlights the extreme plasticity in social structure that common dolphins are capable of and the importance of the environment for social bonds. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: The main aim of this work was to evaluate historical changes in the foraging ecology of Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) along its distributional range. Stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) were analyzed in bone samples from specimens deposited in scientific institutions from Brazil (BR), Uruguay (UY) and Argentina (ARG), collected in periods PI (1903–1980) and PII (1981–2016). The isotopic values of ARG dolphins were different from UY and BR in both periods, reflecting variations in the composition of the diet and/or basal isotopic values. The considerably broad isotopic niche of the ARG dolphins was maintained in PII, following the trend of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic values along the decades. In this area, mixing models showed a diet with a high proportion of demersal prey, mainly from coastal marine waters. Lahille's bottlenose dolphins from UY showed a stability in nitrogen isotopic values but increasing carbon isotope values through decades. This increasing trend was consistent with a lower use of the Río de la Plata estuarine waters by the species reported for the last decades. In these areas, the species also showed a high proportion of demersal fish species. Finally, ARG and UY dolphins showed a partial and a total isotopic niche segregation during Periods I and II, respectively, probably reflecting a spatial/ecological structuring in this region. BR and UY samples, on the other hand, were not statistically different, probably forming an ecological unit. The retrospective analysis of the Lahille's bottlenose dolphin diet contributed to the knowledge of the ecological structure and feeding behavior of this poorly-known subspecies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, allows for the estimation of animal age from blood or remotely sampled skin. This multi-tissue epigenetic age estimation clock uses 110 longitudinal samples from 34 Navy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), identifying 195 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites associated with chronological aging via cross-validation with one individual left out in each fold (R2 = 0.95). With a median absolute error of 2.5 years, this clock improves age estimation capacity in wild dolphins, helping conservation efforts and enabling a better understanding of population demographics. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract. A female pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) successfully mated with a mature male in captivity on April 13, 2017. This mating event was followed by an evaluation of the plasma progesterone concentration, appetite, and rectum temperature of the dolphin during pregnancy. We recorded the progesterone profiles during pregnancy, the gestation period, and the parturition events. The progesterone level (ng/mL) ranged between 0.7 and 133.4 (n = 27), and the average was 45.1 (SD = 38.5). Immediately after mating, extremely high progesterone levels were observed, which showed a decreasing trend towards the parturition day. The gestation period was 352 days. On the morning of the parturition day on March 31, the female displayed symptoms such as a drop in rectal temperature by approximately 1°C and reduced appetite. The time from the first observation of vaginal discharge to the fluke's appearance was 5.5 hr, while the subsequent period until birth was 4 hr in length. The time from parturition to the first successful nursing was approximately 4 hr, while the time from the nursing to the placental passage was less than 1 hr. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the pregnancy period of pantropical spotted dolphins in captivity. ©

ABSTRACT: The franciscana is endemic to subtropical coastal waters of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, and is the only living species of the family Pontoporiidae. It is regarded as the most endangered cetacean in the western South Atlantic. Five management units are recognized (Franciscana Management Areas, FMAs – sensu Secchi et al., 2003a), with abundance estimates ranging from a few hundred to around 15,000 dolphins. Low reproductive potential and short life span make this species highly susceptible to current non-natural removal rates. Bycatch in gillnet fisheries occurs in high levels since the 1960s in Uruguay and 1980s in Brazil and Argentina. Although other threats exist, such as habitat degradation that includes physical (noise) and chemical pollution, depletion of fish stocks and climate change, incidental mortality in gillnets is currently the greatest threat to franciscanas. Fishing-related mortality ranges from approximately 100, in FMA I, to more than 1,000 in FMA III, and exceed from near two (in FMA IV) to more than five times (in FMA III) the maximum allowed sustainable mortality rate, based on potential biological removal (PBR) approach. These numbers indicate that the species is unlikely to cope with the current levels of bycatch and that urgent and extreme reduction on fishing practice and effort are required to avoid collapse of the franciscana and to lower its risk of extinction. Current mortality levels and projected declines resulted in the listing of the franciscana as “Vulnerable” in the IUCN Red List. Recent fisheries regulations were implemented in areas with extensive bycatch in Brazil and were expected to improve the species’ conservation status. There is evidence, however, that this regulation is insufficient to reduce fishing-related mortality to sustainable levels due to either or both lack of compliance and inadequate regulation strategies. Here we provide a comprehensive review on the franciscana ecology and threats and discuss perspectives for its conservation. © Copyright © 2021 Secchi, Cremer, Danilewicz and Lailson-Brito.

ABSTRACT: Presence-only data are typical occurrence information used in species distribution modelling. Data may be originated from different sources, and their integration is a challenging exercise in spatial ecology as detection biases are rarely fully considered. We propose a new protocol for presence-only data fusion, where information sources include social media platforms, to investigate several possible solutions to reduce uncertainty in the modelling outputs. As a case study, we use spatial data on two dolphin species with different ecological characteristics and distribution, collected in central Tyrrhenian through traditional research campaigns and derived from a careful selection of social media images and videos. We built a spatial log-Gaussian cox process that incorporates different detection functions and thinning for each data source. To finalize the model in a Bayesian framework, we specified priors for all model parameters. We used slightly informative priors to avoid identifiability issues when estimating both the animal intensity and the observation process. We compared different types of detection function and accessibility explanations. We showed how the detection function's variation affects ecological findings on two species representatives for different habitats and with different spatial distribution. Our findings allow for a sound understanding of the species distribution in the study area, confirming the proposed approach's appropriateness. Besides, the straightforward implementation in the R software, and the provision of examples' code with simulated data, consistently facilitate broader applicability of the method and allow for further validations. The proposed approach is widely functional and can be considered with different species and ecological contexts. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Heart rate monitoring in free-ranging cetaceans to understand their behavioural ecology and diving physiology is challenging. Here, we developed a simple, non-invasive method to monitor the heart rate of cetaceans in the field using an electrocardiogram-measuring device and a single suction cup equipped with an electrode. The unipolar suction cup was placed on the left lateral body surface behind the pectoral fin of Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and a false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) in captivity; their heart rate was successfully monitored. We observed large heart rate oscillations corresponding to respiration in the motionless whales during surfacing (a false killer whale, mean 47 bpm, range 20-75 bpm; Risso's dolphins, mean ± s.d. 61 ± 15 bpm, range 28-120 bpm, n = 4 individuals), which was consistent with the sinus arrhythmia pattern (eupneic tachycardia and apneic bradycardia) observed in other cetaceans. Immediately after respiration, the heart rate rapidly increased to approximately twice that observed prior to the breath. Heart rate then gradually decreased at around 20-50 s and remained relatively constant until the next breath. Furthermore, we successfully monitored the heart rate of a free-swimming Risso's dolphin. The all-in-one suction cup device is feasible for field use without restraining animals and is helpful in further understanding the diving physiology of free-ranging cetaceans.

ABSTRACT: Marine apex predators, such as coastal dolphins, are key components of ecosystem function and dynamics; understanding their spatial use therefore is important for conservation planning. Here, we describe spatial use of the threatened Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, within a mosaic of protected areas at their southern range in the Paranagua estuarine complex (PEC), Brazil. Based on environmental characteristics and S. guianensis population densities, individual photo-identification surveys were focused on two sectors of the northern mouth of the PEC between 2013 and 2015. We photo-identified 107 individuals and recorded 351 groups of Guiana dolphins; nearly 50% of which contained calves. Group sizes were small (mean ± SD: Sector 1 = 3.4 ± 2.7; Sector 2 = 3.6 ± 2.0) and ranged from 1 to 30 individuals. Clustering algorithms were applied to resighted, photo-identified Guiana dolphins to classify individuals as "residents"(sighted in 87% of surveys, n = 11) and "transients"(two clusters; 62%, n = 22; 95%, n = 72). All individuals predominantly were observed foraging (90% in Sector 1 and 76% in Sector 2), but spatial use by transient individuals differed from the residents in terms of environmental (slope, water depth, and rainfall) and behavioral factors (presence of calves and foraging behavior). Compared to transients, resident dolphins ranged over smaller areas, typically more suitable for feeding, calf caring, and more protected from predators and vessels. Because resident Guiana dolphins exhibit small home ranges, they are particularly vulnerable to local anthropogenic activities and habitat loss. These characteristics imply a strong need for regionalized management plans to reduce negative impacts and to maintain the ecological functionality of the species.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Observer-based counts and photo-identification are two well-established methods with an extensive use in cetacean studies. Using these two methods, group size has been widely reported, especially for small dolphins. Both methods may come with potential errors in estimating the group size, yet there is still a lack of comparison between both methods over a broad range of group size. Particularly, biogeographical variances in group size estimates were often mixed with methodological variances, making it difficult to compare estimates from different geographic regions. Here, group size estimates of a small, shallow-water, and near-shore delphinid species, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), were simultaneously sampled using observer-based counts and photo-identification at three regions in the northern South China Sea. Data showed that dolphin group size from two methods were highly variable and associated with sampling regions. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) indicated that dolphin group size significantly differed among regions. Statistical examinations further demonstrated dolphin group size could be affected by a complex combination of methodological and biogeographical variances. A common hurdle to examine potential factors influencing the estimation process is the inability to know the true group size at each sample. Therefore, other methods that could generate comparable estimates to represent true group size are warranted in future studies. To conclude, our findings present a better understanding of methodological and biogeographical variances in group size estimates of humpback dolphins, and help yield more robust abundance and density estimation for these vulnerable animals. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Lin, Tang, Dong, Zhang, Lusseau and Li.

ABSTRACT: Indus Blind Dolphin is endangered species sighted in the Indus River from the Indus delta upstream to the Himalayan foothills prior to building barrages but the maximum number of this mammal is found in Guddu to Sukkur reach and lowest number at upstream of Guddu barrage and downstream of Sukkur barrage. Driving forces for water and dolphin reserve conservation are an agriculture-environmental trade-off, water use and alteration of rivers for irrigation and agriculture and inadequate consideration on the habitat of highly valuable species such as Platanista gangetica minor, water demand increase with urban development and industrial activities, water pollution from Industries and agriculture wastewater, fishery-dolphin conflict causes physical damage to dolphins by boat and unintended dolphins/fish catch by gillnet.This paper presents the assessment of threats to Indus dolphin population growth, water quality, and other risk activities in stretch Guddu to Sukkur barrages. The total 1419 Indus dolphin was counted during a survey of dolphin in 2019, while918 in2011 respectively between Guddu and Sukkur Barrages. As result, 501 Indus dolphin number has increased in a period of 8 years. The analyzed results reveal that all the tested parameters ie. pH; Cond, TDS; Cl, TH, Alk, SO4, and NO2 are within the permissible limits as per standards NEQS and WHO. Moreover, the Standard Deviation of all parameters shows low deviation at different locations. The correlation matrix of all parameters of collected samples.

ABSTRACT: Population structure of highly mobile marine organisms can be complex and difficult to study, but it is important to understand how populations partition themselves within their environment for accurate assessment of both natural and anthropogenic impacts and successful management. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill negatively impacted common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) within Mississippi Sound and the surrounding north central Gulf of Mexico (GOMx); however, little was known about their underlying population structure in these waters. Thus, it was unclear how many demographically independent populations were affected by the spill. Common bottlenose dolphin samples were collected throughout inshore waters of Mississippi Sound and coastal waters of the north-central GOMx. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequence data and 19 nuclear microsatellite loci were analysed to determine how many populations are present and characterize their range throughout these waters. Bayesian clustering and migration analyses identified two genetically distinct and demographically independent populations: one predominantly inhabiting Mississippi Sound and adjacent coastal waters, and a second population extending generally from offshore of Mobile Bay, Alabama, east along the Florida Panhandle. Neither of these populations align with the currently delineated management stocks previously used to estimate impacts from the oil spill on common bottlenose dolphins in this portion of the GOMx. These results suggest that revisions may be necessary so that management stocks accurately represent the demographically independent populations present in these waters. Furthermore, better comprehension of underlying population structure will enhance impact assessments on common bottlenose dolphins and provide more appropriate baseline data to support future restoration and conservation objectives. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Increasing levels of anthropogenic underwater noise have caused concern over their potential impacts on marine life. Offshore renewable energy developments and seismic exploration can produce impulsive noise which is especially hazardous for marine mammals because it can induce auditory damage at shorter distances and behavioral disturbance at longer distances. However, far-field effects of impulsive noise remain poorly understood, causing a high level of uncertainty when predicting the impacts of offshore energy developments on marine mammal populations. Here we used a 10-year dataset on the occurrence of coastal bottlenose dolphins over the period 2009–2019 to investigate far-field effects of impulsive noise from offshore activities undertaken in three different years. Activities included a 2D seismic survey and the pile installation at two offshore wind farms, 20–75 km from coastal waters known to be frequented by dolphins. We collected passive acoustic data in key coastal areas and used a Before-After Control-Impact design to investigate variation in dolphin detections in areas exposed to different levels of impulsive noise from these offshore activities. We compared dolphin detections at two temporal scales, comparing years and days with and without impulsive noise. Passive acoustic data confirmed that dolphins continued to use the impact area throughout each offshore activity period, but also provided evidence of short-term behavioral responses in this area. Unexpectedly, and only at the smallest temporal scale, a consistent increase in dolphin detections was observed at the impact sites during activities generating impulsive noise. We suggest that this increase in dolphin detections could be explained by changes in vocalization behavior. Marine mammal protection policies focus on the near-field effects of impulsive noise; however, our results emphasize the importance of investigating the far-field effects of anthropogenic disturbances to better understand the impacts of human activities on marine mammal populations. © Copyright © 2021 Fernandez-Betelu, Graham, Brookes, Cheney, Barton and Thompson.

ABSTRACT: While polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-related risks have been reported at the cellular, organ, and individual levels in some marine mammals, studies quantifying the PCB-associated population-level effects are limited. Here, we combined chemical analysis and individual-based model simulation to investigate the impact of PCBs on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (sub)population from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). An annual PCB accumulation rate of 0.29 ± 0.07 mg/kg lipid per year was estimated based on the measured age-specific male data as males continue to accumulate PCBs throughout their lifetime, without depurating contaminant loads. Using the Taiwan Strait dolphin population with low PCBs as a baseline, we compare our model simulations in PRE population to estimate relative population impacts of PCBs and other stressors. When using the current vital rates of the PRE dolphins which have been affected by PCBs and other stressors (e.g., underwater noise, prey limitation, etc.), our simulations revealed a substantial decline (8.1%) in the annual population growth rate (λ) of PRE metapopulation compared to baseline over the next 100 years. At the estimated PCB accumulation rate, the PCB-mediated effects on calf survival and immunity would cause a slight decline (0.9%) in λ relative to baseline. Our findings suggest a relatively limited impact of PCBs on the long-term survival of PRE dolphins among all stressors. However, it should be noted that even under model simulations where dietary PCBs were eliminated, humpback dolphins would still need a long time to reduce their PCB burdens to a relatively “safe” level through biological cycling. Considering that the baseline vital rates might also have been affected by PCBs and other stressors, our results are considered relative rather than absolute. This study provides a starting point for quantifying population-level consequences of contaminant exposure on humpback dolphins, although more efforts are needed to perfect this type of analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Investigations of population structure across multiple niche dimensions can identify discrete management units within populations. This study examined social, spatial and isotopic niche partitioning in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) across ca. 600 km2 of coastal and estuarine waters in south-western Australia, to evaluate whether estuarine dolphins should be treated as a discrete management unit. Photo-identification data and tissue samples were collected in 2016 and 2017 in a study area covering the Peel-Harvey Estuary (PHE) and adjacent coastal waters. A total of 1,038 dolphin groups were encountered, and 481 individuals were identified. Tissue samples for stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) analyses were collected from 96 individuals. Social structure and complexity analyses were conducted, full and core activity spaces were identified, and their size estimated for identified social communities. Differences in stable isotope composition among individuals and communities were examined. A socially, spatially and isotopically distinct dolphin community occurred in the PHE. The coastal waters contained four socially and spatially, but not isotopically, distinct communities as well as a substantial number of dolphins (n = 185) that were sighted infrequently and therefore were not assigned to any community. Individuals formed three levels of relationships; the majority (78%) were weak association relationships (mean half-weight index 0.006). The estuarine community had significantly higher mean δ13C and significantly lower mean δ15N values than any of the coastal communities. There is a strong scientific basis for treating the PHE dolphin community as a discrete management unit. The estuarine and coastal communities occupied different social environments, with coastal individuals sharing space with more transient individuals. This study shows the value of integrating information from multiple niche dimensions when identifying management units, and the need to consider all encountered individuals in management planning. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Profiles of 33 PFAS analytes and 12 essential and non-essential trace elements were measured in livers of stranded common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) from New Zealand. PFAS concentrations reported were largely comparable to those measured in other marine mammal species globally and composed mostly of long-chain compounds including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA). PFAS profiles did not vary significantly by location, body condition, or life history. Notably, significant positive correlations were observed within respective PFAS and trace elements. However, only negative correlations were evident between these two contaminant types, suggesting different exposure and metabolic pathways. Age-associated concentrations were found for PFTrDA and four trace elements, i.e. silver, mercury, cadmium, selenium, indicating differences in the bioaccumulation biomagnification mechanisms. Overall, our results contribute to global understanding of accumulation of PFAS by offering first insights of PFAS exposure in cetaceans living within South Pacific Australasian waters. © 2021

ABSTRACT: The most flexible communication systems are those of open-ended vocal learners that can acquire new signals throughout their lifetimes. While acoustic signals carry information in general voice features that affect all of an individual's vocalizations, vocal learners can also introduce novel call types to their repertoires. Delphinids are known for using such learned call types in individual recognition, but their role in other contexts is less clear. We investigated the whistles of two closely related, sympatric common dolphin species, Delphinus delphis and Delphinus bairdii, to evaluate species differences in whistle contours. Acoustic recordings of single-species groups were obtained from the Southern California Bight. We used an unsupervised neural network to categorize whistles and compared the resulting whistle types between species. Of the whistle types recorded in more than one encounter, 169 were shared between species and 60 were species-specific (32 D. delphis types, 28 D. bairdii types). Delphinus delphis used 15 whistle types with an oscillatory frequency contour while only one such type was found in D. bairdii. Given the role of vocal learning in delphinid vocalizations, we argue that these differences in whistle production are probably culturally driven and could help facilitate species recognition between Delphinus species.

ABSTRACT: Stock assessment approaches are often oversimplified due to lack of biological knowledge and insufficient data. In spite of world-wide attention, fishery-targeted coastal dolphin species in Japan have lacked in-depth quantitative stock assessments because of limited time series of population size and an absence of associated biological information. We consequently developed integrated population models that analysed multiple sources of data simultaneously with published biological information within a Bayesian framework. We estimate population status and trends for three main species targeted by fisheries, bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, Risso's dolphins Grampus griseu, and short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus, using single-species age-aggregated and age-structured population dynamics models. Models were fit to absolute abundance estimates from systematic line-transect surveys, four series of abundance indices calculated from fisher's logbooks, and historical catch records. Published biological information was used to develop prior distributions for the biological parameters. We assessed the possible effects of ecological disturbance and competition using state-space and multispecies models. The multispecies model was selected by the model selection both for the age-aggregated and the age-structured approaches. Single-species assessments found that population size declined 4.2% (Risso's dolphin) to 8.0% (bottlenose dolphin) for three species since the late 1800s based on median posterior values, while the state-space and multispecies models found that environmental disturbance and an interaction among species could have reduced population size more substantially. Policy implications. Simple single-species models are often used to provide conservation and management advice for wild animals but, in this case, results from such models are overly optimistic because they overlook important ecological process. In contrast, current population status could be less favorable if environmental disturbance and interspecific competition actually control population dynamics. Even if that is not the case, considering ecological process in the model will provide more precautionary ways. Our approach of combining multiple modelling frameworks is applicable to many other management systems, and offers increased confidence in estimated status and trends over assessments that consider only a single model. © 2021 British Ecological Society

ABSTRACT: The proper management of cetacean populations requires life history and demographic parameters to be estimated at population level. In this study we focus on a reproductive pathology that has the potential to alter reproductive rate: the vaginal calculi or stones. The present work documents vaginal calculi prevalence and structure in the eastern North Atlantic common dolphin Delphinus delphis in order to infer their likely mechanisms of induction and possible effects on fecundity. The work is based on routine examinations and necropsies of stranded marine mammals reported by the French stranding scheme from 1972 to 2012. Vaginal calculi were described and measured, and their composition was analyzed by Fourrier-Transformed Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy. Necropsies and reproductive tract examinations were performed on 435 female common dolphins since 1972 along the French coasts, of which 14 showed vaginal calculi, representing 3.2% of the examined females. All females with calculi were older than 7, and there was no relationship of calculus size with age. Histopathology revealed lesions due to an inflammatory response to the presence of the calculi: chronicle vaginitis, variable endometritis and cystitis. Calculus size varied from 1 to 21 cm in maximum dimension and 4–1,460 g in mass. Their internal structure was homogeneous, particularly due to the absence of core material, hence corresponding to the definition of primary calculi. All calculus spectra showed almost identical compositions, with struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate) representing on average 87% of calculus mass. Dysfunction of the uro-genital tract, such as vesico-vaginal fistulae, would be the likely initial pathological condition that led to the formation of these stones. Both the initial chemical condition in the vagina and the resulting formation of a calculi are obstacles to successful reproduction. © Copyright © 2021 Dabin, Rochowski, Daudon and Ridoux.

ABSTRACT: Millions of people visit zoos and aquariums globally each year, with a smaller number choosing to participate in animal interaction programmes which allows visitors closer contact with individual animals. These are reportedly having mixed effects in increasing conservation-related behaviors. Human-animal interactions (HAIs) during these programmes are generally positive experiences for the human participants, however are there behavioral implications for the animals involved? The Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the most widely used cetacean for dolphin interactions, known as “swim with dolphin” (SWD) programmes. This study investigated visitor attachment to the dolphins they interacted with, whilst assessing behavioral implications of the dolphins. A total of 41 visitors to a Spanish dolphinarium, who participated in a SWD were surveyed using a modified version of the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale. Alongside this, 15-min continuous focal samples monitored three female dolphins (D1, D2, and D3) aged 22–40, split into pre (n = 96), during (n = 96) and post (n = 96) SWD. 80% of visitors reported a sense of attachment to the dolphin they interacted with. An exploratory factor analysis extracted three factors from the survey, these were “relationships,” “emotional attachment,” and “non-attachment.” A Friedmans two-way analysis of variance produced significant results for some behavior categories for each individual, including locomotory (D1: F2 = 9.556, p <.01), rest (D2: F2 = 14, p <.01, D3: F2 = 10.889, p <.01) and individual play (D1: F2 = 11.677, p <.01 D2: F2 = 6.353, p <.05) however, pairwise comparison showed no differences pre-post SWD. In this context it can be implied that participating in the SWD was neither enriching nor aversive for the individual animals, although due to the small sample size further research is required. As visitors reported a sense of attachment post HAI, this can have applications in improving conservation education during SWD. This study has provided scope for further research into methods that facilities can use to utilize the emotional attachment developed to individual animals to facilitate learning about conservation issues. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: To explore the potential macroscopic tissue effects of select remote biopsy tools to common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), carcasses were darted and their traumatic effects on the anatomy in target and non-target areas of the body were described. In total, 87 samples were collected (target area, n = 19; non-target area, n = 68) within standardized grid partitions from five carcasses of sub-adult to adult age classes with a range of body condition scores. We broadly classified impacts penetrating completely through the blubber into muscle or deeper internal tissues as over-penetrations (n = 51/87, 59%). For samples collected in the defined target area, there was a low number of over-penetrations (n = 5/51; 10%). However, for samples collected in the defined, non-target areas, a much higher number of over-penetrations occurred (n = 45/51 88%). A visual examination of some samples indicated that sample length and appearance may not be reliable guides to assess the penetration depth of the wounds. These preliminary results suggest samples collected in non-targeted areas could pose much higher risk to the individual. We encourage other researchers considering the use of remote biopsy tools to conduct similar assessments prior to field sampling to better understand the potential consequences of misplaced samples with a view towards continually improving remote biopsy tools and techniques for the benefit of cetacean welfare. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Behavioral phenotypic traits or “animal personalities” drive critical evolutionary processes such as fitness, disease and information spread. Yet the stability of behavioral traits, essential by definition, has rarely been measured over developmentally significant periods of time, limiting our understanding of how behavioral stability interacts with ontogeny. Based on 32 years of social behavioral data for 179 wild bottlenose dolphins, we show that social traits (associate number, time alone and in large groups) are stable from infancy to late adulthood. Multivariate analysis revealed strong relationships between these stable metrics within individuals, suggesting a complex behavioral syndrome comparable to human extraversion. Maternal effects (particularly vertical social learning) and sex-specific reproductive strategies are likely proximate and ultimate drivers for these patterns. We provide rare empirical evidence to demonstrate the persistence of social behavioral traits over decades in a non-human animal. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Here we provide a first assessment of microplastics (MPs) in stomach contents of 15 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) from both single and mass stranding events along the New Zealand coast between 2019 and 2020. MPs were observed in all examined individuals, with an average of 7.8 pieces per stomach. Most MPs were fragments (77%, n = 90) as opposed to fibres (23%, n = 27), with translucent/clear (46%) the most prevalent colour. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed polyethylene terephthalate (65%) as the most predominant polymer in fibres, whereas polypropylene (31%) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (20%) were more frequently recorded as fragments. Mean fragment and fibre size was 584 μm and 1567 μm, respectively. No correlation between total number of MPs and biological parameters (total body length, age, sexual maturity, axillary girth, or blubber thickness) was observed, with similar levels of MPs observed between each of the mass stranding events. Considering MPs are being increasingly linked to a wide range of deleterious effects across taxa, these findings in a typically pelagic marine sentinel species warrants further investigation. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Dolphins interact with many types of fishing gear, causing damage to fishing activities and in some cases facing harm and becoming entangled as bycatch. In this study, the behaviour of bottlenose dolphins during their interaction with set nets, equipped with and without interactive pingers, was investigated. Acoustic monitoring of the nets was conducted for a total of 56 hauls and 814.9 hr of recordings, from the 16 October to 13 November 2015, along the coast of Lampedusa island (Sicilian Channel, Italy, Mediterranean Sea). The level of interaction between dolphins and the nets was evaluated considering the number of dolphin clicks grouped over time (single acoustic incursion on each net), the duration of every acoustic incursion, and the number of dolphin clicks per incursion. Moreover, the catch rate was measured as the number of fish per hour for each net. Based on the recording time of dolphin clicks, the spatio-temporal development of the interaction with the nets located in different bays of the island was assessed. The duration of the interaction between dolphins and nets significantly increased over the study period, with a concomitant reduction in catch rate. The interactive pinger showed efficacy in protecting the nets from dolphin depredation during the first period of 36 hauls and 11 fishing days (higher catch rates and lower incursion durations), whereas no differences were found in any interaction parameters between pinger and control nets in the second period (20 hauls and six fishing days). Interactive pingers may be an effective, short-term (2–3 weeks) tool in deterring depredation by bottlenose dolphins in small-scale artisanal fisheries. Other mitigation approaches, such as gear modification, lessons learned through outreach, and passive acoustic monitoring of the nets, could improve the management of the interactions between fisheries and bottlenose dolphins. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Understanding baseline hormone levels, the magnitude of intra-individual variability, and their variation as a function of life history is difficult in toothed whales (e.g. dolphins and porpoises) because of the effects of capture stress. To determine the endocrine profile of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) as a function of season, time of day (TOD), age, sex, and reproductive status, blood corticosteroids, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were repeatedly measured in a managed-care population exposed to ambient light and water temperatures of San Diego Bay. Additionally, fecal hormone metabolites were assessed for cortisol, aldosterone, and triiodothyronine. Samples were collected at two to four-week intervals over a period of two years, and multiple times within a day at monthly intervals over a year. Samples were collected through the voluntary participation of the dolphins in the blood draws and fecal collections in order to avoid the effects of handling stress. All serum hormones except aldosterone significantly varied with season and all serum hormones except total thyroxine significantly varied as a function of TOD. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites significantly correlated with circulating cortisol levels, and there was a significant seasonal effect on triiodothyronine fecal metabolites. Strong seasonal effects demonstrated complex interactions with age and sex suggesting that contextual information is critical to interpreting differences in endocrine profiles. Strong circadian patterns further suggest that sampling design is important to the interpretation of blood or fecal collections, particularly since diurnal changes in some serum hormone levels are similar to the magnitude of seasonal differences. Despite potential impacts of feeding schedules on diurnal patterns, managed care populations can provide important insights into seasonal and age-related endocrine changes in toothed whales. © 2021 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The placental transfer and congener composition of organic contaminants (OCs) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins have been little studied. In the present study, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 18 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and 28 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were analyzed in muscle, lung, liver, kidney, and blubber tissues from three mother–fetus pairs of this species stranded along the Pearl River Estuary, China. For PCBs, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-chlorobenzene congeners were dominant in all the analyzed samples. Among them, hexachlorobenzene congeners showed the highest level in most dolphin mother-fetus tissue samples. The concentrations of PCBs and OCPs in adult females were higher in the detoxification organs (liver and kidneys) than in the muscles and lungs, whereas muscle tissues in fetuses generally exhibited higher PCBs and OCPs levels than the livers and kidneys. The most abundant PAHs in the four tissues were those with lower molecular weights, which were also the most water-soluble and bioavailable. Negative correlations between the octanol/water partition coefficients (log KOW) and the fetus/mother ratios for PCB congeners revealed that the transfer of PCBs may be determined by their lipid solubility. OCPs and PCBs with low molecular weights and low log KOW values would be more likely to accumulate in the dolphin liver, lung, kidney and muscle tissues. Furthermore, OCs with low molecular weights and low log KOW values were more concentrated in the fetal blubber, lung, and liver tissues than in their respective mothers. The ubiquitous existence of OCs in the mother–fetus pairs strongly suggested that these contaminants could pass through the placenta and partition in fetal tissue. The high transfer efficiency of PAHs and PCBs indicated that the placenta might not be an efficient barrier for these pollutants. PCBs levels in both mother and fetus dolphins could cause immunosuppression. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: During January and November 2011 seven bottlenose dolphins (three males and four females) were captured sampled and tagged with satellite-linked devices in Terminos, lagoon Campeche, Mexico. We used tags Model MK -10 made by Wildlife Computers. Along two and four weeks the dolphins were tracked and showed that they use the north central part of the Terminos Lagoon and occasionally some animals move out to the Gulf of Mexico. Along two and four weeks the dolphins were tracked and showed that they use the north central part of the Terminos Lagoon and occasionally some animals move out to the Gulf of Mexico. Seven bottlenose dolphins' status showed to good health but one of the females, the oldest, had skin wounds due to a virus or bacterial infections from bites as well as shark scars. The stresses due to the capture none they handled produce abandon common area. Females traveled using more than 260 to 340 km2 Estimated versus area occupied with 120 and 350 km2 from the males. All bottlenose dolphins assume high site fidelity and confirmed that. This area is very important for shelter, feeding and reproduction for the species. This is the first satellite tagging research project in the southern Gulf of Mexico for this species. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans have evolved elongated soft-tissue flipper with digits made of hyperphalangy. Cetaceans were found to have 2–3 more alanine residues in Hoxd13 than other mammals, which were suggested to be related to their flipper. However, how Hoxd13 regulates other genes and induces hyperphalangy in cetaceans remain poorly understood. Here, we overexpressed the bottlenose dolphin Hoxd13 in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Combined with transcriptome data and evolutionary analyses, our results revealed that the Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and Hedgehog signaling pathways and multiple genes might regulate hyperphalangy development in cetaceans. Meanwhile, the Notch and mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk) signaling pathways and Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) are probably correlated with interdigital tissues retained in the cetacean flipper. In conclusion, this is the first study to use a transgenic zebrafish to explore the molecular evolution of Hoxd13 in cetaceans, and it provides new insights into cetacean flipper formation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, is endangered and is one of the main target species for dolphin-watching in Brazil. This study aimed to investigate the compliance of routes of dolphin-watching boats in the Tibau do Sul Coastal Wildlife Reserve (REFAUTS) with the current legislation. The ‘route’ tool of a GPS navigation system enabled the recording of the route and speed of the boats and boat trip duration in the REFAUTS. The kernel map was constructed from the geographical coordinates during the tourist boat trips and showed the presence intensity of the tourist boats for Dolphin Bay and Madeiro Bay. At REFAUTS, tourist boats stayed longer and moved above the speed allowed by law. These boats showed low levels of compliance with the current legislation, which could result in damage to the Guiana dolphins. The prioritization of actions to promote the appropriate management of the REFAUTS, sustainability of tourism, and the conservation of the Guiana dolphins should focus on the boat operators and tourists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Abstract: This study was focused on the investigation of the spatiotemporal structure of the local population of the Black Sea bottlenose dolphins and the identification of stable relationships between individuals in groups. Observations and acoustic records were performed in 2014–2018 in the coastal waters of the southeastern Crimea from Cape Meganom to Cape Agir. The main method used for identifying individuals was acoustic identification on the basis of the compiled catalogue of signature whistles, signals with a frequency contour shape unique for each dolphin. The combination of visual and acoustic identification methods made it possible to accurately record the number and migrations of dolphins, as well as to identify their stable associations that form the social structure of the community. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Prioritizing groupings of organisms or ‘units’ below the species level is a critical issue for conservation purposes. Several techniques encompassing different time-frames, from genetics to ecological markers, have been considered to evaluate existing biological diversity at a sufficient temporal resolution to define conservation units. Given that acoustic signals are expressions of phenotypic diversity, their analysis may provide crucial information on current differentiation patterns within species. Here, we tested whether differences previously delineated within dolphin species based on i) geographic isolation, ii) genetics regardless isolation, and iii) habitat, regardless isolation and genetics, can be detected through acoustic monitoring. Recordings collected from 104 acoustic encounters of Stenella coeruleoalba, Delphinus delphis and Tursiops truncatus in the Azores, Canary Islands, the Alboran Sea and the Western Mediterranean basin between 1996 and 2012 were analyzed. The acoustic structure of communication signals was evaluated by analyzing parameters of whistles in relation to the known genetic and habitat-driven population structure. Results: Recordings from the Atlantic and Mediterranean were accurately assigned to their respective basins of origin through Discriminant Function Analysis, with a minimum 83.8% and a maximum 93.8% classification rate. A parallel pattern between divergence in acoustic features and in the genetic and ecological traits within the basins was highlighted through Random Forest analysis. Although it is not yet possible to establish a causal link between each driver and acoustic differences between basins, we showed that signal variation reflects fine-scale diversity and may be used as a proxy for recognizing discrete units. Conclusion: We recommend that acoustic analysis be included in assessments of delphinid population structure, together with genetics and ecological tracer analysis. This cost-efficient non-invasive method can be applied to uncover distinctiveness and local adaptation in other wide-ranging marine species. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although oral cytology using Papanicolaou stain is useful for the early detection of oral premalignant lesions and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in people, little work has been conducted on this topic in veterinary medicine. This paper describes the features of oral cytology using Papanicolaou stain and immunocytochemistry on liquid-based cytology slides in a case of oral SCC in an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). In this case, dysplastic cells with koilocyte-like changes and SCC cells were identified using the Papanicolaou stain. These cells were positive for p53 using an immunocytochemistry analysis. A cytologic diagnosis of SCC was made. We believe that the early detection of premalignant oral lesions and SCC in dolphins can be significantly improved with cytology using liquid-based cytology, Papanicolaou staining, and immunocytochemistry. © 2021 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are well-regarded sentinels for toxin exposure and can bioaccumulate a cyanotoxin called β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) that has been linked to human neurodegenerative disease. The same dolphins also possessed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), suggesting a possible association between toxin exposure and neuropathology. However, the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in dolphins and the impact cyanotoxins have on these processes are unknown. Here, we evaluate BMAA exposure by investigating transcription signatures using PCR for dolphin genes homologous to those implicated in AD and related dementias: APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, MAPT, GRN, TARDBP, and C9orf72. Immunohistochemistry and Sevier Münger silver staining were used to validate neuropathology. Methylmercury (MeHg), a synergistic neurotoxicant with BMAA, was also measured using PT-GC-AFS. We report that dolphins have up to a three-fold increase in gene transcription related to Aβ+ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and TDP-43+ intracytoplasmic inclusions. The upregulation of gene transcription in our dolphin cohort paralleled increasing BMAA concentration. In addition, dolphins with BMAA exposures equivalent to those reported in AD patients displayed up to a 14-fold increase in AD-type neuropathology. MeHg was detected (0.16–0.41 µg/g) and toxicity associated with exposure was also observed in the brain. These results demonstrate that dolphins develop neuropathology associated with AD and exposure to BMAA and MeHg may augment these processes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Social living, long lifespan and advanced cognitive skills provided favourable conditions for the development of pro-social behaviours and cooperative activities in cetacean. Dolphins have been observed to collaborate for various purposes, finding food, finding mates or raising and teaching younger individuals. This study investigated the potential impact of demographic factors (sex and age), social factors (relatedness and group size), and individual experience in a cooperative problem solving task. A cognitive enrichment device was tested with 22 dolphins in 11 group settings. The device consisted of a tube, containing ice and fish, sealed by two caps with rope handles and designed to be operated by pairs of dolphins. The investigation focused on the differences in trial outcome (success rate of cooperative opening of the device) and on cooperative play (dolphin pairs engaging in synchronous swim with the device). From the five potential factors, sex showed the highest impact. Cooperative openings were more than four times more frequent in males than in females (75% vs 17%, respectively), and cooperative play was exclusively displayed by adult males. Given the strong correlation between cooperative opening and cooperative play, we argue the two behaviours can be regarded as parts of a cooperative action chain. This study provides the first evidence for intersexual differences in collaborative actions in dolphins under systematic testing conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) has been reported to prefer estuary habitats. This study explored the environmental factors affecting a critically endangered population off the coast of Yunlin, Taiwan. We measured dolphin sighting rates and estuary characteristics affected by the watershed, including seven physical factors (watershed rainfall, watershed runoff, estuarine turbidity, pH, salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) and two biological factors (estuarine net primary production and chlorophyll a concentration), at the Hsinhuwei River estuary in Taiwan. Dolphin activity was measured by sighting rate and behavioral indices for feeding and traveling between 2017 and 2018. We observed that when the maximum net production increased alongside rising temperatures in spring, both the dolphin sighting rate and foraging activity increased. This trend was maintained until heavy rainfall or increased river runoff occurred during late summer, which resulted in high turbidity in autumn and winter. Turbidity was significantly negatively correlated with dolphin activity (sighting rate and foraging). Furthermore, we found that dolphin traveling positively correlated with the chlorophyll a concentration and maximum net production factors, which could attract dolphins expecting more abundant prey fish in the estuary supported by the high primary production. This study provides empirical evidence on how estuary characteristics affected by the watershed can affect the sighting rate and behavioral activities of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. © Copyright © 2021 Lin, Lin, Suen and Chou.

ABSTRACT: Although burst pulses are the least studied sounds produced by odontocetes, their characterisation is essential to describe the acoustic repertoire of a species. This study aimed to characterise burst pulses produced by Guiana dolphins and propose a visual method to classify these sounds into structural categories. Data collection occurred during boat surveys in south-eastern Brazil. Five acoustic parameters were extracted: number of pulses, duration, interclick interval, click repetition rate, and minimum frequency. All sounds were visually classified into four categories and used in a discriminant function analysis. In addition, a K-means cluster was used to compare the visual classification with this unsupervised grouping method and confirm the representativeness of each category. According to the discriminant analysis, most sounds were correctly classified (77%) into the four categories. Both methods grouped burst pulses in similar patterns, confirming the use of the categories. Click repetition rate was the most important parameter to separate categories. The variation in this parameter could be related to different behaviours as already suggested for other species. Thus, each category could have a different function in Guiana dolphin communication. The visual classification method is efficient and could be used for other species that produce pulsed sounds. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The estuary of Río de la Plata, in the eastern coast of South America, is a highly anthropized area that brings a high load of contaminants to the surrounding waters, which may have detrimental effects on the local marine fauna. The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a small cetacean species endemic of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN red list. In this study, we assessed the concentrations of 13 trace elements in bone samples from 100 franciscana dolphins that were found stranded dead or incidentally bycaught in the Río de la Plata and adjacent coast between 1953 and 2015. Elements were, in decreasing order of mean concentrations: Zn > Sr > Fe > Al > Mn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Ni > As > Hg > Cd > Se. The concentrations of Al, Cr and Fe were slightly higher in females than in males. The concentrations of As, Ni, and Pb significantly decreased with body length. Throughout the study period, the concentrations of Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni significantly increased, while the concentrations of As, Pb and Sr significantly decreased. The increasing trends may be due to increased inputs from river discharges, the leather industry and petroleum refineries, while the decrease in Pb may be due to the ban in the use of this element as an additive in gasoline and as component of car batteries. This investigation supports the validity of analysing trace element in bone, a tissue available in scientific collections and museums, to retrospectively examine variation over long temporal scales and thus assess long-term trends in pollution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Shark predation risk impacts many facets of dolphin life, including habitat use and foraging strategies. Because direct predation is rarely observed, researchers instead examine dolphins in situ for past injuries that can be attributed to sharks. We analyzed existing photo-ID catalogs of common bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) and Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) off Bimini, The Bahamas. A minimum of 29% of individual T. truncatus had evidence of a past, nonlethal shark bite, while for S. frontalis this was only 15%. For both species, shark-induced injuries were predominantly on the dorsal side. Regression analyses indicated that T. truncatus were more likely to have shark bite scars than S. frontalis and the likelihood of documenting a shark bite scar increased with a higher percentage of the body photographed. T. truncatus were less likely to have scars in the dorsal region, but sampling differences could have influenced these results. While the shark species responsible for scars was not determined, T. truncatus and S. frontalis overlap spatially and temporally with tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) and bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) off Bimini. This study builds on the understanding of dolphin/shark interactions from longitudinal studies of dolphins in this region, providing insight into factors influencing predation risk. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of mobile mcr genes mediating resistance to colistin is a critical public health issue that has hindered the treatment of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens in humans and other animals. We report the emergence of the mcr-9.1 gene in a polymyxin-resistant extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacter kobei infecting a free-living franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), threatened with extinction in South America. Genomic analysis confirmed the presence of genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant β-lactam [blaCTX-M-15, blaACT-9, blaOXA-1 and blaTEM-1B], aminoglycoside [aac(3)-IIa, aadA1, aph(3'')-Ib and aph(6)-Id], trimethoprim [dfrA14], tetracycline [tetA], quinolone [aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB1], fosfomycin [fosA], sulphonamide [sul2] and phenicol [catA1 and catB3] antibiotics. The identification of mcr-9.1 in a CTX-M-15-producing pathogen infecting a critically endangered animal is of serious concern, which should be interpreted as a sign of further spread of critical priority pathogens and their resistance genes in threatened ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) use whistles to communicate with their conspecifics. Little is known about the acoustic repertoire of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in waters southwest of Hainan Island, a newly recorded population in 2014. In this study, whistles of Hainan humpback dolphin population were collected by using autonomous acoustic recorders. The fundamental frequencies and durations of whistles were in ranges of 0.71–21.35 kHz and 0.06–2.22 s, respectively. Significant intraspecific differences in duration and frequency of whistles were found between the Hainan population and the other geographically neighboring populations (in Chinese waters) or the population in Malaysia waters. Compared with other Sousa species, significant interspecific differences were also observed. Based on clustering analysis, the whistle parameters of neighboring populations were likely similar to each other. Significant differences were found between humpback dolphins in waters southwest of Hainan Island and those dolphins in the neighboring areas, supporting the hypothesis that this population may be independent. Ambient noise measurements in waters of Hainan Island, Zhanjiang, and Sanniang Bay showed that humpback dolphin populations may use whistles with longer duration, lower frequency, and fewer inflection points for more effective communication to adapt to a noisier environment. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) is a pathogen of great concern in free-ranging cetaceans. Confirmation and staging of morbillivirus infections rely on histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC), following molecular detection. As at the present time no specific antibodies (Abs) against DMV are available, two heterologous Abs have been used worldwide for the examinations of morbillivirus infections of cetaceans. One is a monoclonal Ab (MoAb) prepared against the N protein of canine distemper virus (CDV), whereas the other is a polyclonal Ab raised in rabbits against rinderpest virus (RPV). Both Abs are known to show cross-reactivity with DMV. In this study we compared the labelling quality and the neuroanatomical distribution of staining with these two Abs by means of IHC analysis. To this end, serial sections of the target organs from ten free-ranging stranded cetaceans, previously diagnosed as being infected with DMV by PCR and/or serology, were subjected to IHC. The brain, lungs and lymph nodes of one animal were found to be positive with both Abs. From two other animals, the brain and the spleen, respectively, tested positive only with the polyclonal Ab. In the positive brain tissues, multifocal immunostaining was observed, with similar staining location and extent, with the two antibodies tested. Our results suggest that the polyclonal anti-RPV Ab might have a stronger binding activity to DMV than the anti-CDV MoAb. Nevertheless, the elaboration and use of specific anti-DMV Abs might be essential to guarantee conclusive results in diagnostic and pathogenetic investigations. © 2021 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals are thought to have an energetically expensive lifestyle because endothermy is costly in marine environments. However, measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE; kcal day−1) are available only for a limited number of marine mammals, because large body size and inaccessible habitats make TEE measurements expensive and difficult to obtain for many taxa. We measured TEE in 10 adult common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) living in natural seawater lagoons at two facilities (Dolphin Research Center and Dolphin Quest) using the doubly labeled water method. We assessed the relative effects of body mass, age and physical activity on TEE. We also examined whether TEE of bottlenose dolphins, and more generally of marine mammals, differs from that expected for their body mass compared with other eutherian mammals, using phylogenetic least squares (PGLS) regressions. There were no differences in body mass or TEE (unadjusted TEE and TEE adjusted for fat-free mass) between dolphins from the two facilities. Our results show that adjusted TEE decreased and fat mass increased with age. Different measures of activity were not related to age, body fat or adjusted TEE. Both PGLS and the non-phylogenetic linear regression indicate that marine mammals have an elevated TEE compared with that of terrestrial mammals. However, bottlenose dolphins expended 17.1% less energy than other marine mammals of similar body mass. The two oldest dolphins (>40 years) showed a lower TEE, similar to the decline in TEE seen in older humans. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show an age-related metabolic decline in a large non-human mammal. © 2021. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cetacean watching is an increasingly popular economic activity in Ecuador for tourism operators. Despite government regulations, cetacean watching can have a negative impact on observed animal populations. To enhance good dolphin-watching practices, a course was carried out in Puerto El Morro, Ecuador about sensitisation activities promoting empathy towards and knowledge about bottlenose dolphins, local avifauna and mangrove ecosystems. The course provided tourism operator staff with theoretical and practical knowledge on dolphin physiology and ecology, with a focus on empathy towards the species and on regulations to be respected during the watching tours. The course included interactive workshops, didactic materials, advice, video screening and structured conversations. Two innovative questionnaires were implemented on the boat during 68 dolphin-watching tours to evaluate whether the training course had improved the regulation compliance and on-tour guiding quality of the tour guides and boat drivers. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in dolphin-watching practices in compliance with the Regulations for the Whale and Dolphin Watching of Ecuador (p = .0002) and in guidance quality (p = .0004) after the training course. Boat drivers were identified as influential actors in compliance with regulations and should also be included in the environmental awareness training courses. The study showed that empathy-based sensitisation and knowledge reinforcement positively affect policy compliance and can generate new sustainable approaches for future dolphin-watching activities.  © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Per-and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chemicals used in a wide variety of commercial products and industrial applications. These chemicals are persistent, can accumulate in humans' and animals' tissues and in the environment, representing an increasing concern due to their moderate to highly toxicity. Their global distribution, persistence and toxicity led to an urgent need to investigate bioaccumulation also in marine species. In 2013 PFAS contamination was detected in a vast area in Veneto region, mainly in Adige and Brenta rivers. In order to investigate any relevant presence of these substances in marine vertebrates constantly living in the area, PFAS were measured in hepatic tissue samples of 20 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) stranded along the northern Adriatic Sea coastline between 2008 and 2020. Using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 17 target PFAS (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS, PFDS, PFHpS, PFPeS), were quantified in the samples. PFAS profiles were generally composed of the same five dominant PFAS (PFOS > PFUnA > PFDA ≈ PFDoA ≈ PFTrDA). The greatest PFOS concentration found was 629,73 ng/g wet weight, and PFOS accounted until 71% in the PFAS profiles. No significant differences between sexes were found, while calves showing higher mean values than adults, possibly indicating an increasing ability in the elimination of PFAS with age. Finally, a temporal analysis was carried out considering three different periods of time, but no temporal differences in concentrations were found. The results suggest that long-chain PFAS are widespread in bottlenose dolphins along the North Adriatic Sea. Furthermore, they represent a baseline to investigate the impact of PFAS on marine mammals’ conservation and health. Filling an important gap in the knowledge of PFAS accumulation in bottlenose dolphins, this study highlights the relevant role of Environmental and Tissue Banks for retrospective analyses on emergent contaminants. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In the Amazon, mercury (Hg) contamination comes from ASGM operations along with soil remobilization processes associated with deforestation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (THg) in 88 samples of skin and blubber tissue obtained from live captured river dolphins (Inia boliviensis, Inia geoffrensis, and Inia spp.) in the Madeira River Basin. THg and MeHg measurements were performed by CV-AAS and GC-AFS, respectively. We also calculated the daily intake rate (DIR) of THg (wet weight) by Inia spp. THg levels in blubber tissue of adult river dolphins (Inia spp.) ranged from 0.015 to 3.804 mg kg−1, while MeHg concentrations in blubber tissue varied from 0.04 to 2.65 mg kg−1 and in skin tissue from 0.09 to 0.66 mg kg−1. There were no significant differences in MeHg concentration in blubber (p = 0.616) and skin (p = 0.498) tissue samples between adult males and females in the different sampling locations. The adult animals showed differences in THg and MeHg concentrations significantly higher than in the calves. The estimate of the DIR of the genus Inia ranged from 1.17 to 12.35 μg kg−1 day−1 (bw), from the consumption of fish species with herbivorous to piscivorous habits, respectively. More biological and ecological data, such as the precise determination of age, mediated length, weight, and diet of river dolphins, are necessary to verify the Hg biomagnification. However, our data indicate that bioaccumulation is an active process in the dolphins of the Madeira River Basin.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife species are challenged by various infectious diseases that act as important demographic drivers of populations and have become a great conservation concern particularly under growing environmental changes. The new era of whole genome sequencing provides new opportunities and avenues to explore the role of genetic variants in the plasticity of immune responses, particularly in non-model systems. Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) has emerged as a major viral threat to cetacean populations worldwide, contributing to the death of thousands of individuals of multiple dolphin and whale species. To understand the genomic basis of immune responses to CeMV, we generated and analysed whole genomes of 53 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) exposed to Australia's largest known CeMV-related mortality event that killed at least 50 dolphins from three different species. The genomic data set consisted of 10,168,981 SNPs anchored onto 23 chromosome-length scaffolds and 77 short scaffolds. Whole genome analysis indicated that levels of inbreeding in the dolphin population did not influence the outcome of an individual. Allele frequency estimates between survivors and nonsurvivors of the outbreak revealed 15,769 candidate SNPs, of which 689 were annotated to 295 protein coding genes. These included 50 genes with functions related to innate and adaptive immune responses, and cytokine signalling pathways and genes thought to be involved in immune responses to other morbilliviruses. Our study characterised genomic regions and pathways that may contribute to CeMV immune responses in dolphins. This represents a stride towards clarifying the complex interactions of the cetacean immune system and emphasises the value of whole genome data sets in understanding genetic elements that are essential for species conservation, including disease susceptibility and adaptation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Red tide blooms caused by the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis are natural disturbance events that occur regularly along Florida’s west coast, often resulting in massive fish kills and marine mammal, seabird, and sea turtle mortalities. Limited prior work on the ecological effects of red tides suggests they play an important role in structuring ecosystem dynamics and regulating communities, however specific effects on prey populations and potential alterations to predator-prey interactions are unknown. We surveyed the prey fish assemblage of a top marine predator, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), in shallow seagrass habitat in Sarasota Bay, Florida, during 2004–2019, collecting data on prey density, species composition, K. brevis cell densities, and environmental variables. Across eight distinct red tide bloom events, resistance, resilience, and the ecological effects on the prey assemblage varied depending on bloom intensity, season, and frequency. Prey assemblage structure showed significant and distinct short-term shifts during blooms independent of the normal seasonal shifts in prey structure seen during non-bloom conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a strong influence of K. brevis density on assemblage structure. Blooms occurring primarily in the summer were associated with less initial prey resistance and higher than average annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) 1–3 years following bloom cessation, with bloom frequency prolonging the time needed to reach higher than average annual CPUE. Regardless of season, recovery to pre-bloom prey abundances occurred within 1 year. Sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation indicated significant differences in prey diversity among summer bloom events. This study is a first step in identifying differences in resistance, resilience, and the ecological effects of multiple red tide bloom events of various temporal scales and intensity on a dolphin prey assemblage. Improved understanding of the influence of red tides on estuarine structural dynamics and function can better inform management, and potentially guide mitigation efforts post-bloom. © Copyright © 2021 Berens McCabe, Wells, Toms, Barleycorn, Wilkinson and Palubok.

ABSTRACT: Understanding predator–prey relationships is critical in ecology, but relatively challenging when investigating elusive marine megafauna. In this study, we document the presence of shark-inflicted injuries on coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mesoamerican Reef System using photo-identification methods. We analyzed data from a total of 533 photo-identified bottlenose dolphins in Mexico (Ascención Bay, Espíritu Santo Bay, and Chetumal Bay), Belize (Turneffe Atoll, Drowned Cayes, Barrier Reef, and Placencia), and Honduras (Utila). We identified 16 individuals with shark-inflicted injury scars consistent with attacks by large sharks of the Family Carcharhinidae. Additionally, two bottlenose dolphins were encountered with round-shaped crater wounds, likely inflicted by a cookiecutter shark (Isistius spp.). The prevalence of shark-inflicted wounds in bottlenose dolphins varied markedly between sites, with the highest prevalence in Placencia and Ascención Bay (Mexico), and lowest in Turneffe Atoll and Drowned Cayes (Belize). Further research is required to evaluate how predation risk shapes the ecology of bottlenose dolphins in the Mesoamerican Reef region. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Brucella ceti, associated with neurobrucellosis, has been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of postmortem cetaceans. A 106-kg, stranded female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) presented with serum antibodies to Brucella spp. via competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence polarization assay. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of whole blood, bronchoalveolar fluid, and rectal, nasal, and genital swabs for Brucella spp. were consistently negative. Serial computed tomography revealed mild focal dilatation of brain ventricles. CSF sampling was warranted to exclude neurobrucellosis. Sedation was achieved with 30 mg diazepam (0.28 mg/kg) orally 2.5 hours prior to arrival in hospital, followed by 5.3 mg midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) intramuscularly, and anesthetic induction with 2.5 mg midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) and 200 mg propofol (2 mg/kg) administered slowly intravenously, followed by intubation and maintenance on sevoflurane using controlled mechanical and apneustic anesthesia ventilation. The atlanto-occipital joint was opened by flexing the upper cervical region with the animal in left lateral recumbency. A 20-ga × 6-inch spinal needle was advanced into the cisterna magna using radiographic guidance. CSF was collected successfully with no neurological deficits appreciable on recovery. Brucella spp. was not identified via PCR or culture. This represents the first report of an antemortem CSF tap in a cetacean.  © Copyright 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Conservation management of wildlife species should be underpinned by knowledge of their distribution and abundance, as well as impacts of human activities on their populations and habitats. Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are subject to incidental capture in a range of Australia’s commercial fisheries including gill netting, purse seining and mid-water trawling. The impact these fishery interactions have on common dolphin populations is uncertain, as estimates of abundance are lacking, particularly for the segments of the populations at risk of bycatch and in greater need of protection. Here we used double-observer platform aerial surveys and mark-recapture distance sampling methods to estimate the abundance of common dolphins in 2011 over an area of 42,438 km2 in central South Australia, where incidental mortality of common dolphins due to fisheries bycatch is the highest. We also used the potential biological removal (PBR) method to estimate sustainable levels of human-caused mortality for this segment of the population. The estimated abundance of common dolphins was 21,733 (CV = 0.25; 95% CI = 13,809–34,203) in austral summer/autumn and 26,504 in winter/spring (CV = 0.19; 95% CI = 19,488–36,046). Annual PBR estimates, assuming a conservative maximum population growth rate of Rmax = 0.02 and a recovery factor of Fr = 0.5 for species of unknown conservation status, ranged from 189 (summer/autumn) to 239 dolphins (winter/spring), and from 378 (summer/autumn) to 478 dolphins (winter/spring) with an Rmax = 0.04. Our results indicate that common dolphins are an abundant dolphin species in waters over the central South Australian continental shelf (up to 100 m deep). Based on the 2011 abundance estimates of this species, the highest estimated bycatch of common dolphins (423 mortalities in 2004/05) in the southern Australian region exceeded the precautionary PBR estimates for this population segment. Recent bycatch levels appear to be below PBR estimates, but low observer coverage and underreporting of dolphin mortalities by fishers means that estimates of dolphin bycatch rates are not robust. The effects of cumulative human impacts on common dolphins are not well understood, and thus we recommend a precautionary management approach to manage common dolphin bycatch based on local abundance estimates. © Copyright © 2021 Parra, Bilgmann, Peters and Möller.

ABSTRACT: Commerson’s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) are separated into the subspecies C. c. commersonii, found along southern South America (SA) and the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (FI/IM), and C. c. kerguelenensis, restricted to the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands (KI). Following the dispersal model proposed for the genus, the latter is thought to have originated from SA after a long-distance dispersal event. To evaluate this biogeographic scenario, a distribution-wide, balanced sampling of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences was designed. New tissue samples from southern Chile, Argentina, FI/IM, and KI were added to published sequences from SA and KI, for a total of 256 samples. Genetic diversity indices, genetic and phylogeographic structure, and migration rates were calculated. One haplotype was shared between subspecies, with which all haplotypes of C. c. kerguelenensis formed a distinct group in the haplotype network. A new haplotype for C. c. kerguelenensis is reported. Differentiation in haplotype frequencies was found among localities within the distribution of C. c. commersonii, yet the phylogeographic signal was only statistically significant between subspecies. Coalescent-based historical gene flow estimations indicated migration between the northern and southern portions of the species’ range in SA as well as between SA and the FI/IM, but not between these and the KI. The net nucleotide divergence between dolphins from SA and the FI/IM was lower than the recommended threshold value suggested for delimiting subspecies, unlike that found between C. c. commersonii and C. c. kerguelenensis. The results are consistent with the model of post-glacial colonization of KI by South American C. commersonii, followed by an ongoing divergence process and subspecies status. Thus, C. c. kerguelenensis may represent the most recent diversification step of Cephalorhynchus, where isolation from their source population is driving a process of incipient speciation.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammal vocal elements have been investigated for decades to assess whether they correlate with stress levels or stress indicators. Due to their acoustic plasticity, the interpretation of dolphins’ acoustic signals of has been studied most extensively. This work describes the acoustic parameters detected in whistle spectral contours, collected using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), in a bycatch event that involved three Bottlenose dolphins during midwater commercial trawling. The results indicate a total number of 23 upsweep whistles recorded during the bycatch event, that were analyzed based on the acoustic parameters as follows: Dr, total duration (1.09 ± 0.8825th –1.2475th); fmax maximum frequency, (11160 ± 1129325th –1181075th); fmin, minimum frequency (5836.4 ± 5635.325th –5967.175th); fc, central frequency; (8665.2 ± 8492.925th–18982.8 75th); frequency; BW, bandwidth (5836.4 ± 5635.325th –5967.175th); Step, number of step (5 ± 425th –675th ). Furthermore, our data show that vocal production during the capture event was characterized by an undescribed to date combination of two signals, an ascending whistle (upsweep), and a pulsed signal that we called “low-frequency signal” in the frequency band between 4.5 and 7 kHz. This capture event reveals a novel aspect of T. truncatus acoustic communication, it confirms their acoustic plasticity, and suggests that states of discomfort are conveyed through their acoustic repertoire. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Global Streptococcus agalactiae and related pathogen infections are increasing, and place both wildlife species and humans at risk. Notably, Streptococcus agalactiae is now considered to be an emerging and zoonotic pathogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated against bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, and spotted eagle ray, Aetobatus narinari, IgM, and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, IgG. Along with a previously generated mAb against loggerhead, Caretta caretta, IgY, these biological reagents were used to compare the sensitivity of relative antibody titers at sample dilutions of 1:200 in buffer to calculated antibody activities against whole cell Streptococcus agalactiae in wild captured individuals. Robust antibody responses were observed in each species, though some individuals differed significantly depending on whether viewed as relative antibody titers at sample dilutions of 1:200 or as antibody activities. The data from this study indicate that calculated antibody activities are more informative than relative antibody titers in determining antibody responses despite being more labor-intensive, expensive, and time consuming. This study provides several novel antibody reagents to the greater community of comparative immunologists, with a particular application to monitoring sentinel species for exposure to new emerging and zoonotic pathogens. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Background: The analysis of blow microbiota has been proposed as a biomarker for respiratory health analysis in cetaceans. Yet, we lack crucial knowledge on the long-term stability of the blow microbiota and its potential changes during disease. Research in humans and mice have provided evidence that respiratory disease is accompanied by a shift in microbial communities of the airways. We investigate here the stability of the community composition of the blow microbiota for 13 captive bottlenose dolphins over eight months including both sick and healthy individuals. We used barcoded tag sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Four of the dolphins experienced distinct medical conditions and received systemic antimicrobial treatment during the study. Results: We showed that each dolphin harboured a unique community of zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) that was present throughout the entire sampling period (‘intra-core’). Although for most dolphins there was significant variation over time, overall the intra-core accounted for an average of 73% of relative abundance of the blow microbiota. In addition, the dolphins shared between 8 and 66 zOTUs on any of the sampling occasions (‘inter-core’), accounting for a relative abundance between 17 and 41% of any dolphin’s airway microbiota. The majority of the intra-core and all of the inter-core zOTUs in this study are commonly found in captive and free-ranging dolphins and have previously been reported from several different body sites. While we did not find a clear effect of microbial treatment on blow microbiota, age and sex of the dolphins did have such an effect. Conclusions: The airways of dolphins were colonized by an individual intra-core ‘signature’ that varied in abundance relative to more temporary bacteria. We speculate that the intra-core bacteria interact with the immune response of the respiratory tract and support its function. This study provides the first evidence of individual-specific airway microbiota in cetaceans that is stable over eight months. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Acoustic behaviour is a key component of specialized foraging tactics for many aquatic species, especially cetaceans. However, in recent decades the natural environment has been increasingly exposed to a variety of anthropogenic noise sources, with the potential to impact natural foraging specializations dependent on acoustic communication. Here we evaluated whether boat noise has the potential to impact a rare foraging tactic used by individuals from a small population of the vulnerable Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) specialized in cooperation with artisanal fishers in southern Brazil. We tested whether the presence of boats changed the acoustic behaviour of dolphins when engaged in this cooperative foraging. We found that whistles and echolocation click rates were lower when boats were present, suggesting that cooperative foraging may potentially be reduced or interrupted by the presence of boats. Whistle parameters changed in response to the number, type and speed of boats, indicating a behavioural change and acoustic masking. Locally, our results reinforce the need for boat traffic regulations to minimize their impacts on these endangered dolphins and their rare cooperative tactic. From a broad perspective, we demonstrate how nonlethal impacts such as vessel disturbance can manifest subtle changes in animals’ natural behaviour and, in this case, present an insidious threat to a unique foraging specialization. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) have some of the largest and most complex brains in the animal kingdom. When and why this trait evolved remains controversial, with proposed drivers ranging from echolocation to foraging complexity and high-level sociality. This uncertainty partially reflects a lack of data on extinct baleen whales (mysticetes), which has obscured deep-time patterns of brain size evolution in non-echolocating cetaceans. Building on new measurements from mysticete fossils, we show that the evolution of large brains preceded that of echolocation, and subsequently followed a complex trajectory involving several independent increases (e.g. in rorquals and oceanic dolphins) and decreases (e.g. in right whales and 'river dolphins'). Echolocating whales show a greater tendency towards large brain size, thus reaffirming cognitive demands associated with sound processing as a plausible driver of cetacean encephalization. Nevertheless, our results suggest that other factors such as sociality were also important.  © 2021 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

ABSTRACT: On 19 July 2019 an estimated 20 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were observed in the Marsdiep, a tidal inlet connecting the North Sea and the Dutch Wadden Sea, between Den Helder and the island of Texel. Photographs and video recordings were made and nine individuals were matched with known dolphins from the Moray Firth, NE Scotland. These are the first matches of this east coast of Scotland population outside the UK and Ireland. Subsequent observations of individuals from this group show that at least some of the animals have returned to Scottish waters, while others were photographed in Danish waters. Furthermore, we report on a photo identification match of a solitary bottlenose dolphin between France and the Netherlands. These matches suggest that bottlenose dolphins, in the Netherlands, originate from two different genetically distinct populations: 'Coastal South' and 'Coastal North'. This evidence of previously unknown long-range movements may have important implications for the conservation and management of this species in European waters. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Marine aquaculture, and its fast-growing development, has the potential for wider environmental, ecosystem, and biodiversity impacts. This study assesses the impact of fish farming on a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) population within the Gulf of Ambracia (western Greece) between 2007 and 2018. Two different study areas were defined in order to investigate differences on occurrence, abundance, behaviour, and seasonal fluctuations between them: a ‘control area’, in the north-western side of the Gulf; and a ‘fish farm area’, in the south west, where the highest density of fish farm cages is found. A total of 169 daily surveys were dedicated to the control area and 74 days were dedicated to the fish farm area, yielding 104 and 37 sightings, respectively. Both the probability of detecting dolphins (U = 6,763.000, P = 0.002) and the group sizes (U = 578.000, P < 0.001) were smaller around fish farms. Seasonality analyses were restricted to 2007–2008, as this was the period with year-round effort. Results revealed that dolphins were more frequently seen around fish farms in the winter (Kruskal–Wallis test, P = 0.036). From the 40 identified individuals that were re-sighted at least 10 times during the study period, 21 used the fish farm area less than expected according to sampling effort, and 10 of them were never observed in that area (binomial test, P < 0.05). The results revealed an impact of fish farms on the distribution of bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia. This information should be taken into consideration when defining ecosystem-based management measures within the management plan, which is currently in preparation for this Natura 2000 site. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that inhabit urban estuaries like Galveston Bay, Texas, are exposed to cumulative stressors including pollution, fisheries, shipping, freshwater inflows, and construction operations. With continuing development, it is imperative to understand the key environmental variables that make the Galveston Bay estuary suitable habitat for this protected species. The Galveston Bay Dolphin Research Program conducted monthly photo identification surveys of bottlenose dolphins in a previously understudied 186 km2 area in upper Galveston Bay (UGB). To understand occurrence patterns in this region, we calculated monthly encounter rates of dolphins (dolphins/km) for four consecutive years (2016–2019). Using multiple linear regression models, we investigated the relationship between encounter rates, and water temperature and salinity. Monthly encounter rates ranged from 0.00 to 1.23 dolphins/km with an average of 0.34 dolphins/km (SE = 0.05). Over 80% of the variance was explained by the predictor variables water temperature and salinity (R2 = 0.820). Water temperature had a positive linear effect on encounter rates at over 23.37°C (SE = 1.42). Accordingly, higher encounter rates occurred during months with warm temperatures (May–September) compared to cooler months (November–April), indicating a predictable yearly movement pattern. Moreover, salinity was a highly significant predictor variable, with encounter rates dropping linearly with decreases in salinity. Higher numbers of dolphins are found in UGB during summer, but an exodus of dolphins occurs with low salinity levels, regardless of the time of year and water temperature. These findings should be considered during infrastructure projects (i.e., flood gate system) that may alter dolphin habitat and prey availability. Copyright © 2021 Mintzer and Fazioli.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to determine the influence of distance and environmental parameters of water on Sotalia guianensis sounds. We used recordings of three distinct vocalisations for testing their propagation in places with different environmental characteristics in the Northeast and Southeast of Brazil. We observed that the propagation of all the sounds tested depended on the distance, turbidity, and concentration of oxygen dissolved in the water. Relative amplitude data for each sampled distance were smaller than the values predicted by the cylindrical spreading law. This result indicates that there are probably other factors that can influence sound propagation besides the distance in the sampled areas. The relative amplitude was also proportionally higher when there were lower levels of turbidity and higher concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water. From the data presented here, a model was generated that can be used as a tool to predict acoustic alterations of the environment against natural or anthropic changes in salinity, dissolved oxygen, and water turbidity. In addition, the methodology of this study is an important tool for conservation studies, for it can be replicated in other areas and with other species. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: How environmental features (e.g., people, enrichment, or other animals) affect movement is an important element for the study of animal behavior, biomechanics, and welfare. Here we present a stationary overhead camera-based persistent monitoring framework for the investigation of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) response to environmental stimuli. Mask R-CNN, a convolutional neural network architecture, was trained to automatically detect 3 object types in the environment: dolphins, people, and enrichment floats that were introduced to stimulate and engage the animals. Detected objects within each video frame were linked together to create track segments across frames. The animals’ tracks were used to parameterize their response to the presence of environmental stimuli. We collected and analyzed data from 24 sessions from bottlenose dolphins in a managed lagoon environment. The seasons had an average duration of 1 h and around half of them had enrichment (42%) while the rest (58%) did not. People were visible in the environment for 18.8% of the total time (∼4.5 h), more often when enrichment was present (∼3 h) than without (∼1.5 h). When neither enrichment nor people were present, the animals swam at an average speed of 1.2 m/s. When enrichment was added to the lagoon, average swimming speed decreased to 1.0 m/s and the animals spent more time moving at slow speeds around the enrichment. Animals’ engagement with the enrichment also decreased over time. These results indicate that the presence of enrichment and people in, or around, the environment attracts the animals, influencing habitat use and movement patterns as a result. This work demonstrates the ability of the proposed framework for the quantification and persistent monitoring of bottlenose dolphins’ movement, and will enable new studies to investigate individual and group animal locomotion and behavior. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Accurate identification of individual ages within wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) is critical for determining population health and the development of population management strategies. As such, we analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns by applying a custom methylation array (HorvathMammalMethyl40) to both blood (n = 140) and skin samples (n = 87) from known age or approximate age (0–57 years) bottlenose dolphins. We present three bottlenose dolphin specific age estimation clocks using combined blood and skin [48 CpGs, R = 0.93, median absolute error (MAE) = 2.13 years], blood only (64 CpGs, R = 0.97, error = 1.46 years) and skin only (39 CpGs, R = 0.95, error = 2.53). We characterized individual cytosines that correlate with sex and age in dolphins and developed a sex estimator based on 71 CpGs that predicts the sex of any odontocete species with 99.5% accuracy. The presented epigenetic clocks are expected to be useful for conservation efforts and for determining if anthropogenic events affect aging rates in wild populations. © Copyright © 2021 Robeck, Fei, Haghani, Zoller, Li, Steinman, Dirocco, Staggs, Schmitt, Osborn, Montano, Rodriguez and Horvath.

ABSTRACT: Cetacea is a clade well-adapted to the aquatic lifestyle, with diverse adaptations and physiological responses, as well as a robust antioxidant defense system. Serious injuries caused by boats and fishing nets are common in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus); however, these animals do not show signs of serious infections. Evidence suggests an adaptive response to tissue damage and associated infections in cetaceans. Heme oxygenase (HO) is a cytoprotective protein that participates in the anti-inflammatory response. HO catalyzes the first step in the oxidative degradation of the heme group. Various stimuli, including inflammatory mediators, regulate the inducible HO-1 isoform. This study aims to characterize HO-1 of the bottlenose dolphin in silico and compare its structure to the terrestrial mammal protein. Upstream HO-1 sequence of the bottlenose dolphin was obtained from NCBI and Ensemble databases, and the gene structure was determined using bioinformatics tools. Five exons and four introns were identified, and proximal regulatory elements were detected in the upstream region. The presence of 10 α-helices, three 310 helices, the heme group lodged between the proximal and distal helices, and a histidine-25 in the proximal helix serving as a ligand to the heme group were inferred for T. truncatus. Amino acid sequence alignment suggests HO-1 is a conserved protein. The HO-1 “fingerprint” and histidine-25 appear to be fully conserved among all species analyzed. Evidence of positive selection within an α-helix configuration without changes in protein configuration and evidence of purifying selection were found, indicating evolutionary conservation of the coding sequence structure. © Copyright © 2021 Reyes-Ramos, Gaxiola-Robles, Vázquez-Medina, Ramírez-Jirano, Bitzer-Quintero and Zenteno-Savín.

ABSTRACT: Mammalian sperm have long been known to use energy derived from the metabolism of sugars and fatty acids. A new study shows that sperm of dolphins and their relatives lost functionality of the glycolysis pathway and are fueled only by energy-rich fatty acids that are metabolized by extra-large mitochondria, giving them exceptional endurance. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Yawning is an involuntary action that begins with a slow opening of the mouth with inhalation, followed by a maximum gaping phase, and ends with a short exhalation and the closing of the mouth. A wide variety of vertebrate species, including humans, yawn. Here, we report underwater yawn-like behavior in three captive common bottlenose dolphins, inferred from 119-h of observations. Five cases of yawn-like behavior were selected out of 2045 open-mouth behaviors, after removing intentional open-mouth behaviors. Yawn-like behaviors were chosen that had a mouth open–close duration ratio of ≤ 1 (duration of Phase 3, the period of mouth closing after maximum opening, divided by the duration of Phase 1, the period of mouth opening from start to maximum opening). Naïve human evaluators selected “yawn-like” behaviors. All five cases of yawn-like behavior occurred during inactive periods, similar to human yawns. In three of the five cases, inactivity levels significantly decreased within 4 min after the yawn-like behavior; therefore, yawn-like behavior in dolphins may increase their arousal level in drowsy states. Thus, the yawn-like behavior of dolphins, without breathing, is similar to yawning in terrestrial animals, including humans. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is “endangered” with likely less than 500 animals remaining in South African waters. Established in 2016, the SouSA Consortium is a formalised network of scientists and conservationists to combine knowledge and research efforts, and make coordinated decisions with the aim of conserving the species. The first collaborative project collated available photo-identification data in an attempt to refine a national population estimate and investigate movements between research sites. This work was able to identify 250 uniquely marked individuals, with the population divided into the south-coast (Agulhas bioregion) and east-coast (Natal bioregion) populations. Environmental factors almost certainly play a role in the declining numbers of the species in South African waters. However, individual threats and solutions are challenging to identify as the South African marine environment is undergoing significant natural and anthropogenic changes with major shifts in the distribution and numbers of some prey, competitor and predator species. Therefore, we believe that a continued investigation of potential contributing factors and their interaction will take too long, inevitably resulting in another case of documenting extinction. With this in mind, we present the results of a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis in an effort to help us identify the next steps to take toward the conservation of humpback dolphins in South African waters. We unanimously conclude that no single cause for the rapid decline of humpback dolphins in South African waters can be identified, and that the cumulative effects of multiple stressors, which are difficult to pinpoint and mitigate, are impacting population numbers. While highlighting the need for continued research, we suggest a shift toward more action-focused conservation efforts, the first concrete steps being the development of a Conservation Management Plan with input from other stakeholders. © Copyright © 2021 Plön, Atkins, Cockcroft, Conry, Dines, Elwen, Gennari, Gopal, Gridley, Hörbst, James, Penry, Thornton, Vargas-Fonseca and Vermeulen.

ABSTRACT: Esophageal and pharyngeal obstruction are commonly reported in marine mammals, but asphyxiation from blowhole and nasal cavity obstruction has been reported only rarely: in two long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas), several harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and one common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). We describe two cases of blowhole obstruction and subsequent asphyxiation in bot-tlenose dolphins caused by eels. A whip eel (Bascanichthys scuticaris) was found obstructing the blowhole of a deceased dolphin from the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, US (2011) and a shrimp eel (Ophichthus gomesii) was found obstructing the blowhole of a deceased dolphin from Tampa Bay, Florida (2020). Normally, the respiratory and digestive tracts of cetaceans do not communicate. Consuming large or oddly shaped prey can result in laryngeal displacement and subsequent interaction between the two systems. It is likely the eels entered the oral cavity while the dolphins were consuming or playing with prey, and laryngeal displacement enabled the eels to slither into and become stuck in the nasal passage, causing asphyxiation. These novel findings underscore the importance of continued investigation into causes of mortality in stranded marine mammals and can contribute to the knowledge of feeding ecology in bottlenose dolphins. As changing environmental conditions contribute to shifts in prey availability and abundance, mortality due to prey-related asphyxiation could become more common in odonto-cetes. © Wildlife Disease Association 2021.

ABSTRACT: Many marine species exhibit fine-scale population structure despite high mobility and a lack of physical barriers to dispersal, but the evolutionary drivers of differentiation in these systems are generally poorly understood. Here we investigate the potential role of habitat transitions and seasonal prey distributions on the evolution of population structure in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus, off South Africa's coast, using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing. Population structure was identified between the eastern and southern coasts and correlated with the habitat transition between the temperate Agulhas (southern) and subtropical Natal (eastern) Bioregions, suggesting differentiation driven by resource specializations. Differentiation along the Natal coast was comparatively weak, but was evident in some analyses and varied depending on whether the samples were collected during or outside the seasonal sardine (Sardinops sagax) run. This local abundance of prey could influence the ranging patterns and apparent genetic structure of T. aduncus. These findings have significant and transferable management implications, most importantly in terms of differentiating populations inhabiting distinct bioregions and seasonal structural patterns within a region associated with the movement of prey resources. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In Shark Bay, Western Australia, male bottlenose dolphins form a complex nested alliance hierarchy. At the first level, pairs or trios of unrelated males cooperate to herd individual females. Multiple first-order alliances cooperate in teams (second-order alliances) in the pursuit and defence of females, and multiple teams also work together (third-order alliances). Yet it remains unknown how dolphins classify these nested alliance relationships. We use 30 years of behavioural data combined with 40 contemporary sound playback experiments to 14 allied males, recording responses with drone-mounted video and a hydrophone array. We show that males form a first-person social concept of cooperative team membership at the second-order alliance level, independently of first-order alliance history and current relationship strength across all three alliance levels. Such associative concepts develop through experience and likely played an important role in the cooperative behaviour of early humans. These results provide evidence that cooperation-based concepts are not unique to humans, occurring in other animal societies with extensive cooperation between non-kin. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Studies on the microbiota of freshwater cetaceans are scarce and may provide important data on animal and environmental health. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria recovered from two populations of free-ranging Amazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis). Twenty-one animals were captured and released, 13 from Negro River and 8 from Tapajós River, Brazil. Swab samples were obtained from the oral cavity, blowhole, genital opening and rectum and were cultured on MacConkey agar. Isolates were biochemically identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by disk diffusion method. Overall, 132 isolates were recovered, of which 71 were recovered from animals from Negro River and 61 from Tapajós River. The most commonly recovered bacterial species were Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, 51.6% (63/122) of the isolates were not-susceptible (intermediate resistance and resistance), of which 28/122 (22.9%) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Cephalothin, cefuroxime and cefepime were the drugs to which more resistant and intermediate results were observed (P < 0.001). The results indicate that free-ranging Amazon river dolphins host resistant bacteria, contributing for their maintenance in the environment. This study highlights the importance of the One Health approach to monitor the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Summary Gram-negative bacteria recovered from 21 free-ranging Amazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) from the Negro River and the Tapajós River populations were evaluated for their antimicrobial susceptibility. Overall, 51.6% (63/122) of the isolates were not-susceptible (intermediate resistance and resistance), of which 28/122 (22.9%) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Cephalothin, cefuroxime and cefepime were the drugs to which more resistant and intermediate results were observed. Thus, free-ranging Amazon river dolphins, never treated with antimicrobials, host resistant bacteria, contributing for their maintenance in the environment and highlighting the importance of the One Health approach to monitor the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. © 2021, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, a novel continuum robotic dolphin termed 'ConRoDolI' is proposed and developed. The biomimetic robot features dual tendon driving continuum mechanisms that are utilized to replicate the twisting and bending motions of the dolphin's caudal vertebrae and thoracic vertebrae. More importantly, a central pattern generator based kinematics is analyzed to yield stable dolphin-like swimming. In the meantime, the relationship between the backbone shape and both the tendon length as well as position and orientation are explored. Furthermore, multimodal swimming gaits are designed to pave the way for a three-dimensional (3D) swimming decoupling solution, involving forwarding swimming, multiple yaw patterns, and multiple pitch patterns. All of these endow the robotic dolphin with 3D maneuverability. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed biomimetic mechatronic design and control approach. The forward swimming speed is 0.44 body lengths per second (BL/s). The steering radius of the robot is about 0.11 BL with an angular velocity of 10°/s and the diving speed is about 0.13 BL/s. The average propulsion efficiency is about 0.6 with the maximum is over 0.8. The obtained results shed light on the improvement of aquatic maneuverability associated with new-concept underwater vehicles. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The small population paradigm assumes that populations with low numbers of individuals intrinsically have a high probability of extinction. The small population of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus gephyreus that specializes in foraging with artisanal fishers in Laguna, southern Brazil, faces human pressures including bycatch in fishing gear. The viability of this population was modelled over 30 and 100 years under different levels of bycatch, including the current scenario of two bycatches every year, two scenarios with higher incidence of bycatches and three management scenarios. The sensitivity of predicted growth rates to fixed-proportion and observed-variation changes in life history parameters was explored. The current scenario predicted a declining population (r = −0.014; λ = 0.986) with a high probability of extinction in the long term (PE = 0.71). A small increase in bycatches would result in a marked increase in the probability of extinction. Management scenarios seem promising, but only the zero-bycatch management scenario would make the difference between a declining and an increasing population. As expected for slow-growing species, population growth rate was most sensitive to proportional changes in adult female and juvenile survival. However, considering observed variation in vital rates, population dynamics were most influenced by variation in reproductive rates. To determine the highest priority for management action, another simulation was made of how additional threat scenarios of recognized human activities (i.e. bycatch influencing adult survival and increased underwater noise or pollution influencing calf survival) would affect population dynamics. Population growth rate was very sensitive to changes in adult bycatch (especially females), as expected, and only subtly sensitive to a reduction in calf survival. The current level of bycatch is unsustainable. Bycatch needs to be eliminated to maximize the probability of long-term persistence of this dolphin population. However, this population’s persistence could be threatened by natural variation in reproductive rates. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) is a significant aquatic pathogen of farmed fish species, important zoonotic pathogen, and reported cause of disease in captive Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) and a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Here we report S. iniae as the cause of subcutaneous abscesses, sepsis and mortality in a juvenile free-ranging short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) found deceased on a metropolitan Australian beach. Body surfaces were covered by multifocal, depressed, deep, irregular cutaneous ulcerations, which microscopically were characterised by ruptured subcutaneous abscesses with intralesional cocci. Routine microbiological investigations revealed a heavy growth of beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. identified as Streptococcus iniae in skin lesions as well as from heart blood, the latter supportive of sepsis. Tissues were negative for cetacean morbillivirus and no other disease processes were identified. S. iniae has not been reported in free-ranging marine mammals, nor in Australian delphinids, previously. More notably a pathogen of captive animals, this case report identifies S. iniae as a pathogen of wild dolphins also. In addition to expanding the host reservoir of a significant zoonotic pathogen, determining the source of infection as well as possible consequences for other marine mammals and wild and intensive fish stocks warrants further investigations. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins’ whistles are strongly diversified mainly related to physiology and behaviour. We present the whistle characteristics and intraspecific variations of short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis of the Western South Atlantic Ocean (WSAO). A total of 1630 whistles from six encounters were analysed considering group size, contours and acoustical parameters. No significant correlation was found (p > 0.05) between number of whistles and the group size. Upsweep, downsweep and constant were the most frequent contours. A positive relation between the downsweep contour and group size was detected (p < 0.05). Minimum, maximum, centre, peak, initial and final frequencies, frequency range, frequency gradient, duration and inflection points were extracted. The frequencies ranged from 1.34 to 35.23 kHz and the duration varied from 0.11 to 2.16 seconds. Comparing encounters between years through Bonferroni method, minimum frequency, duration, and frequency range were significantly different. C5.0 decision tree showed that whistles of 2014 and 2015 had correct classifications (67.0% and 54.0%, respectively). The nMDS grouped the Atlantic and Pacific oceans based on inflection points and duration, further corroborated through PERMANOVA (p < 0.05). Our results suggest the influence of certain parameters related to intraspecific variation. Whistles comparison with other localities corroborates with differences in geographical scale. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The presence of transient and temporary individuals in capture-mark-recapture studies may violate the assumption on equal catchability, and thus yield biased estimates. We investigated the effects of residency patterns on population parameters of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the coastal waters off the Alvarado Lagoon System (ALS), Veracruz, Mexico. We hypothesized that this population is open but there exists a “core community” that behaves as a closed population. Between 2006 and 2010, we conducted 75 photo-identification surveys and recorded 263 dolphin group encounters, in which 231 dolphins were identified. Individuals present during only one season, classified as transients (n = 85), were excluded from the study, and a standardized residency index (IH4) was computed for each dolphin that remained in the sample (n = 146). We used the K-means clustering method to split the sample into groups based on individual (seasonal, annual) IH4 values. These clusters were named as regular residents (RR, n = 55), occasional residents (OR, n = 45), and occasional visitors (OV, n = 46). The cumulative frequency of newly identified individuals displayed an asymptotic trend for the whole sample and all clusters, indicating that most of the individuals present in the study area during the study period were identified. The assumption of demographic closure was tested to define the core community, and was rejected for the whole sample and the OV cluster (p < 0.001 in both cases), indicating that the population is open. The closure assumption was not rejected for RR and OR clusters (χ2 = 6.88, DF = 13, p = 0.91, and χ2 = 17.8, DF = 16, p = 0.33, respectively), indicating that these clusters were demographically closed over the 5-year period. Thus, we defined this aggregation of individuals as the “core community”. The closed population model Mth indicated that the total abundance of this core community was 123 individuals (95% CI: 114–133). Our results provide quantitative evidence of the existence of a core community in open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and points toward residency pattern as a main driver of population dynamics. These results highlight the importance of considering residency patterns when dealing with heterogeneity in the sample of a highly mobile species.

ABSTRACT: From midnight of 26 March 2020, New Zealand became one of the first countries to enter a strict lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown banned all non-essential services and travel both on land and sea. Overnight, the country's busiest coastal waterway, the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, became devoid of almost all recreational and non-essential commercial vessels. An almost instant change in the marine soundscape ensued, with ambient sound levels in busy channels dropping nearly threefold the first 12 h. This sudden drop led fish and dolphins to experience an immediate increase in their communication ranges by up to an estimated 65%. Very low vessel activity during the lockdown (indicated by the presence of vessel noise over the day) revealed new insights into cumulative noise effects from vessels on auditory masking. For example, at sites nearer Auckland City, communication ranges increased approximately 18 m (22%) or 50 m (11%) for every 10% decrease in vessel activity for fish and dolphins, respectively. However, further from the city and in deeper water, these communication ranges were increased by approximately 13 m (31%) or 510 m (20%). These new data demonstrate how noise from small vessels can impact underwater soundscapes and how marine animals will have to adapt to ever-growing noise pollution. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Proteins play an important role in many reproductive functions such as sperm maturation, sperm transit in the female genital tract or sperm-oocyte interaction. However, in general, little information concerning reproductive features is available in the case of aquatic animals. The present study aims to characterize the proteome of both spermatozoa and seminal plasma of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) as a model organism for cetaceans. Ejaculate samples were obtained from two trained dolphins housed in an aquarium. Spermatozoa and seminal plasma were analyzed by means of proteomic analyses using an LC-MS/MS, and a list with the gene symbols corresponding to each protein was submitted to the DAVID database. Of the 419 proteins identified in spermatozoa and 303 in seminal plasma, 111 proteins were shared by both. Furthermore, 70 proteins were identified as involved in reproductive processes, 39 in spermatozoa, and 31 in seminal plasma. The five most abundant proteins were also identified in these samples: AKAP3, ODF2, TUBB, GSTM3, ROPN1 for spermatozoa and CST11, LTF, ALB, HSP90B1, PIGR for seminal plasma. In conclusion, this study provides the first characterization of the proteome in cetacean sperm and seminal plasma, opening the way to future research into new biomarkers, the analysis of conservation capacity or possible additional applications in the field of assisted reproductive technologies. © Copyright © 2021 Fuentes-Albero, González-Brusi, Cots, Luongo, Abril-Sánchez, Ros-Santaella, Pintus, Ruiz-Díaz, Barros-García, Sánchez-Calabuig, García-Párraga, Avilés, Izquierdo Rico and García-Vázquez.

ABSTRACT: The niche describes the ecological and social environment that an organism lives in, as well as the behavioural tactics used to interact with its environment. A species niche is key to both ecological and evolutionary processes, including speciation, and has therefore been a central focus in ecology. Recent evidence, however, points to considerable individual variation in a species' or population's niche use, although how this variation evolves or is maintained remains unclear. We used a large longitudinal dataset to investigate the drivers and maintenance of individual variation in bottlenose dolphins' Tursiops aduncus niche. Specifically, we (a) characterised the extent of individual differences in habitat use, (b) identified whether there were maternal effects associated with this variation and (c) investigated the relationship between habitat use and calving success, a component of reproductive fitness. By examining patterns of habitat use, we provide evidence that individual dolphins vary consistently between one another in their niche. We further show that such individual variation is driven by a strong maternal effect. Finally, habitat use and calving success were not related, suggesting that use of different habitats results in similar fitness outcomes. Niche partitioning, maintained by maternal effects, likely facilitates the coexistence of multiple ecotypes within this population. © 2021 British Ecological Society

ABSTRACT: We need reliable information about the spatial and temporal distribution of mobile species to effectively manage anthropogenic impacts to which they are exposed. Yet, we often cannot sustain dedicated annual surveys and data obtained from platforms of opportunity offer an alternative avenue to understand where these species spend time. Four odontocete species that occur in the four-island region of Maui, Hawai'i, USA, are vulnerable to a range of human activities, but there is a lack of information regarding their distribution. We therefore do not know the extent of the risk these activities present for the conservation of these species (bottlenose dolphins, spinner dolphins, Pantropical spotted dolphins and false killer whales). We used a cross-validated maximum entropy (MaxEnt) occupancy model to estimate the distribution of these four species in an area extensively observed from platforms of opportunity (PoP). We then determined in a similar fashion whether the calves of those species were more likely to be observed in particular areas and whether distribution changed with season. Maxent models relying on local environmental variables described dolphin observations well (AUC > 0.7). Their distribution differed for all species when calves were present, indicating that different environmental variables describe area use for schools with calves present. The number of sighting events of all species varied significantly with season. Bottlenose dolphins and false killer whales were more prevalent in winter, while spotted and spinner dolphins were more prevalent in summer. We show that an overlap in the distribution of dolphin schools with calves and vessel traffic in the region could result in collision and chronic stress risks. This suggests a need for specific regulations for mitigating anthropogenic influences, such as acoustic disturbance or chronic energetic disturbance from vessel traffic. This elevated risk associated with vessel traffic is likely of conservation concern in this region for the endangered population of false killer whales and for spinner dolphins. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: With a remarkable exception for the Mediterranean, the worldwide Pliocene record of true dolphins (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Delphinidae) remains scarce, in stark contrast with the large number of extant species testifying to the evolutionary success of this family. Based on a fragmentary skull discovered in lower Pliocene deposits (Zanclean, 5 to 4.4 Ma) of the Kattendijk Formation in the Antwerp harbour (Belgium, southern margin of the North Sea basin), we describe here a new delphinid species, Pliodelphis doelensis gen. et sp. nov. This small dolphin with cranial dimensions in the range of the short-beaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis can be distinguished from other extinct and extant delphinids by a combination of cranial features including the maxilla being significantly narrower than the premaxilla at a short distance anterior to the antorbital notch in dorsal view, the maximum opening of the mesorostral groove being located at the level of the antorbital notches, a transversely wide and anteroposteriorly long dorsal exposure of the presphenoid anterior to the bony nares, and all dorsal infraorbital foramina being located posterior to the premaxillary foramina. P. doelensis constitutes the first member of the family described from the early Pliocene of the North Sea basin and, for the whole North Atlantic realm, only the third outside the Mediterranean. This new record contributes thus to our understanding of the poorly known Pliocene radiation(s) of true dolphins. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the genomic basis of adaptation is critical for understanding evolutionary processes and predicting how species will respond to environmental change. Spinner dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) present a unique system for studying adaptation. Within this large geographical region are four spinner dolphin ecotypes with weak neutral genetic divergence and no obvious barriers to gene flow, but strong spatial variation in morphology, behaviour and habitat. These ecotypes have large population sizes, which could reduce the effects of drift and facilitate selection. To identify genomic regions putatively under divergent selective pressures between ecotypes, we used genome scans with 8994 RADseq single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify population differentiation outliers and genotype–environment association outliers. Gene ontology enrichment analyses indicated that outlier SNPs from both types of analyses were associated with multiple genes involved in social behaviour and hippocampus development, including 15 genes associated with the human social disorder autism. Evidence for divergent selection on social behaviour is supported by previous evidence that these spinner dolphin ecotypes differ in mating systems and associated social behaviours. In particular, three of the ETP ecotypes probably have a polygynous mating system characterized by strong premating competition among males, whereas the fourth ecotype probably has a polygynandrous mating system characterized by strong postmating competition such as sperm competition. Our results provide evidence that selection for social behaviour may be an evolutionary force driving diversification of spinner dolphins in the ETP, potentially as a result of divergent sexual selection associated with different mating systems. Future studies should further investigate the potential adaptive role of the candidate genes identified here, and could probably find further signatures of selection using whole genome sequence data. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Fishing activities continue to decimate populations of marine mammals, fish, and their habitats in the coastal waters of the Kep Archipelago, a cluster of tropical islands on the Cambodia-Vietnam border. In 2019, the area was recognized as an Important Marine Mammal Area, largely owing to the significant presence of Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris). Understanding habitat preferences and distribution aids in the identification of areas to target for monitoring and conservation, which is particularly challenging in data-limited nations of Southeast Asia. Here, we test the hypothesis that accurate seasonal habitat models, relying on environmental data and species occurrences alone, can be used to describe the ecological processes governing abundance for the resident dolphin population of the Kep Archipelago, Cambodia. Leveraging two years of species and oceanographic data—depth, slope, distance to shore and rivers, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a concentration—we built temporally stratified models to estimate distribution and infer seasonal habitat importance. Overall, Irrawaddy dolphins of Kep displayed habitat preferences similar to other populations, and were predominately encountered in three situations: (1) water depths ranging from 3.0 to 5.3 m, (2) surface water temperatures of 27–32°C, and (3) in close proximity to offshore islands (< 7.5 km). With respect to seasonality, statistical tests detected significant differences for all environment variables considered except seafloor slope. Four predictor sets, each with a unique combination of variables, were used to map seasonal variation in dolphin habitat suitability. Models with highest variable importance scores were water depth, pre- and during monsoon season (61–62%), and sea surface temperature, post-monsoon (71%), which suggests that greater freshwater flow during the wet season may alter primary productivity and dolphin prey abundance. Importantly, findings show the majority of areas with highest habitat suitability are not currently surveyed for dolphins and located outside Kep’s Marine Fisheries Management Area. This research confirms the need to expand monitoring to new areas where high-impact fisheries and other human activities operate. Baseline knowledge on dolphin distribution can guide regional conservation efforts by taking into account the seasonality of the species and support the design of tailored management strategies that address transboundary threats to an Important Marine Mammal Area. © Copyright © 2021 Verutes, Tubbs, Selmes, Clark, Walker and Clements.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive hormones in serum concentrations of progesterone, estradiol, and testosterone in female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus, n = 12) housed in Ocean Park Hong Kong were investigated in the present study. Results showed that, onset of puberty of captive Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins was at 5 years while sexual maturity was at 6. Average serum progesterone concentrations in non-pregnant sexually mature individuals was 0.33 (0.25–0.97) ng/mL (interquartile), significantly higher than in immature ones 0.26 (0.25–0.38) ng/mL. This study found significant difference in serum estradiol concentrations between individuals at the onset of puberty (9.5 ± 1.7 pg/mL, ±SD) and not (below detection limit 9 pg/mL). A slightly seasonal breeding pattern, with progesterone values tend to be higher from February to October (0.38 [0.25–1.07] ng/mL) was inferred. During pregnancy, serum progesterone concentrations range from 10.54 ± 8.74 ng/mL (indexed month post-conception [IMPC] 0) to 25.49 ± 12.06 ng/mL (IMPC 2), and display a bimodal pattern with 2 peaks in early- (25.49 ± 12.06 ng/mL, IMPC 2) and late-pregnancy (21.71 ± 10.25 ng/mL, IMPC 12), respectively. Serum estradiol concentrations can seldom be detected in early-pregnancy and increase constantly in mid- (9.45 ± 1.83 pg/mL) and late-pregnancy (11.88 ± 3.81 pg/mL), with a spike (15.45 ± 6.78 pg/mL) 1 month prior to delivery. Serum testosterone concentrations elevate significantly in IMPC 7 (0.36 ± 0.10 ng/mL) compared to other months (0.16 ± 0.10 ng/mL) of the year. The present study provides normal concentration profiles for some reproductive hormones in female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and can contribute to the breeding monitoring of this species. Also, our study would shed further light on the reproductive physiology of small cetaceans. © 2020 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The underwater soundscape is an important ecological element affecting numerous aquatic animals, in particular dolphins, which must identify salient cues from ambient ocean noise. In this study, temporal variations in the soundscape of Jiaotou Bay were monitored from February 2016 to January 2017, where a population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) has recently been a regular sighting. An autonomous acoustic recorder was deployed in shallow waters, and 1/3-octave band sound pressure levels (SPLs) were calculated with central frequencies ranging from 25 Hz to 40 kHz, then were grouped into 3 subdivided bands via cluster analysis. SPLs at each major band showed significant differences on a diel, fishing-related period, seasonal, and tidal phase scale. Anthropogenic noise generated by passing ships and underwater explosions were recorded in the study area. The fish and dolphin acoustic activities both exhibited diel and seasonal variations, but no tidal cycle patterns. A negative significant relationship between anthropogenic sound detection rates and dolphin detection rates were observed, and fish detection rates showed no effect on dolphin detection rates, indicating anthropogenic activity avoidance and no forced foraging in dolphins in the study area. The results provide fundamental insight into the acoustic dynamics of an important Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin habitat within a coastal area affected by a rapid increase in human activity, and demonstrate the need to protect animal habitat from anthropogenic noises. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The coastal habit and site fidelity reported for Sotalia guianensis make this species especially vulnerable to human activities. Thus, ecological studies focusing on the habitat use of the populations are essential for S. guianensis protection, as it helps to identify critical areas for conservation. The present study aims to analyze the habitat use by Sotalia guianensis in three bays in southeastern Brazil: Guanabara Bay (GB1), Sepetiba Bay (SB2) and Ilha Grande Bay (IGB3). From 2017 to 2019, four surveys per month were carried out in each bay on board of outboard-powered boats. After locating a group of dolphins, researchers recorded data every five minutes, applying the focal-group method. Information collected included geographical position, time of day, group size and composition, predominant behavioral state, and local depth in meters. The ArcGIS software was selected to create distribution maps and estimate the area use using the fixed Kernel Density method (KDE). The variables collected were statistically compared within and between populations. Feeding was the predominant behavior (frequency of 84.2% in GB, 73.3% in SB and 52.2% in IGB), but behavior frequencies differed between populations (X2=57.622, df=2, p < 0.00001). Group size and composition also varied according to the study area (KWsize: H2,732=68.479, p < 0.0001; KWcomposition: H2,732=85.311, p < 0.001), IGB and SB showing large aggregations with many calves and GB, small groups. In GB, dolphin distribution was restricted to shallow waters of the northeastern region and central channel (K95% = 9.9 km2; K50% = 1.2 km2). Guiana dolphins from SB selected greater depths, concentrating in the central region (K95% = 190.6 km2; K50% = 32.6 km2). In IGB, dolphins occurred in an extensive area (K95% = 264.9 km2; K50% = 42.5 km2), though observed more frequently in shallow waters of the western region. The results described can contribute to a better knowledge of the populations and serve as a basis for conservation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) reside in shallow coastal waters where they are exposed to potentially toxic elements (PTEs) through dietary intake. We quantitatively assessed the risk posed by eight PTEs to the health of S. chinensis by determining their concentration in 13 fish species. The fish species represented the primary prey of S. chinensis in the South China Sea. Zn and Mn were the most dominant elements in fish at all sampling locations with concentrations ranges of 19.93–67.63 mg kg −1 dry weight (dw) and 1.52–68.2 mg kg −1 dw, respectively. The highest Zn concentration in fish was found in Coilia mystus (72.65 mg kg−1 dw) followed by Liza carinatus (62.57 mg kg−1 dw). At Jiangmen, Zn concentration was significantly lower in benthopelagic fish than in pelagic fish (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA), while no significant difference was observed in other metals. The health risk posed by dietary intake assessed using the toxicity reference value showed that PTEs did not significant health risk to S. chinensis. In contrast, the risk quotient (RQ) based on reference doses ranged from 2.17 to 54.63 in prey fish that were contaminated with Zn and Cr indicating a potential health risk to S. chinensis in the South China Sea. The number of PTEs that posed a health risk varied between sites with seven out of eight PTEs above threshold at Jiangmen and six out of eight at Zhanjiang and Qinzhou. This study showed fish niche and location may influence the health risk posed by consumption of PTE-contaminated fish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) are highly social odontocetes with a poorly understood tendency to mass strand. With limited capacity to study social ecology in the open ocean, mass strandings provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of group structure. Our study of 32 mass stranding events that occurred on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, between 1999 and 2009 identifies aspects of social ecology that vary across the year. A greater number of mass stranding events occurred outside of the breeding season and there was evidence of age-structuring during the breeding season. We find generally low average intragroup pairwise relatedness assessed across eight microsatellite loci in a subset of 16 mass stranding events. Mass stranded groups do not show higher than expected relatedness when compared to a baseline estimate derived from single-stranded individuals. Overall, our integration of genetic estimates of relatedness with data on sex and maturity-class from stranded specimens suggests that Atlantic white-sided dolphins fall near the more fluid end of the continuum from short-term, highly fluid social associations to long-term, stable groups represented among the odontocetes. Despite their tendency to mass strand, stable, kin-based associations are not a defining feature of social group structure in this species. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have previously demonstrated exposure to phthalate esters. Phthalates and phthalate esters are commonly added to consumer goods to enhance desirable properties. As the amount of plastic marine debris increases, these chemicals can easily leach from these products into the surrounding environment. To evaluate demographic variability in exposure, eight phthalate metabolites were quantified in urine samples collected from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins sampled in Sarasota Bay, FL, USA (2010–2019; n = 51). Approximately 75% of individual dolphins had detectable concentrations of at least one phthalate metabolite. The most frequently detected metabolites were mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP; n = 28; GM = 4.57 ng/mL; 95% CI = 2.37–8.80; KM mean = 7.95; s.d. = 15.88) and monoethyl phthalate (MEP; GM = 4.51 ng/mL; 95% CI = 2.77–7.34; ROS mean = 2.24; s.d. = 5.58). Urinary concentrations of MEHP and MEP were not significantly different between sex (MEHP p = 0.09; MEP p = 0.22) or age class (i.e., calf/juvenile vs. adult; MEHP p = 0.67; MEP p = 0.13). Additionally, there were no significant group differences in the likelihood of MEHP or MEP detection for any demographic as determined by a Peto-Peto test. Frequency of detection was similar for both metabolites between males and females (MEHP p = 0.10; MEP p = 0.40) as well as between juveniles and adults (MEHP p = 0.50; MEP: p = 0.60). These findings suggest ubiquitous exposure risk for both sexes and age classes, warranting further investigation into potential sources and health implications. © 2021. The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The distribution of cetaceans is generally studied on the basis of their visual locations. However, the absence of observations does not exclude the presence of dolphins and not allow to distinguish habitats favourable to the species but where it would be currently absent due to anthropic disturbances. The modelling of ecological niches represents a powerful alternative choice and intensive computer modelling has been increasingly used to reveal the complexity of the relationships between cetaceans and their habitat. Here, we predicted the presence/absence of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), an endangered species, using the artificial neural network model of back-propagation (BP-ANN) with eight environmental variables. The BP-ANN model had a higher success rate for correct prediction (74%) compared to linear discriminant analysis (67%), especially for the prediction of the presence of S. chinensis (63% to 31%), indicating its potential application in cetacean habitat research. In the model output map, three suitable habitats were predicted without S. chinensis sightings identified. However, only one was confirmed by subsequent field surveys, the other two being located in a strong shipping area. Therefore, we suggest that the traditional assessment of the baseline habitat based on visual sighting may miss the identification of some suitable habitats due to anthropogenic disturbance. We have also highlighted the importance of ecological modelling research for cetacean conservation. In addition, among the eight environmental variables studied, distance from shore, fish abundance and salinity proved to be the most important factors for the distribution of S. chinensis, indicating that coastal construction, sea recovery and overfishing would be key constraints for its conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This study presents data on a local population of short-beaked common dolphin monitored in the waters off Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples, Italy) over a 16-year period (2000-2015). We examine dolphin occurrence and distribution and perform photoidentification analysis. The data presented support the hypothesis that the waters around Ischia Island represent a feeding area, as well as a calving and an important nursery area for this local population, providing favourable conditions in which to give birth and raise calves. The levelling-off of the photoidentification curves together with the continuous decline of the encounter rate lead us to believe that the area has been a hotspot for a local population (mainly resident) for years and that now this population is dying (has died) or is moving (has moved) to other locations. Several expanding human activities at sea have the potential to impact on the common dolphin in the study area, the most significant possibly being habitat disturbance and degradation (including traffic and noise pollution) and overexploitation of food resources by the fishery. The data presented in this study offer a strong argument for explicit and urgent population-specific conservation and management strategies to be developed and applied locally for common dolphins, considering that they rely on the region for important biological processes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have been bred under human care for more than 60 years. Calves up to 30 days of life have presented the highest mortality rate, although comparable data for free-ranging neonates within this age group is not available. Husbandry measures to increase survivability have therefore been constantly improved. This work shows the results of a structured veterinary program that established the procedures to collect relevant physiological parameters on 13 calves during their first 30 days of life. Standardized observation protocols facilitated statistical analysis of the respiratory pattern, nursing, morphometric measurements and bloodwork. These allow early detection of health issues. Healthy neonates had longer apnea duration, despite the shape and size of the facility. The nursing pattern showed that successful calves started nursing 3 to 18 h postpartum. Although with different individual patterns, a steady increase in suckling time occurs during the first 24 h of life. The healthy neonates grew 0.428 ± 0.102 kg per day and the complete blood count profile, glucose, iron, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total protein, Alanine ami-notransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), cre-atinine and electrolytes values considered normal for healthy calves are provided. Furthermore, cholesterol, triglycerides, α-amylase, lipase, magnesium and cortisol are reported for the first time for such young calves. A list of indications for prompt intervention is included. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The short-beaked common dolphin is a highly vocal species, with a wide distribution in all oceans, including the Mediterranean and the Black Seas. In the Mediterranean Sea, the short-beaked common dolphin inhabits both pelagic and neritic waters. Osteological collections and the literature show that short-beaked common dolphins were widespread and abundant in much of the Mediterranean Sea until the late 1960s. During recent decades the species has declined in the whole basin, and, in 2003, it was listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List. Genetic studies strongly suggest that the Mediterranean and the Eastern North Atlantic populations are isolated from each other. Genetic differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea, between the Eastern Mediterranean (Ionian Sea) and Western Mediterranean populations, is also reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the geographical variation in the characteristics of whistles of free-ranging short-beaked common dolphins living in the Mediterranean Sea, and to evaluate if whistle acoustic structure is the result of adaptation to local environment characteristics or of a possible genetic diversification. Recordings were collected from 1994 to 2012 throughout the basin, employing multiple platforms. Twenty-six independent acoustic detections were made, and 704 whistles were extracted and considered for statistical analysis. Whistle analysis enabled the identification of distinct geographical units of short-beaked common dolphin within the Mediterranean Sea. Genetic isolation is probably the major cause of the geographic variance of the Mediterranean short-beaked common dolphin whistle structure, which may reflect some evolutionary adaptations to particular ecological conditions or may be the by-product of morphological evolution. The results of the present study show that intra-Mediterranean variability of whistle structure reflects the path of genetic studies, highlighting the possible use of acoustic data in combination with other sources of data (genetic, morphological, etc.) to identify geographic areas where discrete management units occur. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Captive mammals respond emotionally toward cognitive challenges, but research has precluded marine mammals. A potential indicator of emotion in toothed cetaceans is a large singular bubble (‘burst’) emitted from the blowhole, previously linked to surprise and excitement. Our study analysed bursts from a published study on dolphin cognitive enrichment. Bursts were only produced by task-engaged (72%) or task-spectating (28%) dolphins (n = 6 males in total). Burst frequency increased with the proportion of task engagement and spectator frequency, but not task progress or success (providing no evidence for an instantaneous ‘Eureka moment’). Bursts were reduced in frequency over three weeks, consistent with a decrease in task-engagement. Bursts were significantly more likely to come at the start of a bout of task-engagement than in the middle or end. We suggest bursts were an emotional response signaling dolphins’ instantaneous judgement of the task, more likely related to positive affect (interest, curiosity) than negative affect (frustration). They appear unrelated to respiration. It was unclear whether bursts were produced consciously and had a social function. We call for further dedicated research on the emotional valence of cetacean bursts. This will require simultaneous behavioural and acoustic measurements under different levels of more controlled challenge. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Zoos and aquaria must provide optimal husbandry conditions and the highest welfare standards for their animals. How the welfare state of an animal or a group of animals can be precisely assessed is currently under debate, and new approaches are necessary to reliably evaluate changes in welfare. One particular measure that is easily applicable is behavioral observations. However, for dolphins and other cetaceans under human care, reliable behavior-based measures are rare. Using long-term observations of a group of bottlenose dolphins, we investigate how their activity budgets and different behaviors changed over time and are impacted by construction noise. Additionally, we investigate whether behavioral differences are also reflected in changes in the dolphins’ performance during daily training sessions. Our results show that construction noise significantly alters the dolphins’ behavior. Play behavior decreases during construction periods; most importantly, the frequency of fast swimming activities significantly increased, and at the same time, a decrease in training performance is found. Additionally, inter-and intraindividual behavioral differences are attributed to factors, such as age or weaning. Significant changes in a dolphin’s activity budget can also pose potential welfare concerns. Thus, this study highlights the importance of regularly assessing and analyzing the behavior of dolphins under human care. Behavioral observations are essential welfare indicators and can—when complemented with other measures, such as assessment of training performance—provide zoo staff with important information about each individual’s state of welfare. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: By-catch is the primary global conservation threat to populations of dolphins and porpoises. Despite protection for these protected species under its Habitats Directive, the European Union (EU) has failed to adequately assess and, where necessary, mitigate the by-catch of small cetaceans. Management authority is diffuse, and the EU has no over-arching, quantitative conservation objectives. To address this, we recommend that the EU adopt a comprehensive plan to conserve dolphins and porpoises in European waters. This plan should include regular formal assessments of small cetacean populations, including establishment of quantitative management objectives, generation of estimates of abundance and by-catch mortality, and agreement on biological reference points that will guide management actions to ensure that by-catch does not exceed sustainable levels. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustics has been used extensively to study bottlenose dolphins; yet very few studies have examined the spatial, temporal, and environmental influences on vocalization types (echolocation, burst pulse sounds, and whistles), and few are long-term and provide high temporal resolution over multiple years. We used data from 2013 to 2018 to establish baseline acoustic patterns for bottlenose dolphins in the May River estuary, South Carolina. We deployed acoustic recorders at six stations during 2013–2014 and three stations during 2015–2018, with locations spanning the entire estuary (headwaters to the mouth). We discovered that acoustic detection of dolphins varied not only spatially, but also yearly, monthly, and tidally. Higher numbers of echolocation bouts, burst pulse sounds, and whistles were detected at the mouth as compared to the headwaters. At the mouth, vocalization detections were greatest in fall and winter for multiple years, and echolocation detection was greatest during falling and low tides. This study provides an example of another tool, long-term passive acoustics monitoring, to better understand spatial and temporal distribution of dolphins in a typical salt marsh estuary, that can be applied to other ecosystems throughout the southeastern United States and globally. © 2021 Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: In a wide variety of habitats, including some heavily urbanised areas, the adaptability of populations of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) may depend on the social structure dynamics. Nonetheless, the way in which these adaptations take place is still poorly understood. In the present study we applied photo-identification techniques to investigate the social structure of the common bottlenose dolphin population inhabiting the Gulf of Alghero (Sardinia, Italy), analysing data recorded from 2008 to 2019. The social structure analysis showed a division of the entire population into five different communities and the presence of non-random associations, while there was no evidence of segregation between sexes. Furthermore, results highlighted an important change in social structure through time, likely due to a reduction in fish farm activity since 2015. The division of the population into different communities, the presence of segregation based on the foraging strategy (inside or outside the fish farm area) and the social network measures were evaluated by analysing independently the two datasets: The intense and low farm activity periods: 2008-2014 and 2015-2020, respectively. Segregation among individuals belonging to the same foraging strategy class was found only in the earlier period, and the composition of the four communities was consistent with this result. Our study improves the knowledge about bottlenose dolphin adaptation, as a lower complexity in social structure was linked to a reduction in anthropogenic food availability.  © 2021 Frau et al.

ABSTRACT: The rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) is a poorly known species along its distribution especially in the Southern Hemisphere where data on habitat use and population parameters are scarce. Boat-based surveys were conducted from 2009 to 2017 in a shallow water environment in southeastern Brazil. During focal-group observations, S. bredanensis was more commonly found in mean depths of 22 m with varying group size and composition. Generalized additive models showed that group size was influenced by environmental variables such as sea surface and bottom temperatures, depth, and season. Photo-identification effort allowed us to catalogue 173 well-distinct marked individuals. Estimates of population parameters showed high and constant survival (Φ = 0.99) corroborating site fidelity but time varying capture probabilities (p =.03–.71). An open population model also indicated a small abundance estimate (Nt = 218) of S. bredanensis in the study area, improving knowledge for this species in shallow water environments of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Compared with other mammals, the digestive system of cetaceans presents some remarkable anatomical and physiological differences. However, the neurochemical features of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in these animals have only been described in part. The present study gives a description of the nitrergic and selected peptidergic systems in the myenteric plexus (MP) and submucosal plexus (SMP) of the intestine of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). The distribution and morphology of neurons immunoreactive (IR) for the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and Substance P (SP) were immunohistochemically studied in formalin-fixed specimens from the healthy intestine of three animals, and the data were compared with those described in the literature on other mammals (human and non-human). In bottlenose dolphins, the percentages of nitrergic neurons (expressed as median and interquartile range—IQR) were 28% (IQR = 19–29) in the MP and 1% (IQR = 0–2) in the SMP, while the percentages of SP-IR neurons were 31% (IQR = 22–37) in the MP and 41% (IQR = 24–63) in the SMP. Although morphological features of nNOS-and SP-IR neurons were similar to those reported in other mammals, we found some noticeable differences in the percentages of enteric neurons. In fact, we detected a lower proportion of nNOS-IR neurons in the SMP and a higher proportion of SP-IR neurons in the MP compared to other mammals. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study represents the first description and quantification of nNOS-IR neurons and the first quantification of SP-IR neurons in the intestine of a cetacean species. As nNOS and SP are important mediators of intestinal functions and the nitrergic population is an important target for many neuroenteropathies, data obtained from a healthy intestine provide a necessary basis to further investigate and understand possible functional differences and motor intestinal dysfunctions/alterations in these special mammals. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals stranding data provide valuable information on causes of mortality for cetacean populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the stranding events of common dolphins along the Algerian west coast, and estimate the proportion of human vs. non-human induced mortality of the population. Between 2008 and 2012, out of the 52 cetacean stranding records along the Algerian west coast, common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were recorded in 14 cases. All recorded strandings were of individual cases with no mass strandings registered during the reported period. To examine the proportion of human and non-human induced mortality affecting this population, necropsies were conducted. In 10 cases, an interaction with some type of fishing gear had occurred; in three, there was no link with human activity; and in one case, it was not possible to determine the cause of death due to the condition of the carcass (severely decomposed). © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Group size is a key social trait influencing population dynamics of group-living animals. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (IPHDs), Sousa chinensis, a shallow water delphinid species, display a fission-fusion social system. Yet little is known about how social organization of this species vary with temporal scales and behavioral state. In this study, we sampled group size estimates from the world’s second largest population of humpback dolphins (Sousa spp.), which inhabit the eastern waters of Zhanjiang, China. IPHD group sizes changed seasonally and inter-annually, but not with tidal phases. Group sizes also changed with behavioral state of IPHD groups and with number of mother-calf pairs present. IPHDs formed larger groups in the autumn than in other seasons, which might be related to seasonal changes in food availability and reproductive cycle. Of the groups observed, we recorded the presence of mother-calf pair in 85 groups (i.e., nursery groups: 47 ones with one pair, 25 ones with two pairs, and others with three pairs). Notably, nursery groups were about 2–4 times larger than non-nursery groups. In addition, group sizes greatly increased with the number of mother-calf pairs. Living in relatively large groups, more protection, food, and resources might be available for IPHD mothers and calves, and such social strategy provide higher reproduction efficiency and survival success for this species. During our observations, feeding (45.5%) and traveling (25.2%) represented the majority of IPHD’s behavioral budget, while socializing (8.4%) and resting/milling (6.8%) were not frequently observed. Resting/milling groups were approximately 50% smaller than feeding, traveling, or socializing groups, while the latter three types had a similar mean group size. Large groups when IPHDs foraged, traveled, or socialized, might provide more added group benefits. For the first time, our findings clearly revealed intra-population variability in IPHD group sizes across different behavioral and temporal variables, and provided a better understanding of IPHDs’ adaptations to various biological processes and ecological constraints. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Lin, Lusseau and Li.

ABSTRACT: Echolocation clicks can reflect the anatomy of the vocalizing animal, enabling the distinction of species. River dolphins from the family Iniidae are formally represented by one species and two subspecies (Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis and I. g. humboldtiana). Additionally, two other species have been proposed (I. boliviensis and I. araguaiaensis) regarding its level of restricted distribution and morph-genetics differences. For the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy, the specific status of the proposed species relies on further knowledge on morphology, ecology, and genetics. Given that species-specific status is required for conservation efforts, we described and compared the echolocation clicks of Inia spp., searching for specific differences on their vocalizations. The sounds were captured with a Cetacean Research TM C54XRS (+3/−20 dB, −185 dB re: 1V/mPa) in Guaviare River (Orinoco basin), Madeira River (Madeira basin), Xingu River (Amazon Basin), and Araguaia River (Tocantins-Araguaia basin). We found significant differences in all analyzed parameters (peak frequency, 3 dB bandwidth, 10 dB bandwidth and inter-click interval) for all species and subspecies. Differences in acoustical parameters of clicks are mainly related to the animal’s internal morphology, thus this study may potentially support with information for the species-level classification mostly of I. araguaiaensis (the Araguaian boto). Classifying the Araguaian boto separately from I. geoffrensis has important implications for the species in terms of conservation status, since it is restricted to a highly impacted river system.

ABSTRACT: Common dolphin distribution in the western Mediterranean is still poorly known, with the exception of the Alboran Sea. In French waters, the species occurrence is suspected to have strongly decreased during the 20th century. Small boat dedicated surveys from 1988 to 2012 were undertaken to describe common dolphin distribution in five regions of French waters and three southern regions of the western basin. A total survey effort of 38,561 km resulted in sightings of 25 common dolphin groups in the western basin. Common dolphins were rarely observed off the French continental coast, more frequently around Corsica, and were quite frequent in waters off western Sardinia. Their most favoured habitat was found to be in neritic or upper slope waters. The analysis of stranding records suggested that common dolphins were more abundant in French inshore waters prior to 1980. A major increase of pelagic fish landings occurred from the beginning of the 1960s in the western part of French waters. Local populations of common dolphins may have declined as a consequence of prey depletion. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The subpopulation of the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) living in the Mekong River, Cambodia, is considered to be critically endangered. The aim of the investigation was to gain information about the genetic variation, health status and exposure to toxic compounds of these dolphins. Tissue samples from 27 Irrawaddy river dolphins found dead along the Mekong River between 2004 and 2009 were analysed with regards to genetics, pathology and ecotoxicology. Genetic maternal lineage detection, based on polymorphisms of the mitochondrial d-loop sequences, was performed. Data indicate a genetic separation of the Mekong dolphins from both the coastal population and the Mahakam dolphins. Pathological investigations revealed acute moderate multifocal suppurative bronchopneumonia, moderate periportal hepatic lipidosis, moderate diffuse hepatic atrophy and acute severe diffuse suppurative leptomeningitis. Residue levels of organochlorines and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in Irrawaddy dolphins from the Mekong River were lower than the concentrations reported for other cetaceans in the coastal and riverine waters of Asia, except for Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. A high percentage of organic mercury compared to the immuno-toxic methylmercury was observed. Due to numerous confounding factors, it is not possible to relate levels of pollutants to observed morphological lesions. However, it is likely that chemical contaminants do adversely impact on the health of the Irrawaddy dolphins at present, and have also affected previous generations. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Toothed whales use powerful ultrasonic biosonar pulses (i.e. clicks) for echolocation. Underwater acoustic recordings have suggested that the majority of toothed whale species can be grouped acoustically as either producing broadband clicks or narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) clicks. Recently, it has been shown that Heaviside’s dolphins, Cephalorhynchus heavisidii, emit NBHF clicks for echolocation but also clicks of lower frequency and broader bandwidth for communication. Here, we use acoustic recorders and drone video footage to reinforce previous findings that Commerson’s dolphins (C. commersonii) produce signals similar to Heaviside’s dolphins. We reveal that they use clicks with a lower frequency and broader bandwidth in the form of click trains and burst-pulses. These sounds were not recorded in the presence of smaller groups of Commerson’s dolphins, indicating that they may fulfil a communication function in larger groups. Also, we utilised a novel combination of drone video footage paired with underwater acoustic recordings to estimate the source level of echolocation clicks produced by Commerson’s dolphins. In addition, we compare the acoustic signals produced by Commerson’s and Heaviside’s dolphins to identify interspecific similarities and differences. Spectral differences were found in NBHF click trains, buzzes and burst-pulses between species; however, bandwidth and duration parameters were not significantly different for broadband click trains. Our findings make it likely that all four species of the Cephalorhynchus genus have the ability to generate both signal types, and further challenges the evolutionary concept of NBHF signal production. Significance statement: This study confirms the presence of a duel echolocation click (i.e. biosonar) strategy in Commerson’s dolphins, making them the second species of their genus known to produce two types of biosonar. We provide an in-depth quantitative analysis of Commerson’s dolphin acoustic signal types, and include a comparison of signal types between Commerson’s dolphins and the other species known to produce two types of biosonar, the Heaviside’s dolphin. In addition, this is the first study to combine drone footage with underwater acoustic recordings to measure the source level of toothed whale echolocation signals. We use this novel technique to provide source levels measured from Commerson’s dolphin echolocation clicks which are comparable to published values for this species calculated using an expensive and complicated array of hydrophones. Thus, we provide a simpler and more cost effective way to study sounds produced by marine mammals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are top predators, feeding on a wide variety of prey species, several of which are also targeted by fisheries. The last remaining healthy group of the endangered Mediterranean common dolphin subpopulation is located in the Alboran Sea. Their feeding grounds overlap with the fishing grounds of trawlers targeting European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and blue whiting (Micromessistius poutassou) as well as purse seiners targeting small pelagic species such as European sardine (Sardina pilchardus), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and mackerel (Scomber spp.). In the present study, we estimated that individual common dolphins in the Alboran Sea have a food consumption of 3.35 ± 0.67 kg/day, based on scaling equations applied to stranded animals. This figure is similar to the ones reported for other European populations. Although common dolphins mainly feed on mesopelagic species of none or little commercial interest, they also feed on commercial species, which could lead to a potential conflict with fisheries in the area. We estimated common dolphins in the Alboran Sea could consume more than 16,000 tonnes of fish annually, including ca 7365 (95% CI: 3838–11,639) tonnes of Madeira lanternfish (Ceratoscopelus maderensis), 2,888 (1123–5223) tonnes of bogue (Boops boops), 2770 (879–5270) tonnes of European sardine, 1,850 (170–4116) tonnes of gobies (Gobiidae), and 1497 (65–3352) tonnes of European hake (reference period 2006-2011). Estimated sardine, anchovy and blue whiting consumption was low when compared to the landings in the area, however estimated hake consumption was above the reported hake landings in recent years (393.4 ± 146 tonnes landed annually between 2006 and 2011). Additionally, direct interactions between common dolphins and main fisheries were evaluated in a total of 111 observed fishing trips (70 in trawlers and 41 in purse seiners) in the area. Although no bycatch of common dolphin was recorded, non-lethal interactions between dolphins and the fishing activity were detected from observations of this on-board observer program. These interactions, together with the high prevalence of stranding with signs of fishing interactions from the study area, may imply an additional threat to this endangered cetacean subpopulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In the recent past, animal welfare studies have tried to determine the best animal welfare measures and indicators. Expression of behavioural diversity is considered a potential positive welfare indicator, and to the authors’ knowledge, it has not been validated nor studied in cetaceans. For the first time, a behavioural diversity study on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) groups was conducted at six European facilities. The study was carried out by the animal care staff, biologists and veterinarians and included 54 dolphins housed in several group compositions at the different participating facilities. The goal of our study was to analyse behavioural diversity in bottlenose dolphins at the group level to investigate how particular factors might impact the diversity of behaviours within the group and to discuss its implications for dolphin welfare assessments. Eight factors (i.e., “observer location”, “number of individuals”, “age class”, “sex”, “social grouping”, “presence/absence of leading male”, “presence/absence of visitors” and “enrichment provision”) impacted the behavioural diversity of the observed groups, while no significant impact of the factors “time of day” and “activity before/after observation” could be found. Our study showed the feasibility of this kind of approach for cetaceans under professional care and the relevance to considering this parameter in dolphin welfare studies, despite certain limitations that warrant further research. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Periodic assessments of population status and trends to detect natural influences and human effects on coastal dolphin are often limited by lack of baseline information. Here, we investigated for the first time the site-fidelity patterns and estimated the population size of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at the Tiber River estuary (central Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian Sea, Rome, Italy) between 2017 and 2020. We used photo-identification data and site-fidelity metrics to study the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area, and capture–recapture models to estimate the population abundance. In all, 347 unique individuals were identified. The hierarchical cluster analysis highlighted 3 clusters, labeled resident (individuals encountered at least five times, in three different months, over three distinct years; n = 42), part-time (individuals encountered at least on two occasions in a month, in at least two different years; n = 73), and transient (individuals encountered on more than one occasion, in more than 1 month, none of them in more than 1 year; n = 232), each characterized by site-fidelity metrics. Open POPAN modeling estimated a population size of 529 individuals (95% CI: 456–614), showing that the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions surrounding the Tiber River estuary represent an important, suitable habitat for bottlenose dolphins, despite their proximity to one of the major urban centers in the world (the city of Rome). Given the high number of individuals in the area and the presence of resident individuals with strong site fidelity, we suggest that conservation plans should not be focused only close to the Tiber River mouths but extended to cover a broader scale of area. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) belongs to the Cetartiodactyla and, similarly to other cetaceans, represents the most successful mammalian colonization of the aquatic envi-ronment. Here we report a genomic, evolutionary, and expression study of T. truncatus T cell receptor beta (TRB) genes. Although the organization of the dolphin TRB locus is similar to that of the other artiodactyl species, with three in tandem D-J-C clusters located at its 3’ end, its unique-ness is given by the reduction of the total length due essentially to the absence of duplications and to the deletions that have drastically reduced the number of the germline TRBV genes. We have analyzed the relevant mature transcripts from two subjects. The simultaneous availability of rear-ranged T cell receptor α (TRA) and TRB cDNA from the peripheral blood of one of the two speci-mens, and the human/dolphin amino acids multi-sequence alignments, allowed us to calculate the most likely interactions at the protein interface between the alpha/beta heterodimer in complex with major histocompatibility class I (MH1) protein. Interacting amino acids located in the com-plementarity-determining region according to IMGT numbering (CDR-IMGT) of the dolphin variable V-alpha and beta domains were identified. According to comparative modelization, the atom pair contact sites analysis between the human MH1 grove (G) domains and the T cell receptor (TR) V domains confirms conservation of the structure of the dolphin TR/pMH. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Regional populations (“subpopulations”) of globally abundant species can be exposed to human impacts that threaten their viability. Given the value of cetacean subpopulations as evolutionary significant units, keystone and umbrella species, it is important to assess their conservation status separately and propose area-specific conservation measures. We used a threat assessment process and applied IUCN Red List criteria to a regional population of common dolphins Delphinus delphis in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece. We compiled subpopulation-specific information about abundance and trends, estimated the geographic range of the subpopulation (area of occupancy and extent of occurrence), and calculated the probability of extinction through stochastic modelling. The subpopulation qualified as Endangered according to criteria A (population size reduction over three generations) and B (geographic range), and as Critically Endangered under criteria C (population size and decline) and D (very small or restricted population). The probability of extinction was estimated to be ≥50% in three generations, qualifying the subpopulation as Critically Endangered under criterion E (quantitative analysis). We concluded that the subpopulation should be classified as Critically Endangered. Considering the high extinction risk faced by common dolphins in the Gulf of Corinth, we recommend that: (a) immediate action is taken to mitigate anthropogenic activities known or suspected to have a negative impact on cetaceans in the area (particularly commercial fishing); and (b) a marine protected area is established in the Gulf of Corinth as a management tool for enforcing conservation action and facilitating the recovery of common dolphins. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) inhabit shallow coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region including southeast China, with at least 6 putative populations identified to date in Chinese waters. However, the connectivity among these populations has not yet been fully investigated. In the present study, we compared and cross-matched photographic catalogs of individual dolphins collected to date in the Pearl River Delta region, Leizhou Bay, Sanniang Bay, and waters southwest of Hainan Island, a total of 3158 individuals, and found no re-sighting of individual dolphins among the 4 study areas. Furthermore, there was a notable difference in the pigmentation pattern displayed by individuals from these 4 regions. We suggest that this may be a phenotypical expression of fine-scale regional differentiation among humpback dolphin groups, possibly distinct populations. Given the considerable conservation management implications it may carry (e.g. definition of management units), further research is much needed. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Adult survival is arguably the most important demographic parameter for long-lived species as it has a large impact on population growth, and it can be estimated for cetacean populations using natural markings and mark-recapture (MR) modelling. Here we describe a 26-year study of a genetically discrete, resident population of bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, conducted by an NGO using multiple platforms. We estimated survival rates (SRs) using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and explored the effects of variable survey effort, multiple researchers, and changes in camera equipment as well as capture heterogeneity induced by changes in marks and site fidelity variation, all common issues affecting longitudinal dolphin studies. The mean adult SR was 0.94 (±0.001 SD) and thus comparable to the estimates reported for other bottlenose dolphin populations. Capture heterogeneity through variation in mark severity was confirmed, with higher capture probabilities for well-marked individuals than for poorly marked individuals and a “transience” effect being detected for less well-marked individuals with 43% only recorded once. Likewise, both SR and capture probabilities were comparatively low for individuals with low site fidelity to the Shannon Estuary, and SR of these individuals additionally decreased even further toward the end of the study, reflecting a terminal bias. This bias was attributed to non-random temporal migration, and, together with high encounter rates in Brandon Bay, supported the hypothesis of range expansion. Our results highlight the importance of consistent and geographically homogenous survey effort and support the differentiation of individuals according to their distinctiveness to avoid biased survival estimates. © Copyright © 2021 Ludwig, Daly, Levesque and Berrow.

ABSTRACT: We examined bone mineral density (BMD) in the pectoral flipper of the common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. These data addressed the need to define a comprehensive target site for osteodensitometric assessment and to provide a descriptive bone density data set for this species. We analyzed 388 radii from 279 bottlenose dolphins using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the accepted standard in human medical studies. Radii were examined for differences based on sex, age, total body length, handedness, geographical affinity, and nutritional status at death. BMD increased with age and body length (R2 = 0.58, p <.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in BMD measurements for male and female dolphins (t = −1.60, p >.05) or right and left flippers (t = −1.76, p >.05). Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed based on geographical region (t = −0.190, p >.05) or nutritional status (F = 0.83, p >.05). These results support the use of these findings as a preliminary descriptive data set for BMD in bottlenose dolphins and detail a primary skeletal site for clinical assessment of bone density for the species. As this study relies on archived museum specimens collected from dolphins at time of death, further studies regarding bone density may be better addressed using live dolphins with known health status. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: South Asian river dolphins (Platanista gangetica) are among the most endangered of the world's cetaceans. The two subspecies in the family Platanistidae, Indus, and Ganges river dolphins (P. g. minor and P. g. gangetica), are both threatened by dams and barrages, declining river flows, fisheries bycatch, and pollution. We examine differences in external and skull morphology between dolphins in each river system to clarify their taxonomic status. Skulls from each river system could easily be differentiated using diagnostic differences in the shape of the frontal bones behind the nasals. This feature was present in all individuals irrespective of size, age, and sex. Ganges river dolphins are sexually dimorphic with females larger than males, but there was no evidence of dimorphism in the small sample of Indus river dolphins. There were no mitochondrial DNA haplotypes shared between the two river systems, and five fixed differences suggested a long-term (approximately 0.55 million years) absence of gene flow. Diagnosable differences in morphological and genetic characteristics indicate long-term reproductive as well as geographic isolation of Indus and Ganges river dolphins. We conclude that Indus and Ganges river dolphins should each be recognized as distinct species, and elevate the Indus subspecies, Platanista gangetica minor, to species level, Platanista minor Owen, 1853. Formal redescriptions are provided for both species. © 2021 The Authors. Marine Mammal Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Society for Marine Mammalogy.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) males follow many reproductive strategies to ensure their paternity. However, little is known about the sperm traits, including morphometric features, that contribute to their reproductive success. Our aim was to study dolphin sperm morphometry (a total of 13 parameters) in two adult males to evaluate (i) presumptive sperm subpopulations, (ii) the correlation of sperm morphometry with testosterone levels and (iii) the effect of refrigerated storage on the sperm morphometry. Sperm populations were classified into four principal components (PCs) based on morphometry (>94% of cumulative variance). The PCs clustered into two different sperm subpopulations, which differed between males. Furthermore, the levels of serum testosterone were positively correlated with the length of the midpiece but negatively correlated with head width and the principal piece, flagellum and total sperm lengths. Most of the sperm morphometric parameters changed during the storage period (day 1 vs. day 7), but only the principal piece length was affected by the storage temperature (5◦C vs. 15◦C). This is the first study to identify dolphin sperm subpopulations based on morphometry and the influence of serum testosterone and refrigeration on sperm morphometry. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The first Unusual Mortality Event (UME) related to fishing activity along the Atlantic coast recorded by the French Stranding Network was in 1989: 697 small delphinids, mostly common dolphins, washed ashore, most of them with evidence of having been bycaught. Since then, UMEs of common dolphins have been observed nearly every year in the Bay of Biscay; unprecedented records were broken every year since 2016. The low and unequally distributed observation efforts aboard fishing vessels in the Bay of Biscay, as well as the lack of data on foreign fisheries necessitated the use of complementary data (such as stranding data) to elucidate the involvement of fisheries in dolphin bycatch. The aim of this work was to identify positive spatial and temporal correlations between the likely origins of bycaught stranded common dolphins (estimated from a mechanistic drift model) and fishing effort statistics inferred from Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data on vessels >12 m long. Fisheries whose effort correlated positively with dolphin mortality areas after 2016 included French midwater trawlers, French Danish seiners, French gillnetters, French trammel netters, Spanish bottom trawlers, and Spanish gillnetters. For the French fleet only, logbook declarations, sales, and surveys carried out by Ifremer were integrated into fishing effort data. Six fleets were active in common dolphin bycatch areas at least twice between 2016 and 2019: gillnetters fishing hake, trammel netters fishing anglerfish, bottom pair trawlers fishing hake, midwater pair trawlers fishing sea bass and hake, and Danish seiners fishing whiting. Except for changes in hake landings in some fisheries, there were no notable changes in total fishing effort practice (gear or target species) based on the data required by the ICES and Council of the European Union that could explain the large increase in stranded common dolphins recorded along the French Atlantic coast after 2016. Small scale or unrecorded changes could have modified interactions between common dolphins and fisheries, but could not be detected through mandatory data-calls. The recent increase in strandings of bycaught common dolphins could have been caused by changes in their distribution and/or ecology, or changes in fishery practices that were undetectable through available data. © Copyright © 2021 Peltier, Authier, Caurant, Dabin, Daniel, Dars, Demaret, Meheust, Van Canneyt, Spitz and Ridoux.

ABSTRACT: Aim: In the marine environment, where there are few physical boundaries to gene flow, there is often nevertheless intraspecific diversity with consequences for effective conservation and management. Here, we compare two closely related dolphin species with a shared distribution in the Indian Ocean (IO) to better understand the biogeographic drivers of their population structure. Location: Global oceans and seas with a focus on the Indian Ocean. Taxon: Tursiops sp. and Delphinus sp. Methods: Bayesian, ordination, assignment, statistical and phylogenetic analyses to assess phylogeography, connectivity and population structure using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA genetic markers. Results: Both Tursiops sp. and Delphinus sp. showed population structure across the western IO and, in each case, populations in the Arabian Sea (off India, Pakistan and Oman) were most differentiated. Comparisons with other populations worldwide revealed independent lineages in this geographic region for both genera. For T. aduncus, (for which multiple sites within the IO could be compared), Bayesian modelling best supported a scenario of expansion southwards following a bottleneck event resulting in differentiation between the northern and western IO. For Delphinus, the same pattern is even more pronounced. Populations in the Arabian Sea region of the north-western IO show genetic isolation for each of the two genera, consistent with other studies of cetacean species in this region. Main conclusions: We propose that changes in the intensity of the southwest monsoon during the climate cycles of the Pleistocene could have affected regional patterns of productivity and represent an important biogeographic driver promoting the observed patterns of differentiation and population dynamics seen in our focal species. Patterns of population genetic structure are consistent with phenotypic differences, suggesting an influence from distinct habitats and resources, and emphasising the need for effective conservation measures in this geographic region. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As demands for wildlife tourism increase, provisioning has become a popular means of providing up-close viewing to the public. At Monkey Mia, Shark Bay, Australia, up to five adult female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) visit a 100 m stretch of beach daily to receive fish handouts. In 2011, a severe marine heatwave (MHW) devastated seagrass and fish populations in Shark Bay. Offspring survival declined precipitously among seagrass specialists (dolphins that forage disproportionately in seagrass habitat). As all provisioned dolphins at the site are seagrass specialists, we examined how provisioned and non-provisioned seagrass specialists responded to the MHW. Using 27 years of data we compare habitat use, home range size, calf mortality, and predation risk between provisioned and non-provisioned females and their offspring before and after the MHW. Our results show that provisioned females have extremely small home ranges compared to non-provisioned females, a pattern attributable to their efforts to remain near the site of fish handouts. However, weaned offspring (juveniles) born to provisioned females who are not provisioned themselves also had much smaller home ranges, suggesting a persistent maternal effect on their behavior. After the MHW, adult females increased their use of seagrass habitats, but not their home range size. Provisioned females had significantly lower calf mortality than non-provisioned females, a pattern most evident pre-MHW, and, in the first 5 years after the MHW (peri-MHW, 2011–2015), calf mortality did not significantly increase for either group. However, the ecosystem did not recover, and post-MHW (2016–2020), calf mortality was substantially higher, regardless of provisioning status. With few survivors, the impact of the MHW on juvenile mortality post-weaning is not known. However, over three decades, juvenile mortality among offspring of provisioned vs. non-provisioned females did not statistically differ. Thus, the survival benefits accrued to calves in the provisioned group likely cease after weaning. Finally, although shark attack rates on seagrass specialists did not change over time, elevated predation on calves cannot be ruled out as a cause of death post-MHW. We discuss our results as they relate to anthropogenic influences on dolphin behavioral plasticity and responses to extreme climate events. © Copyright © 2021 Mann, Foroughirad, McEntee, Miketa, Evans, Karniski, Krzyszczyk, Patterson, Strohman and Wallen.

ABSTRACT: Mucorales infections in cetaceans have a high mortality rate. This case report refers to a bottlenose dolphin calf with suspected mucormycosis treated with posaconazole. This antifungal agent was discontinued after 96 days of therapy, however, the infection relapsed. Posaconazole was then resumed for a total of 255 days, with no signs of disease reactivation. The retrospective analysis of posaconazole serum levels in this successful case showed concentrations varying between 5.18 and 11.63 mg/L. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Health assessments were conducted on bottlenose dolphins in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, USA, during 2011 to 2018, to assess potential health effects following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, compared to the unoiled Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA, reference dolphin population. We previously reported significant increases in T-lymphocyte proliferation, as well as lower T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, higher Th2 cytokine IL-4, and lower T regulatory (Treg) cytokine IL-10 in Barataria Bay in 2011 compared to Sarasota Bay, consistent with Deepwater Horizon oil exposure. Although values between 2013 and 2016 were more similar to those observed in Sarasota Bay, T-cell proliferation was again elevated and cytokine balance tilted toward Th2 in Barataria Bay during 2017–2018. In 2018, Barataria Bay dolphins had significantly more circulating Treg cells than Sarasota Bay dolphins. Mice experimentally exposed to oil also had significantly increased T-lymphocyte proliferation and circulating Treg cell number, including effects in their unexposed progeny. In vitro stimulation resulted in greater Th2 responsiveness in Barataria Bay compared to Sarasota Bay dolphins, and in vitro oil exposure of Sarasota Bay dolphin cells also resulted in enhanced Th2 responsiveness. Evidence points to Treg cells as a potential target for the immunomodulatory effects of oil exposure. The immunological trends observed in Barataria Bay appeared exaggerated in dolphins born after the spill, suggesting the possibility of continued oil exposure or multigenerational health consequences of exposure to oil, as observed in mice.

ABSTRACT: The mammalian intestinal microbiome is critical for host health and disease resistance. However, the cetacean intestinal microbiota remains relatively unexplored. By using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed intestinal bacterial samples from an Indo-pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) stranded near the Pearl River Estuary in China. The samples included 3 anatomical regions (foregut, midgut, and rectum) and 2 anatomical locations (content and mucus). Our analyses revealed that the dolphin intestinal bacteria contained 139 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), dominated at the phyla level by Firmicutes (47.05% in the content; 94.77% in the mucus), followed by Bacteroidetes (23.63% in the content; 1.58% in the mucus) and Gammaproteobacteria (14.82% in the content; 2.05% in the mucus). The intestinal bacteria had a small core community (15 OTUs, accounting for 99.74% of the reads), some of which could be potentially pathogenic to both human and dolphins. As an alternative to sampling the dolphin intestinal bacteria, fecal sampling could be used. Additionally, function potentials such as, xenobiotics biodegradation, beta-lactam resistance, and human disease-related pathways, were detected in the dolphin intestinal bacteria. These findings provide the first baseline knowledge of the intestinal microbiome of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, which may offer new insights into cetacean conservation by using microbial surveillance. © 2020 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This paper employs numerical simulation to study the hydrodynamics of porpoising behavior in dolphins. The virtual swimmer is a three-dimensional dolphin-like body with prescribed kinematics. A four-stage model of this behavior is proposed, including underwater acceleration, upward leap, air glide and downward dive. When the dolphin goes through these four stages, the time history of its displacement, velocity, force and energy could be solved to elucidate the rules. By varying oscillating frequency f and escape angle α, various behaviors of the swimmer are simulated to obtain their porpoising performance, which are evaluated by maximum leap height Hmax, maximum leap distance Dmax and leap efficiency η. The results show that both Hmax and Dmax are increasing functions of f, but their trend with α is not monotonic. For peak Hmax generation, α occurs at 90°, while for peak Dmax, α is ranging from 45° to 60° and nears 50°. As for efficiency, η increases slowly with the increase of α, and first increases and then decreases with the increase of f at a critical value between 7 Hz and 8 Hz. The findings may provide an important hydrodynamics basis for the biomimetic vehicle designs that mimic the porpoising motion of dolphins. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Hemispheric lateralization is a specialized neural and cognitive processing achieved preferentially by either the left or the right hemisphere of the brain. Among vertebrates, emotions processing seems to be lateralized, but the involvement of each hemisphere is still on debate. Our study investigated visual and motor laterality on five bottlenose dolphins’ (Tursiops truncatus) during spontaneous and experimentally induced emotional contexts. We measured motor laterality in pectoral used and swimming position during positive social interactions. Additionally, during training sessions, stimuli with positive or negative emotional valences were presented either on the dolphins’ left or right side. Emotional reactions toward stimuli were measured and a visual laterality index was calculated. Dolphins were visually left-lateralized during training sessions. They also reacted more when negative stimuli were presented on their left side than right side during the first stimuli presentation. Our results suggest that bottlenose dolphins, like other vertebrates, may present a right hemisphere dominance for social information processing, detection of and response to unpredictable or novel stimuli and a left-hemisphere dominance during escape responses inhibition. Further studies on a larger sample size should explore inter-individual variation and identify other potential contexts in which lateralization emerges. Emotional lateralization should be considered as a potential indicator for future dolphin welfare assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Humpback dolphins (Sousa spp.) are obligate shallow-water and resident species, and they typically live in fission–fusion societies composed of small-sized groups with changeable membership. However, we have scant knowledge of their behavioral ecology, starting with potential factors influencing inter-population variability of their group sizes. Here, we compiled a new global dataset of humpback dolphin group sizes based on 150 published records. Our data indicated an inter-specific consistency of group-living strategy among the 4 species in the Sousa genus, as these species preferred living in small-sized groups with a mean size of mostly no more than 10, a minimum size of single individual or small pairs, and a maximum size of several tens or ≈100. In addition, we clearly showed the geographic variations in group sizes of humpback dolphins at a global scale. We found that the geographic variations in humpback dolphin group sizes were primarily associated with the latitude, sea surface temperature, and abundance. To conclude, our findings provide insights into social dynamics and socioecological trade-offs of humpback dolphins, and help better understand how these resident animals adapted to their shallow-water habitats from the perspectives of biogeography and socioecology. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The acquisition and analysis of EEG signals of dolphins, a highly intelligent creature, has always been a focus of the research of bioelectric signals. Prevailing cable‐connected devices cannot be adapted to data acquisition very well when dolphins are in motion. Therefore, this study designs a novel, light‐weighted, and portable EEG acquisition device aimed at relatively unrestricted EEG acquisition. An embedded main control board and an acquisition board were designed, and all modules are encapsulated in a 162 × 94 × 60 mm3 waterproof device box, which can be tied to the dolphin’s body by a silicon belt. The acquisition device uses customized suction cups with embedded electrodes and adopts a Bluetooth module for wireless communication with the ground station. The sampled signals are written to the memory card on board when the Bluetooth communication is blocked. A limited experiment was designed to verify the effectiveness of the device functionality onshore and underwater. However, more rigorous long‐term tests on dolphins in various states with our device are expected in future to further prove its capability and study the movement‐related artifacts. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We assessed habitat use by the population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, in the waters off Zhanjiang, China, by performing boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2018. In total, we gathered 253 sightings of humpback dolphins. To assess habitat use of humpback dolphins within the study area, we measured two spatial metrics at each sighting site: WDT (tide-calibrated water-depth) and DS (distance to the nearest shore). Results showed that dolphins mainly were observed in shallow (WDT: 8.46 ± 5.13 m, mean ± SD) and inshore (DS: 2.17 ± 2.14 km) waters. Their preference of inhabiting shallow waters was more apparent during the wet season (April-September) than during the dry season (October-March); however, they were encountered in waters much closer to shore during the dry season than the wet season. By weighting survey effort, our sighting density maps further confirmed that humpback dolphins changed their habitat use between wet and dry seasons. Such spatiotemporal variations in dolphin habitat use might be associated with spatiotemporal movements of their prey. Our findings provide insights into variations in fine-scale habitat use of inshore apex predators, and also assist to designate proper conservation measures for these vulnerable animals.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the effect of stage-specific traits on species feeding habits can reveal how natural selection shapes life strategies. Amino acid (AA) nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) provide multiple proxies of habitat baseline values and diet that can improve our understanding of species feeding strategies relative to their animal metabolism. We evaluated the effect of body length as a proxy for life stage and sex on the feeding habits of the common dolphin Delphinus delphis delphis using δ13C and δ15N in bulk tissue and AAs δ15N from skin samples collected for almost two decades. For bulk δ13C and δ15N data, we used SIBER analysis to compare isotopic niches by sex and life stage. For AA δ15N data, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to estimate indices of trophic status (Δ15N and trophic position). The model reflected the natural hierarchical structure of AA data by partitioning variability into three sources: between laboratory replicates, within dolphins and among dolphins. Estimates of Δ15N based on all trophic and source AAs were more precise for each dolphin, less variable among dolphins and on average 2.4‰ higher than indices based on single trophic (Glx) and source (Phe) AAs. Precision was further increased when information was shared among individuals through random effects or regression models. Estimates of trophic position showed similar patterns. Both Δ15N and δ15Nbulk isotopic niches showed no difference by sex, suggesting that males and females have similar feeding habits and may not segregate. However, lower Δ15N values for weaning calves and smaller juveniles discriminate them from adults, whereas δ15N bulk isotopic niches do not. A trophic discrimination factor (TDFTro-Src) of 3.1‰ was required for reasonable estimates of trophic position for these dolphins. Together, the lack of δ15N differences between sexes, low variation between juveniles and adults and knowledge of common dolphins' social organization support intraspecific feeding cooperation as an important strategy to feed in the highly dynamic marine environment. Our study also presents an efficient way to analyse complex AA δ15N data using HBM to investigate foraging behaviour in long-lived marine species difficult to study in the wild. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Vibrissae are tactile hairs found mainly on the rostrum of most mammals. The follicle, which is surrounded by a large venous sinus, is called "follicle-sinus complex" (FSC). This complex is highly innervated by somatosensitive fibers and reached by visceromotor fibers that innervate the surrounding vessels. The surrounding striated muscles receive somatomotor fibers from the facial nerve. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), a frequently described member of the delphinid family, possesses this organ only in the postnatal period. However, information on the function of the vibrissal complex in this latter species is scarce. Recently, psychophysical experiments on the river-living Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) revealed that the FSC could work as an electroreceptor in murky waters. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology and innervation of the FSC of newborn (n = 8) and adult (n = 3) bottlenose dolphins. We used Masson's trichrome stain and antibodies against neurofilament 200 kDa (NF 200), protein gene product (PGP 9.5), substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to characterize the FSC of the two age classes. Masson's trichrome staining revealed a structure almost identical to that of terrestrial mammals except for the fact that the FSC was occupied only by a venous sinus and that the vibrissal shaft lied within the follicle. Immunostaining for PGP 9.5 and NF 200 showed somatosensory fibers finishing high along the follicle with Merkel nerve endings and free nerve endings. We also found SP-positive fibers mostly in the surrounding blood vessels and TH both in the vessels and in the mesenchymal sheath. The FSC of the bottlenose dolphin, therefore, possesses a rich somatomotor innervation and a set of peptidergic visceromotor fibers. This anatomical disposition suggests a mechanoreceptor function in the newborns, possibly finalized to search for the opening of the mother's nipples. In the adult, however, this structure could change into a proprioceptive function in which the vibrissal shaft could provide information on the degree of rotation of the head. In the absence of psychophysical experiments in this species, the hypothesis of electroreception cannot be rejected. © 2020 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: Wide-ranging connectivity patterns of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are generally poorly known worldwide and more so within the oceanic archipelagos of Macaronesia in the North East (NE) Atlantic. This study aimed to identify long-range movements between the archipelagos of Macaronesia that lie between 500 and 1,500 km apart, and between Madeira archipelago and the Portuguese continental shelf, through the compilation and comparison of bottlenose dolphin’s photo-identification catalogues from different regions: one from Madeira (n = 363 individuals), two from different areas in the Azores (n = 495 and 176), and four from different islands of the Canary Islands (n = 182, 110, 142 and 281), summing up 1791 photographs. An additional comparison was made between the Madeira catalogue and one catalogue from Sagres, on the southwest tip of the Iberian Peninsula (n = 359). Results showed 26 individual matches, mostly between Madeira and the Canary Islands (n = 23), and between Azores and Madeira (n = 3). No matches were found between the Canary Islands and the Azores, nor between Madeira and Sagres. There were no individuals identified in all three archipelagos. The minimum time recorded between sightings in two different archipelagos (≈ 460 km apart) was 62 days. Association patterns revealed that the individuals moving between archipelagos were connected to resident, migrant and transient individuals in Madeira. The higher number of individuals that were re-sighted between Madeira and the Canary Islands can be explained by the relative proximity of these two archipelagos. This study shows the first inter-archipelago movements of bottlenose dolphins in the Macaronesia region, emphasizing the high mobility of this species and supporting the high gene flow described for oceanic dolphins inhabiting the North Atlantic. The dynamics of these long-range movements strongly denotes the need to review marine protected areas established for this species in each archipelago, calling for joint resolutions from three autonomous regions belonging to two EU countries.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a coastal dolphin endemic to the western South Atlantic Ocean. The dolphin is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, with incidental catches in gillnet fisheries the greatest conservation concern for this species. Insights into the feeding habits of this dolphin are essential to understand its distribution, movements and use of habitat, which are fundamental for effective management of the species. The feeding habits of franciscana dolphins were investigated from analyses of stomach contents of animals incidentally caught by two fishing operations from southern and northern regions of the southern Brazilian coast. In this study we investigate the existence of intrapopulation (sexual maturity and sex-related) variation in the diet of the franciscana dolphin, evaluating the spatial (northern and southern geographic areas) and seasonal influences. The analyses were based on Linear and Generalized Linear Models (LM and GLM). The majority of identified prey species were bottom-dwelling teleosts and the squid Doryteuthis sanpaulensis. The most important prey differed spatially and seasonally between northern and southern regions of the study area, and our results revealed significant differences between sexes and sexual maturity stages, mainly related to prey species sizes. This variation might indicate differences in prey selection, availability or habitat use patterns among these groups. In any case, these dietary differences are likely to minimize intraspecific competition for food resources, and/or indicate spatio-temporal variation in prey availability.

ABSTRACT: Defining the activity patterns and social relationships of animals can provide valuable information related to animal welfare. Bottlenose dolphins under professional care engage in a variety of social and solitary activities, which may be influenced by conspecifics, time of day, and maternal behaviors. This study examined the social, solitary, and maternal behaviors of eight dolphins at one zoological facility. Data about social and solitary behaviors, nursing occurrences, and mother–calf pair swimming were collected five days per week over a ten-month period. The simple ratio index was used to calculate association rates for all dyads. Affiliative behaviors were the dominant behavior class and all behavior categories and swim states showed temporal oscillations throughout the day. The high association values within the mother–calf dyads suggested these ties remain strong through the second and third years of life. Preferred associates remained the same for some individuals in both social group compositions, while they differed for others. However, no large reductions in associations were recorded, suggesting strong relationships in the subgroups continued when other individuals were present. Examining sociality and activity levels may be a useful tool in continuing to improve welfare as they may be related to social groupings and environmental factors. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Standardized measures of behavior can be powerful tools for assessing the impact of whale watching activities on natural populations of cetaceans. To determine the possible impact of tourism on dolphins between a period without whale watching (1989–1992) (T1) and a period with whale watching (2010–2020) (T2), we examined the changes in the rate of surface behaviors, the group size of long-time resident bottlenose dolphins living in the waters of the Humboldt Current off Chile, and for T2 alone, we compared these differences between two localities, the Punta de Choros and Chañaral de Aceituno coves. We observed a significant decrease in the group size of the resident population and in the frequency of surface events associated with the absence and presence of tourism. For T2, we observed significant differences for the frequency of surface events between the Chañaral de Aceituno and Punta de Choros coves and differences in the frequency of surface events at different hours of the day. This was associated with the number of vessels at the time of the encounter. In addition, we observed for T2 that the most observed instantaneous response of the dolphins to the presence of tourist vessels was to avoid the boats, while approaching the boats was the least observed response. The number of vessels present in each dolphin encounter was the most important variable for our model as it explains these differences. These results show that tourism vessels have a significant impact on dolphin behavior and sociability, while the same population of dolphins have different spatial and temporal responses to different impacts of tourism. Further studies are needed to establish whether changes in the rate of surface behaviors are associated with higher levels of stress in dolphins and with effects on their health and reproductive success in the long term. © Copyright © 2021 Toro, Alarcón, Toro-Barros, Mallea, Capella, Umaran-Young, Abarca, Lakestani, Peña, Alvarado-Rybak, Cruz, Vilina and Gibbons.

ABSTRACT: From 2012 to 2017, serial ultrasonographic evaluation of 5 healthy bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, were performed over the course of 6 pregnancies in Enoshima Aquarium. A total of 98 ultrasonographic examinations were included in the study. In three out of six cases, two embryos were observed between umbilicus and genital slit, and side of umbilicus in the dam’s body. All embryos were located in right below the peritoneum and observed from 308 to 325 days pre-partum. These days were corresponding to from 58 to 61 days after copulation respectively. The diameter of the embryo sac was approximately 4 cm. In three cases, the fetal head was located in the dam’s left lateral between umbilicus and genital slit from approximately 90 days pre-partum to the parturition. A snout of fetus is at the top of the uterine horn, and the tail lies close to the cervix. All six calves were fluke-first births (breech presentation). It was conjectured that the contraction of the dam’s uterus during parturition forced the fetus to invert, and the fetal tail fluke was expelled from the dam’s body. In three cases, judging from orientation of fetal tail fluke faced towards left side of the dam, a fetal position might be RSL (Right Sacrum-Lateral) within the birth canal. In the other three cases, the left and right positions of the fetus and the dam’s body are reversed during pregnancy and parturition. © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Stimulation of the thyroid with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a potentially useful diagnostic of thyroid dysfunction, but little is known about the response of the thyroid to TSH stimulation in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). To better characterize the response of the dolphin thyroid to TSH stimulation, five adult dolphins participated in a TSH stimulation study. Dolphins voluntarily beached onto a padded mat and were given a 1.5 mg intramuscular injection of human recombinant TSH. Blood samples collected the day prior, at multiple intervals the day of, and daily for three days after the injection were analyzed via radioimmunoassay for free and total triiodothyronine (fT3 and tT3), and free and total thyroxine (fT4 and tT4). Significant increases in circulating fT3, fT4, and tT4 were observed with peaks occurring for all hormones the day after the TSH injection; maximal increases were 44%, 47%, and 23% for each hormone, respectively. Temporal patterns in the hormones potentially reflected feedback mechanisms countering the surge in fT3 following stimulation. Though recombinant human TSH was effective at stimulating hormone release, it is likely that use of dolphin or dolphin-derived TSH would enhance the clinical utility of the stimulation test, as would the development of antibodies specific to dolphin TSH. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We described the spatial segregation of two species of cetaceans, the common dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin. We also document the first direct observation of interspecific killing of a common dolphin by bottlenose dolphins and of interspecific necrophilia in cetaceans. The study was conducted from 2014 to 2019 in the Ría de Arousa (Northwest Spain). This study highlights that both species use this area as a foraging ground, although they show different patterns of occurrence (bottlenose dolphins were always observed in the ria and common dolphins were mostly observed outside). During the study period, bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins were only observed on five occasions at the same time and in the same area, including three occasions which led to the displacement of the common dolphin(s), and one lethal interaction. In this event, several bottlenose dolphins, including adults and calves, and males and females, aggressively herded, chased, and assaulted a common dolphin. After approximatively 10 min, the common dolphin corpse appeared floating at the surface, and several adult male bottlenose dolphins repeatedly pushed the body underneath the water surface and an (attempted) copulation was witnessed. We suggest that the common dolphin could have been killed for competition for food resources or practice for infanticide, and sexual arousal might have been triggered by expression of dominance. Further information about the occurrence of such behaviors, and the outcomes through specific studies on fitness would be crucial to further understand the implication of such events. © 2021, ISPA, CRL.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic impacts in estuarine systems can influence marine mammal habitat use, population dynamics, fitness, and mortality events. The objective was to examine habitat use among the resident common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) population inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, and the influences of variation in environmental factors and prey availability in 2003–2015. We utilized photo-identification surveys, stratified random samples of prey, and environmental variables collected monthly. Kernel density estimation was used to determine the magnitude-per-unit area of dolphins across the IRL by wet and dry seasons each year, the values were used as a response variable in classification and regression tree analyses with fish community and environmental variables as predictors. Spatial patterns in dolphin density in the IRL were associated with salinity and dissolved oxygen levels, which are in part associated with freshwater discharges of nutrient and algae laden waters from the region's storm water management system. These findings isolate locations of concern for management of dolphin habitat, and anthropogenic drivers of dolphin distributions requiring further research. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work is to assess potential effects on dolphins caused by fishing Small Pelagic Fish (SPF) in the North Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean, Greece) ecosystem due to competition for food. To this end, an existing Ecopath ecosystem model was updated with dolphins' abundance estimates derived from a recent dedicated aerial survey. The approach included the quantification of trophic impacts and the estimation of the fraction of production of SPF that is consumed by dolphins and their main competitor, the purse seine (PS) fishery. Overall, competition for resources (i.e., SPF) between purse seines and dolphins was at relatively low levels as revealed by the analyses of flows in the “small pelagic fish - dolphins - fisheries” triangle, despite the relatively high abundance of dolphins in the NAS compared to adjacent areas. Specifically, the consumption of anchovy's production by dolphins was very low (3.6%) while consumption by the PS fleet was almost four times higher (13.1%). A much larger fraction (71.8%) of consumption of anchovy's production was attributed to other predators. The competition for sardine was at slightly higher levels than for anchovy (4.6% consumption by dolphins and 20.4% removals by the PS fleet). Even when different SPF abundance estimates were assumed to take into account uncertainty and historical records from acoustic surveys, food competition didn't seem to be an important issue. Nevertheless, as anchovy (and to a lower extent sardine) was found to be a key forage species in the North Aegean Sea ecosystem according to two food web indices (SURF and Connectance indices) estimated, special attention should be placed to ensure that the dolphins' populations are not threatened by food depletion in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) has a worldwide distribution, from tropical to temperate seas and oceans. Because of the high degree of geographic variation, the taxonomy of the species is still uncertain. Skulls from 195 museum specimens from nine marine areas were examined using two- and three-dimensional geometric morphometrics. Size and shape variations were analysed using univariate and multivariate statistics among and within areas. Sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic allometry were explored in the largest sample from the south-eastern Pacific Ocean, and significant differences in size between males and females, and effects on shape from sex and marine area interactions were detected, showing that the extreme traits of larger males were a consequence of continuous growth along a common allometric trajectory. A first multivariate ordination of three-dimensional data allowed the detection of highly derived long-beaked morphotypes that were identified as D. delphis tropicalis. An analysis of large-scale shape variation on two-dimensional data in the remaining 142 short-beaked specimens highlighted significant differences between southern and northern stocks, mainly in terms of the relative proportion of the rostrum and the braincase, suggesting an adaptive convergence irrespective of ocean of origin. The results also revealed a clear distinction in the skull shape of the north-eastern Pacific Ocean stock and a large shape variation in the Mediterranean stock. Geometric morphometrics of the skull provided a highly accurate method to investigate the geographic variability in common dolphins, confirming previous genetic findings and highlighting new patterns of likely adaptive variations deserving further study, at both large and small geographic scales. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The poorly known Clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene) is a small oceanic cetacean distributed in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. In this study, we report, for the first time, a vagrant individual of Clymene dolphin in Argentina (Rada Tilly) that represents the current southern-most record for this cetacean species. We provide a molecular identification of the dolphin, based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, generated from DNA extracted from its metazoan parasites. Three prey species, namely Argentine hake, Patagonian squid and lobster krill were identified from hard pieces collected in the stomach. Seven metazoan parasite taxa (three in adult stage, one immature stage and three in larval stage) were identified using morphological and molecular data, i.e., the digenean Pholeter gastrophilus (new host record), the cestodes Tetrabothrius (Tetrabothrius) forsteri, Clistobothrium grimaldii unidentified phyllobothriid plerocercoids, the nematodes Anisakis pegreffii (new host record), Halocercus delphini and the acanthocephalan Corynosoma australe (new host record). Our study provides the first molecular exploration of the metazoan parasite diversity in delphinids from the southwestern Atlantic, and contributes significantly to understand the poorly known parasite fauna of the Clymene dolphin. © Copyright © 2021 Hernández-Orts, Hernández-Mena, Pantoja, Kuchta, García, Crespo and Loizaga.

ABSTRACT: Synchronous behaviours occur when two or more animals display the same behaviour at the same time. However, the mechanisms underlying this synchrony are not well understood. In this study, we carried out an experiment to determine whether or not Bottlenose dolphins use acoustic cues when performing a known synchronised exercise. For this, we recorded three dolphins while they performed requested aerial jumps both individually or synchronously in pairs, with a hydrophone array and a 360° underwater video camera allowing the identification of the subject emitting vocalisations. Results indicated that in pairs, dolphins synchronised their jumps 100% of the time. Whether they jumped alone or in pairs, they produced click trains before and after 92% of jumps. No whistles or burst-pulsed sounds were emitted by the animals during the exercise. The acoustic localisation process allowed the successful identification of the vocalising subject in 19.8% of all cases (N = 141). Our study showed that in all (n = 28) but one successful localisations, the click trains were produced by the same individual. It is worth noting that this individual was the oldest female of the group. This paper provides evidence suggesting that during synchronous behaviours, dolphins use acoustic cues, and more particularly click trains, to coordinate their movements; possibly by eavesdropping on the clicks or echoes produced by one individual leading the navigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Adaptation is a biological mechanism by which organisms adjust physically or behaviorally to changes in their environment to become more suited to it. This is a report of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins’ behavioral adaptations to environmental changes from coastal construction in prime habitat. Construction was a 5-year bridge removal and replacement project in a tidal inlet along west central Florida’s Gulf of Mexico coastline. It occurred in two consecutive 2.5-year phases to replace the west and east lanes, respectively. Lane phases involved demolition/removal of above-water cement structures, below-water cement structures, and reinstallation of below + above water cement structures (N = 2,098 photos). Data were longitudinal (11 years: 2005–2016, N = 1,219 surveys 2–4 times/week/11 years, N = 4,753 dolphins, 591.95 h of observation in the construction zone, 126 before-construction surveys, 568 during-construction surveys, 525 after-construction surveys). The dependent variable was numbers of dolphins (count) in the immediate construction zone. Three analyses examined presence/absence, total numbers of dolphins, and numbers of dolphins engaged in five behavior states (forage-feeding, socializing, direct travel, meandering travel, and mixed states) across construction. Analyses were GLIMMIX generalized linear models for logistic and negative binomial regressions to account for observation time differences as an exposure (offset) variable. Results showed a higher probability of dolphin presence than absence before construction began, more total dolphins before construction, and significant decreases in the numbers of feeding but not socializing dolphins. Significant changes in temporal rhythms also revealed finer-grained adaptations. Conclusions were that the dolphins adapted to construction in two ways, by establishing feeding locations beyond the disturbed construction zone and shifting temporal rhythms of behaviors that they continued to exhibit in the construction zone to later in the day when construction activities were minimized. This is the first study to suggest that the dolphins learned to cope with coastal construction with variable adjustments. © Copyright © 2021 Weaver.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) typically feed on prey that are high in lipid and protein content and nearly devoid of carbohydrate, a dietary feature shared with other marine mammals. However, unlike fasted-Adapted marine mammals that predictably incorporate fasting into their life history, dolphins feed intermittently throughout the day and are not believed to be fasting-Adapted. To assess whether the physiological response to fasting in the dolphin shares features with or distinguishes them from those of fastingadapted marine mammals, the plasma metabolomes of eight bottlenose dolphins were compared between post-Absorptive and 24-h fasted states. Increases in most identified free fatty acids and lipid metabolites and reductions in most amino acids and their metabolites were consistent with the upregulation of lipolysis and lipid oxidation and the downregulation of protein catabolism and synthesis. Consistent with a previously hypothesized diabetic-like fasting state, fasting was associated with elevated glucose and patterns of certain metabolites (e.g. citrate, cis-Aconitate, myristoleic acid) indicative of lipid synthesis and glucose cycling to protect endogenous glucose from oxidative disposal. Pathway analysis predicted an upregulation of cytokines, decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis including apoptosis of insulin-secreting β-cells. Metabolomic conditional mutual information networks were estimated for the post-Absorptive and fasted states and topological modules' were estimated for each using the eigenvector approach to modularity network division. A dynamic network marker indicative of a physiological shift toward a negative energy state was subsequently identified that has the potential conservation application of assessing energy state balance in at-risk wild dolphins. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The evaluation of zoo animals’ personalities can likely lead to a range of benefits, including improving breeding success, creating stable social groups, and designing and developing environmental enrichment programmes. The goal of this study was to use caretakers scores to evaluate personality in bottlenose dolphins and to assess the reliability of scores within each rater and among raters from each centre. To this end, 24 caretakers from 3 countries (Spain, France, and Argentina), including a total of 5 dolphinariums and 6 groups of dolphins, used a questionnaire based on the Five-Factor Model of Personality to score bottlenose dolphins on a number of personality traits in three different contexts. Each caretaker evaluated the animals under their care twice, ensuring that raters did not share thoughts nor impressions with other raters. Our findings showed a good degree of agreement between each rater’s scores and a fair degree of agreement among scores of raters from the same centre. We also identified which raters and centres had significant mean score differences and detected that 4 out of 24 raters from two different centres showed such differences systematically. The evaluation of raters’ reliability and the identification of particular inconsistent raters and centres is critical to make more appropriate and realistic management decisions that, in turn, directly impact animals’ welfare. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this work, the fetal and newborn anatomical structures of the dolphin oropharyngeal cavities were studied. The main technique used was endoscopy, as these cavities are narrow tubular spaces and the oral cavity is difficult to photograph without moving the specimen. The endoscope was used to study the mucosal features of the oral and pharyngeal cavities. Two pharyngeal diver-ticula of the auditory tubes were discovered on either side of the choanae and larynx. These spaces begin close to the musculotubaric channel of the middle ear, are linked to the pterygopalatine re-cesses (pterygoid sinus) and they extend to the maxillopalatine fossa. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), osteological analysis, sectional anatomy, dissections, and histology were also used to better understand the function of the pharyngeal diverticula of the auditory tubes. These data were then compared with the horse’s pharyngeal diverticula of the auditory tubes. The histology revealed that a vascular plexus inside these diverticula could help to expel the air from this space to the naso-pharynx. In the oral cavity, teeth remain inside the alveolus and covered by gums. The marginal papillae of the tongue differ in extension depending on the fetal specimen studied. The histology reveals that the incisive papilla is vestigial and contain abundant innervation. No ducts were ob-served inside lateral sublingual folds in the oral cavity proper and caruncles were not seen in the prefrenular space. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Killer whale (Orcinus orca) populations specialize in both prey and prey acquisition tactics around the world and may be a primary evolutionary driver of the habits of small cetaceans. Entanglement in fishing gear is the most significant anthropogenic threat to the survival of cetaceans worldwide. Distinguishing between natural and human-caused sources of mortality and injury is a key task in marine mammal conservation and management. In British Columbia (BC), Canada, mammal-eating killer whales co-occur with Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Bycatch mortality rates are unknown here due to lack of systematic fisheries observer coverage. Drawing from more than three decades of first-hand observations of killer whale attacks on Pacific white-sided dolphins, we identify common themes with respect to predatory behavior of killer whales and anti-predatory responses of dolphins. With input from veterinary pathologists, we outline clues to distinguish killer whale rake marks from scars and wounds likely to be caused by fishery interactions. We examined photographs of 415 well-marked Pacific white-side dolphins for evidence of injuries and scars consistent with either killer whale attacks or fishery interactions. In this case study, healed scars from interactions with killer whale predators were ∼8× more common than scars from fishery interactions (3.9 vs. 0.5%), suggesting that predation is a much bigger threat to Pacific white-sided dolphins in the study area than anthropogenic impacts, or that dolphins are much less likely to survive a fishery interaction than a predation attempt. To advance our knowledge on poorly studied species, multiple lines of evidence will be needed. © Copyright © 2021 Ashe, Williams, Morton and Hammond.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammal body composition has been an important tool that is used as a proxy for the health and condition of individuals within a population. Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) body composition is influenced by variations in blubber thickness resulting from changes in temperature, prey availability, health, and life-history traits. We examined how environmental, ontogenetic, and reproductive variables influenced the body composition of common bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay using data collected from a long-term monitoring project by the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program (SDRP). We found that both sea surface temperature (SST) and catch per unit effort (CPUE), used as a proxy for prey availability, influenced body composition. There was a high degree of seasonality in body composition, with higher values occurring in winter when SST and CPUE were both low. Ontogeny also greatly influenced body composition, as younger dolphins typically had thicker blubber than mature individuals. Interestingly, young females allocated more energy to allometric growth than deposition of blubber for body composition when compared to young males. However, as females matured and their growth slowed, they invested more in body composition. We found no significant difference in body composition of females of varying reproductive states, providing further evidence of their status as true income breeders. Our work highlights that changes in body composition result from fluctuations in environmental variables and that energy allocation to body composition changes with ontogeny. © Copyright © 2021 Adamczak, Holser, Costa, Berens McCabe and Wells.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) is a virulent pathogen that causes high mortality outbreaks in delphinids globally and is spread via contact among individuals. Broadly ranging nearshore and open-ocean delphinids are likely reservoir populations that transmit DMV to estuarine populations. We assessed the seroprevalence of DMV antibodies and determined the habitat use of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus truncatus, from two estuarine sites, Barataria Bay and Mississippi Sound, in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We predicted that risk to DMV exposure in estuarine dolphins is driven by spatial overlap in habitat use with reservoir populations. Serum was collected from live-captured dolphins and tested for DMV antibodies. Habitat use of sampled individuals was determined by analysing satellite-tracked movements and stable isotope values. DMV seroprevalences were high among dolphins at Barataria Bay (37%) and Mississippi Sound (44%), but varied differently within sites. Ranging patterns of Barataria Bay dolphins were categorized into two groups: Interior and Island-associated. DMV seroprevalences were absent in Interior dolphins (0%) but high in Island-associated dolphins (45%). Ranging patterns of Mississippi Sound dolphins were categorized into three groups: Interior, Island-east and Island-west. DMV seroprevalences were detected across Mississippi Sound (Interior: 60%; Island-east: 20%; and Island-west: 43%). At both sites, dolphins in habitats with greater marine influence had enriched δ13C values, and Barataria Bay dolphins with positive DMV titres had carbon isotope values indicative of marine habitats. Positive titres for DMV antibodies were more common in the lower versus upper parts of Barataria Bay but evenly distributed across Mississippi Sound. A dolphin's risk of exposure to DMV is influenced by how individual ranging patterns interact with environmental geography. Barataria Bay's partially enclosed geography likely limits the nearshore or open-ocean delphinids that carry DMV from interacting with dolphins that use interior, estuarine habitats, decreasing their exposure to DMV. Mississippi Sound's relatively open geography allows for greater spatial overlap and mixing among estuarine, nearshore and/or open-ocean cetaceans. The spread of DMV, and likely other diseases, is affected by the combination of individual movements, habitat use and the environment. © 2021 British Ecological Society

ABSTRACT: Mexico is one of the top 10 whale-watching destinations in the world. The target species for “whale watching” (WW) are the gray whale, blue whale, humpback whale, and fin whale; the target species for “swim with dolphins” (SWD) are the bottlenose dolphin, spotted dolphin, spinner dolphin, and killer whale. WW has an increment of 666% income, 94% of trips, and 51% in the jobs generated in the last 11 years. Although Mexican legislation to regulate WW appears to be well designed, the great challenge is applying this normative in the field. In particular, it has been observed that surveillance and enforcement of normative differ significantly whether WW has carried out within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) or area without such designation. WW of gray and blue whales in El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve and Bahía de Loreto National Park, respectively, is developed within the MPAs. They are considered examples of acceptable WW practices. In contrast, in places without protected status as Puerto Vallarta, Jal., and Los Cabos, Baja California Sur (BCS), the WW practices have different problems related to boats’ presence without permission as sport fishing boats, private boats, and jet skis that do not respect WW guidelines. On the other hand, creating normativity or policies to regulate SWD in Mexico represents a current challenge. It is also a challenge to promote that local communities are involved in carrying out WW and SWD and are included in granting permits and the jobs and benefits of the economic spillover that these tourist activities generate. © Copyright © 2021 Urbán and Viloria-Gómora.

ABSTRACT: Many cetaceans are exposed to increasing pressure caused by anthropogenic activities in their marine environment. Anthropogenic sound has been recognized as a possible stressor for cetaceans that may have impacts on health. However, the relationship between stress, hormones, and cytokines secretion in cetaceans is complex and not fully understood. Moreover, the effects of stress are often inconsistent because the character, intensity, and duration of the stressors are variable. For a better understanding of how anthropogenic sounds affect the psychophysiology of cetaceans, the present study compared the changes of cortisol concentration and cytokine gene transcriptions in blood samples and behaviors of captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) after sound exposures. The sound stimuli were 800 Hz pure-tone multiple impulsive sound for 30 min at three different sound levels (estimated mean received SPL: 0, 120, and 140 dB re 1 μPa) that likely cause no permanent and temporary hearing threshold shift in dolphins. Six cytokine genes (IL-2Rα, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) were selected for analysis. Cortisol levels and IL-10 gene transcription increased and IFNγ/IL-10 ratio was lower after a 30-min high-level sound exposure, indicating the sound stimuli used in this study could be a stressor for cetaceans, although only minor behavior changes were observed. This study may shed light on the potential impact of pile driving-like sounds on the endocrine and immune systems in cetaceans and provide imperative information regarding sound exposure for free-ranging cetaceans. © Copyright © 2021 Yang, Chen, Chuah, Zhuang, Chen, Mooney, Stott, Blanchard, Jen and Chou.

ABSTRACT: Construction-related loss of habitat, degradation of existing habitat, noise pollution, and vessel activity are growing issues for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) that occur in the shallow, near-shore, highly industrialized waters off Lantau Island, Hong Kong. We studied the occurrence of dolphins in discrete locations, fine-scale movement patterns, and dolphin behavioral activity states. Potential explanatory variables varied and included year, season, time of day, dolphin group size and behavioral activity state, proximity to construction activity, and vessel type and number. Land-based observations and theodolite tracking of dolphins and vessels were conducted from seven locations to the north of Lantau Island, Hong Kong, and marine construction activities near survey sites were identified. A total of 636 groups of dolphins were recorded, totaling 150.91 h of tracking, from 405 days of observation effort. Hurdle models were used to analyze dolphin occurrence, multivariate generalized additive models were used to analyze fine-scale movement patterns, and log-likelihood ratio and binomial z score post hoc tests were used to analyze behavioral activity states. Dolphin occurrence was lower in historically important areas near long-term, low-intensity construction activity, and dolphin swimming speed was higher in response to vessel presence. Overall, foraging and traveling were the most frequently observed behavioral activity states and resting behavior was observed off only one location that was not in proximity to construction activities. Temporal overlap in adjacent marine construction areas may displace animals for extended periods and nearby ecologically similar habitats should be identified and designated as marine protected areas to mitigate effects of such disturbance. © Copyright © 2021 Piwetz, Jefferson and Würsig.

ABSTRACT: The Shannon dolphins are a population of bottlenose dolphins resident year round within the Lower River Shannon SAC, Ireland, which has been designated to protect this relatively small, genetically discrete population. Although trends in habitat use and foraging have been studied within the estuary, little is known about the movements of the Shannon dolphins outside the boundaries of the SAC, and whether any other foraging hotspots exist for this population outside of the estuary. The purpose of this study was to explore the presence and foraging behavior of these dolphins in adjacent waters located 20–30 km to the southwest of the Lower River Shannon SAC. Static acoustic monitoring was carried out with C-PODs deployed in Ballyheigue Bay, Brandon Bay, and around the Maharees between May and November 2013. A GEE-GLM modelling approach was then used to analyze potential significant environmental predictors of presence and foraging by bottlenose dolphins at these sites. Brandon Bay was found to be a site of particular importance for the Shannon population, where dolphins were present on 92% of days monitored and foraging occurring on 20% of all monitored hours. The results of this study indicate that Brandon Bay is a potentially important habitat for the Shannon dolphins and further support designation of this site as a candidate SAC. However, long-term acoustic monitoring should be conducted at all sites to identify relative use of the areas at year-round and inter-annual scales. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: During the last decade, the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) has become the second most sighted species in Israeli coastal waters, after the common bottlenose dolphin. Documentation mostly relies on opportunistic, photo and/or video-backed second-party reports, delimited within a 10 km near-shore strip. Sightings occur year round, are confined to the southern part of the Israeli coast and typically comprise relatively large groups (mean ± SD: 21.5 ± 13.3), often with young calves. Strandings are relatively scarce, typically one per year, and have so far yielded five upper digestive tract contents for diet analysis. Cephalopods comprised 1.2% of the estimated number of prey items in the combined content. Surprisingly, by far the most abundant and prevalent prey item found (57% of pooled prey items; present and dominant in four out of five tracts) was the Balearic eel (Ariosoma balearicum), a sand burrower which is also a major dietary component of the common bottlenose dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins in Israel are known to forage in association with bottom trawlers, leading to the notion that common dolphins also make use of this foraging mode. Indeed, in addition to their association with purse seiners, they have been documented accompanying bottom trawlers, by both day and night. The slender Balearic eels are frequently found protruding from the net's eyes, presumably making easy prey for both dolphin species. Information gaps on common dolphins include range extension to the south/south-west, abundance estimation and genetic flow/isolation. Even so, its unusual diet and the fact that the closest known populations to the north/north-west are from the Aegean Sea, were major considerations in the recent designation of the ‘Coastal Shelf Waters of the South-east Levantine Sea’ as a Mediterranean Important Marine Mammal Area. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Animal sounds are commonly used by humans to infer information about their motivations and their health, yet, acoustic data is an underutilized welfare biomarker especially for aquatic animals. Here, we describe an acoustic monitoring system that is being implemented at the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program where dolphins live in groups in ocean enclosures in San Diego Bay. A four-element bottom mounted hydrophone array is used to continuously record, detect and localize acoustic detections from this focal group. Software provides users an automated comparison of the current acoustic behavior to group historical data which can be used to identify periods of normal, healthy thriving dolphins, and allows rare instances of deviations from typical behavior to stand out. Variations in a group or individual’s call rates can be correlated with independent veterinary examinations and behavioral observations in order to better assess dolphin health and welfare. Additionally, the monitoring system identifies time periods in which a sound source from San Diego Bay is of high-enough amplitude that the received level at our array is considered a potential concern for the focal animals. These time stamps can be used to identify and potentially mitigate exposures to acoustic sources that may otherwise not be obvious to human listeners. We hope this application inspires zoos and aquaria to innovate and create ways to incorporate acoustic information into their own animal welfare management programs. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Assessments of species distributions are crucial for informing conservation and management action. In this study, we used ensemble modelling to explain the distribution of Near Threatened Indo-Pacific (IP) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in coastal waters at the North West Cape (NWC), Western Australia (WA), an area encompassing a marine protected area (MPA) and adjacent unprotected coastal waters. Analyses used dolphin sighting data collected during boat-based surveys conducted from 2013 to 2015 and 2018 to 2019. Overall, the distribution of IP bottlenose dolphins was best explained by distance to coast (up to 2,000 m) and distance to boat ramp (up to 7,000 m). Areas of high probability of occurrence for dolphins extended from the tip and down the eastern side of the NWC and overlapped with designated sanctuary zones as well as waters beyond the boundaries of the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP). Distribution and habitat preferences varied slightly with season. In autumn, dolphin distribution was best explained by distance to coast and water depth with a higher likelihood of observing dolphins 1,000–2,000 m from the coast and in water depths of 7–10 m deep. During winter months, distance to coast (1,000–2,000 m) and sea surface temperature (SST) (21.5–23.5°C) were the most important explanatory variables, with presence in coastal lagoons to the west of the NWC more likely than other seasons. During spring, areas of moderate to high probability of dolphin occurrence were mainly located outside the NMP, with marine park zone (outside the NMP and Sanctuary zones within the NMP, the two zones with the highest probability of IP bottlenose dolphin occurrence) and water depth (waters 7–13 m deep) best explaining dolphin distribution. This study highlights the importance of inshore areas of the NWC for IP bottlenose dolphins and the potential vulnerability of this species to increasing and cumulative anthropogenic stressors associated with these areas. Results of this study should be considered in future zoning reviews and adaptive management efforts of the NMP allowing for effective management of this Near Threatened species. © Copyright © 2021 Haughey, Hunt, Hanf, Passadore, Baring and Parra.

ABSTRACT: The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region on the southeast coast of China has long been known as a highly productive fishing ground. Since the late 1980s, fishing pressure in the PRD has been intense, which warrants concerns of potential fishery-related impacts on the food resources and foraging ecology of apex marine predators in this region, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). In this study, we examined 54 stomachs with food remains, collected from beached carcasses of humpback dolphins recovered during fifteen years between 2003 and 2017. The 6043 identified prey items represent 62 teleost taxa, primarily small estuarine fish, but also larger reef fish. The dolphins appear to be opportunistic foragers, hunting across the water-column, with preference for shoaling and meaty fishes (e.g. Collichthys lucidus IRI% = 38.6%, Johnius belangerii IRI% = 23.1%, Mugil cephalus IRI% = 14.0%). Our findings suggest a dietary shift in recent years, from primarily demersal (as previously reported) to greater intake of neritic and pelagic fish. Dolphin foraging group size has decreased in recent years, which corresponds with declining size and numbers of prey items retrieved from dolphin stomachs. We suggest that these are indicators of declining food resources. Faced with a shortage of preferred prey, humpback dolphins may have broadened their dietary spectrum to maintain their daily energy intake, while their foraging group size decreased in response to the altered tradeoff between the costs and benefits of group foraging. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, Taiwan’s government has focused on policies regarding offshore wind farming near the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin habitat, where marine mammal observation is a critical consideration. The present research developed an algorithm called National Taiwan University Passive Acoustic Monitoring (NTU_PAM) to assist marine mammal observers (MMOs). The algorithm performs whistle detection processing and whistle localization. Whistle detection processing is based on image processing and whistle feature extraction; whistle localization is based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) method. To test the whistle detection performance, we used the same data to compare NTU_PAM and the widely used software PAMGuard. To test whistle localization, we designed a real field experiment where a sound source projected simulated whis-tles, which were then recorded by several hydrophone stations. The data were analyzed to locate the moving path of the source. The results show that localization accuracy was higher when the sound source position was in the detection region composed of hydrophone stations. This paper provides a method for MMOs to conveniently observe the migration path and population dynamics of cetaceans without ecological disturbance. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Stenella clymene is an endemic species of dolphin living in tropical regions in the Atlantic Ocean. Despite its wide distribution, there is still scarce information on Stenella clymene, including its reproductive biology. In this context, this work describes the morphology of the whole male reproductive tract of the Clymene dolphin. Five males (N = 5) were studied after stranding on the northeast coast of Brazil. The analysis was performed through the use of macroscopic techniques and light and scanning microscopy. The male reproductive system consists of large testes wrapped around the tunica albuginea and adhered to the epididymis; the testes are attached to the abdominal cavity by the mesorchium. The ductus deferens is convoluted in the proximal portion and rectilinear in the distal portion. The prostate was the only accessory gland found, which is submerged by the prostate compressor muscle and lined with a dense fibroelastic capsule. The penis is classified as fibroelastic, with a spiral sigmoid flexure associated with a large volume of muscle tissue. The penis is inserted into two vestigial bones or pelvic bones, which exhibit no connection with the spine. In conclusion, the macro- and microscopic conformation and other morphofunctional features of the male reproductive organs of Stenella clymene are in accord with the anatomy observed in other Cetartiodactyla. © 2020 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

ABSTRACT: When implementing conservation strategies involving passive acoustic monitoring, an accurate description of signal properties is crucial, especially when studying threatened and elusive vocalizing species. Misrepresentation of detected sounds can result in information loss or misclassification of species, thus compromising the management process. Distortion of the time–frequency features depends on the characteristics of acoustic propagation through sea water, sensitivity and sampling frequency of the acquisition system and distance between cetacean source and the receiving sensor (hydrophone). This study examined how the sampling frequency and the distance from the source affect the properties of burst pulsed sounds emitted by short-beaked common dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea and how the signal is modified in relation to the recording scenarios. Burst pulses were collected at 300 000 samples/s, and down-sampled at 192 000, 96 000, 48 000 and 44 100. Fifteen acoustic parameters were automatically measured. The median values were measured and compared among the signals sampled at different rates. Finally, a transmission loss model was applied to explore the variation of the power spectrum density during click propagation through seawater. The results showed that, even if higher sampling rates are a more accurate match with the original signal, some parameters (number of clicks, inter-click-interval and maximum peak) measured at 96 000 and 192 000 Hz did not display significant differences compared with 300 000 Hz, except for the frequency parameters. The transmission loss model also showed that the highest frequency components strongly attenuate within 800 m from the source. These results suggest that high recording distances and lower sampling rates do not allow an accurate analysis of burst pulsed signals. However, taking into account data storage limitations, recording at the highest frequency is not always required for an accurate description of signals and the outcomes of this study improve the accuracy of passive acoustic monitoring systems, thus enhancing the potential for conservation of short-beaked common dolphins. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Two striped dolphins (SD1, SD2), stranded along the Ligurian coast of Italy, were diagnosed with a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis associated with previously undescribed protozoan tissue cysts. As tissue cysts were morphologically different from those of Toxoplasma gondii, additional histopathological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and biomolecular investigations were performed, aiming to fully characterize the organism. Histopathology revealed the presence of large Sarcocystis-like tissue cysts, associated with limited inflammatory lesions in all CNS areas studied. IHC was inconclusive, as positive staining with polyclonal antisera did not preclude crossreaction with other Sarcocystidae coccidia. Applied to each animal, 11 different PCR protocols precluded a neural infection by Sarcocystis neurona, Sarcocystis falcatula, Hammondia hammondi, and Neospora caninum. T. gondii coinfection was confirmed only in dolphin SD2. Sarcocystis sp. sequences, showing the highest homology to species infecting the Bovidae family, were amplified from SD1 myocardium and SD2 skeletal muscle. The present study represents the first report of Sarcocystislike tissue cysts in the brain of stranded cetaceans along with the first description of Sarcocystis sp. infection in muscle tissue of dolphins from the Mediterranean basin. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Preservation of endangered species is now recognized as a relevant component of regional and global conservation actions achieved through the maintenance of the remaining populations in a favourable conservation status. The Mediterranean common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is listed as an Endangered subpopulation in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, with declining numbers in some of the areas where it has been studied for numerous years. Prey depletion, fisheries bycatch, pollution, health risks, and climate change are among the recognized threats that the species is facing in the region. The existing national, regional, and international legislation pertinent to Mediterranean countries should aid greater science–policy–management integration and support innovative research and monitoring towards effective conservation. The challenges inherent in studying the pelagic D. delphis should not preclude the use of long-term, year-round, multiplatform surveys, side by side with the latest molecular tools, which aid our understanding of its populations' genetic diversity, resistance to diseases, and resilience in a semi-enclosed fast-changing sea. Addressing the multiplicity of problems confronting the species requires collaborative effort at all levels to share and merge resources, data, and expertise more efficiently. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the Mediterranean common dolphin, the main threats, and knowledge gaps that are priorities for addressing its conservation, while providing clear recommendations for effectively safeguarding the species and its habitat at both local and regional levels. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Geographic variations in the dolphin whistles could be useful in assessing association and isolation among populations. Whistle of free-ranging Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) among the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), Leizhou Bei (LZB) and Sanniang Bay (SNB) populations were investigated. A total of 2850 whistles with legible fundamental contour were extracted and 15 acoustic parameters were measured. Contrary to SNB, PRE and LZB had the same relative proportion of tonal type compositions with flat and sine representing the most frequent types. The generalized linear model analysis showed significant acoustic difference among populations and tonal types. All frequency parameters in SNB were significantly higher than those in PRE and LZB, where no significant variation was observed in most of the parameters either at the population level or within each tonal type. Canonical discriminant functions analysis showed a smaller difference between PRE and LZB than between PRE and SNB and between LZB and SNB. Compared with previous recordings, recent recordings demonstrated a consistent pattern of becoming higher in whistle frequency parameters in both LZB and SNB populations, suggesting that noise pollution in LZB and SNB increasing with time according to the acoustic niche hypothesis. Dolphin whistle's geographic variations could be shaped by the combined function of the geographical barrier function of the Qiongzhou strait and local ambient noise. Considering the isolated condition and the relatively smaller population size of the humpback dolphin in the SNB, more effective and proactive conservation actions should be taken to prevent the extinction of small populations. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The currently recognized Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin occurs in estuaries and surrounding shallow waters from the South China Sea to the Asian coast of the Indian Ocean. However, a recent study suggested that the humpback dolphin from the Bay of Bengal may represent a distinct phylogenetic species. In this study, we sequenced 915-bp mtDNA segments from five geographic populations in both Chinese and Thai waters; together with previously published sequences, these data revealed that the ancestral Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin might have split during the transition from the Oligocene to Miocene (23.45 Mya, 95% HPD: 16.65–26.55 Mya), and then dispersed along the Pacific and Indian Ocean coasts of Asia. Genetic differentiation was detected between most of the examined populations, except for only a few pairwise populations in the northern South China Sea. Genetic differentiation/distance between the humpback dolphins from the northern and southern South China Sea met the sub-species threshold value proposed for marine mammals, whereas that between the humpback dolphins in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean was above the species threshold. Bayesian inference of historic gene flow indicated low but constant northward gene flow along the Indian Ocean coast; however, there was a recent abrupt increase in gene flow in the Pacific region, likely due to the shortening coastline at the low stand of sea level. Our results revealed that the current taxonomic classification of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins may not reflect their phylogeography. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Blood values of wild cetacean population are a valuable tool to drive proper management of threatened species. Reference intervals of 26 serum analytes were determined from 107 apparently healthy Amazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) wild-caught in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve (3°3′S, 64°51′W), central Amazon, Brazil. No differences were detected between males and females or between pregnant and nonpregnant females. Calves had higher serum calcium than juveniles and adults, and alkaline phosphatase activity was higher in calves and juveniles than adults as a result of bone growth. Adults showed higher creatinine levels than juveniles due to higher body mass, and higher urea than calves. Positive correlation was found between body length and body weight with creatinine, urea, and alanine aminotransferase activity; whereas calcium and alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase (CK) activities negatively correlated with these body parameters. Cardiac rate and respiratory frequency appear to have not correlated with any serum analyte, while stress level positively correlated with CK. Storage of frozen samples for 60 days at −80°C significantly altered 10 of the 19 analytes after one freeze–thaw cycle. Important differences were detected among age classes, stress level, and sample storage and should be taken into account before any clinical or physiological interpretations. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The Natura 2000 network is the centerpiece of the European Union conservation strategy to safeguard priority species and habitats. The question of whether other co-occurring species of conservation concern may also benefit from this network, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used a systematic approach (MARXAN) for i) evaluating if the current Natura 2000 network in the Alboran Sea (western Mediterranean Sea), initially proposed to protect the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and priority habitats, is also spatially protecting the endangered common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), and ii) identifying additional marine areas that should be protected to reach adequate conservation targets for the common dolphin. While the current Natura 2000 network encompass ca. 22% of predicted abundances for common dolphins, this percentage might be enhanced by protecting coastal areas nearby the Strait of Gibraltar. However, dolphins and fisheries largely overlap spatially nearby the coastline, and only segregate in offshore areas that represent the marginal distribution of the species. Thus, conservation decision-makers must achieve a trade-off between cetacean conservation and fisheries by combining an area-based approach (i.e., new protected areas close to the Strait of Gibraltar) together with a basin-wide threat-based approach (e.g., regulation of fisheries). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The abundance, distribution and diet of the short-beaked common dolphin were investigated as part of the first detailed study on cetacean populations in the North Aegean Sea. Since 2004, the area has been proposed by national and international entities as a marine protected area for common dolphins and other cetacean species owing to its high biodiversity. Abundance and distribution were investigated between 2005 and 2013 through dedicated scientific marine transect surveys, covering 14,701 km, in sea conditions of Beaufort sea state 3 and below. The line-transect sampling method was used to estimate relative abundance, using Distance 6.0 software. Encounter rate for this species in the study area was estimated to be 0.24 groups/100 km (1.5 dolphins/100 km), with a mean group size of 6.88 (SE = 1.90). Common dolphin sightings were analysed for correlations with eight environmental variables (distance from the coast, depth, slope, median salinity, gradient of salinity, median temperature, gradient of temperature and mean current) using generalized additive modelling. Common dolphin sightings were significantly correlated to depth, temperature and salinity. Stomach-content analyses were performed on eight suitable samples from common dolphins stranded in the study area. The trophic level of the species was calculated, indicating that this species is a top predator. This research provides the first estimates for abundance and distribution and the first diet analysis for this Mediterranean Endangered dolphin species in the study area based on a year-round long-term study. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The short-beaked common dolphin is one of the most numerous cetacean species in the North-East Atlantic and plays a key functional role within the ecosystem as a top predator. However, in 2013, its conservation status for the European Marine Atlantic, under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive, was assessed as ‘Unfavourable-Inadequate’. Of key concern for this species is fishery bycatch, with pollution also being an issue. There are, however, major knowledge gaps concerning the extent of the effects of such pressures on the species. Implementation of national observer bycatch programmes and bycatch mitigation measures under EC Regulation 812/2004 has been important. The responsibility for this is currently being transferred to the EU fisheries Data Collection Framework and Technical Measures Framework, the potential advantages and disadvantages of which are discussed. Collection of data and samples through national stranding schemes in some countries has enabled assessments of life-history parameters, dietary requirements, and the effects of stressors such as pollutants. Nevertheless, in order to improve the conservation status of the North-East Atlantic population, a number of key actions are still required. These include the implementation of a species action plan, finalization of a management framework procedure for bycatch, and coordination between member states of monitoring programmes. It is important that there is monitoring of the state of the common dolphin population in the North-East Atlantic management unit through regular surveys spanning the range of the management unit, as well as continued assessment of the independent and interactive effects of multiple stressors. Above all, conservation status would be improved through application and enforcement of existing legislation in European waters. This paper provides a summary of the current state of our knowledge of common dolphins in the North-East Atlantic along with recommendations for conservation management that may also be relevant to the species in the Mediterranean Sea. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Existing literature on dolphin-fisheries interaction focused on Greece reveals both an undeveloped area for research, but also a lack of relevant data in this field. Although imperative, relevant research has been slow on innovation and cooperation among universities, official bureaus, and NGOs that are obliged to work together as European and national laws dictate. Most of the research in this new field focuses on the interaction between marine mammals and local fisheries, suggesting that this relationship may be problematic for both parties since the former are being treated (at least occasionally) with brutality, while the latter try to deal with economic loss. Dolphins and fishermen operate within the same ecological niches for their survival, the main area of conflict being nutritious fish. Anthropological research on ethnic identity has long dealt with antagonistic relationships over resources between adjacent groups of people. Marine biologists’ research in Greece focuses on the human factor, and some of its shortcomings may well be seen as the result of limited, or an absence of, training in social sciences. This article attempts to draw from anthropological theory to shed light on a particular symbiosis between humans and dolphins. Multidisciplinary approaches gain ground in a wide range of research interests and seem to be fruitful in terms of theoretical and practical results. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Tursiops truncatus gephyreus is only found in the inshore waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. They are organized in small socially, structured groups, which lead to low genetic variability and high anthropogenic threats. Currently, the information about their reproductive biology and management is still insufficient. Thus, this study aims to present novel information recorded for 20 years regarding reproductive parameters in a small population of captive T. t. gephyreus. Three of the animals involved were found stranded in La Plata River estuary and, the other two were born at the oceanarium. Thirteen semen evaluations showed high-quality semen with a low percentage of sperm abnormalities. Twelve pregnancies and parturitions were observed. There was a clear calving seasonality during austral spring and summer. The duration of phase-2 of labor was approximately 80 min, being the caudal presentation the most frequent. The average inter-birth interval (IBI) was about 33 months. This is the first report that closely monitored parturition, IBI, and seminal evaluation in this species. Information gathered during this program will allow the development of adequate conservation plans for free-ranging populations. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Head morphology in toothed whales evolved under selective pressures on feeding strategy and sound production. The postnatal development of the skull (n = 207) and mandible (n = 219) of six Delphinida species which differ in feeding strategy but exhibit similar sound emission patterns, including two narrow-band high-frequency species, were investigated through 3D morphometrics. Morphological changes throughout ontogeny were demonstrated based on the main source of variation (i.e., prediction lines) and the common allometric component. Multivariate trajectory analysis with pairwise comparisons between all species was performed to evaluate specific differences on the postnatal development of skulls and mandibles. Changes in the rostrum formation contributed to the variation (skull: 49%; mandible: 90%) of the entire data set and might not only reflect the feeding strategy adopted by each lineage but also represents an adaptation for sound production and reception. As an important structure for directionality of sound emissions, this may increase directionality in raptorial feeders. Phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses indicated that shape of the anterior portion of the skull is strongly dependent on phylogeny and might not only reflect feeding mode, but also morphological adaptations for sound production, particularly in raptorial species. Thus, postnatal development seems to represent a crucial stage for biosonar maturation in some raptorial species such as Pontoporia blainvillei and Sousa plumbea. The ontogeny of their main tool for navigation and hunting might reflect their natural history peculiarities and thus potentially define their main vulnerabilities to anthropogenic changes in the environment. © 2020 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: Delphinids exhibit great variability in their social structures. It is therefore important to document lesser known species, in extreme changing habitats, to compare and contrast mechanisms driving sociality. Here, we describe the first long-term assessment of social structure of white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) using a compiled version of SOCPROG 2.8 and an 11-year photo-identification dataset (2002–2013) collected from whale-watching vessels at 2 sites (Faxaflói and Skjálfandi bays) off Iceland. We identified a total of 487 dolphins which are suggested to be part of an open population as shown by the discovery curve obtained analyzing photo-id data. The social analyses were restricted to 35 adults which were sighted on ≥5 different days. The mean residency time of white-beaked dolphins in our 2 study areas was of 95 days (SE = 35.63; 95% CI: 23–171), with the “migration-full interchange” model best describing movements of dolphins in and out of our 2 study sites. Social differentiation in this population was high (Likelihood: S = 0.87, SE = 0.04; r = 0.31, SE = 0.03) indicating diverse, non-random social relationships. Temporal associations best fit the model of “casual acquaintances” against the standardized lagged association rates with the majority of white-beaked dolphin associations being short-term, but with a few long-term across years. Testing for preferred companionship, long-term associations are favored over short-term. In this study, associations among white-beaked dolphins are short-term but with desirably long-term associations fitting into a society with fission–fusion dynamics. This information expands the latitudinal range for which social structure has been described for oceanic dolphin species. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Mediterranean common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), considered to have been very common in the past, had undergone a dramatic decline across most of the basin by the end of 1970s. In the northern Adriatic Sea, one of the regions with most available historical information, the common dolphin is thought to have been the most common and abundant cetacean throughout most of the 20th century. However, by the end of 1970s, it had virtually disappeared from the region and is now considered generally absent from the entire Adriatic Sea. This contribution summarizes the occurrence of common dolphins in the Gulf of Trieste and provides a brief review of published records in other parts of the Adriatic Sea. Systematic boat surveys in the wider area of the Gulf of Trieste between 2002 and 2019 confirmed that the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the only regularly occurring cetacean species in this area. Despite this, several records of common dolphins were documented in the Gulf of Trieste between 2009 and 2012, through sightings of live animals or recovery of dead stranded animals. Dorsal fin markings allowed the photo-identification of some of these, suggesting that at least four different live individuals (three adults and one calf) occurred here in recent times. Most cases involved single adult individuals, but one included a mother-calf pair that was temporarily resident in a port for several months, a behaviour atypical for this species. Photo-identification showed that the presumed mother had previously been sighted in the Ionian Sea in Greece, over 1,000 km from the Gulf of Trieste, making this the longest documented movement for this species worldwide. At present, the common dolphin continues to be rare in the region. © 2020 The Authors. Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to protect the marine environment and marine biodiversity across Europe more effectively. In the present study, the predicted distribution of striped dolphins of the Gulf of Corinth (Greece) is investigated for the first two periods of the MSFD (I: 2007-2012; II: 2013-2018). For the first time, anthropogenic variables are included in the striped dolphin distribution analysis, resulting from accounting for most of the variability. The results show that the predicted distribution is similar for both investigated periods. However, a small reduction of suitable areas in the Northern portion of the Gulf is observable for the second one, probably due to the expansion of fish farm activity in this zone. The MSFD and its consequent management actions didn't appear to improve the protection of striped dolphins in the investigated area. Their review will be essential to assess which further management actions will be necessary to program to protect and conserve striped dolphins in the Natura 2000 area 'Gulf of Corinth'. The present study shows that human activities are important for explaining stripe dolphins distribution and that their further development needs to be carefully taken into account while managing spatial planning. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a cosmopolitan species inhabiting tropical and temperate waters. Some populations of coastal bottlenose dolphin (both T. truncatus and Tursiops aduncus) are among the better studied cetacean societies. Living within semi-discrete population units, both species organize in fission—fusion societies where kinship, age, sex, reproductive status, and ecological features modulate the interactions among their members (Wells et al., 1987; McHugh, 2019; Connor et al., 2000). Long-term studies have attempted to decode the complex bottlenose dolphin societies in different parts of the world by monitoring known animals at different life stages; this has provided details of the diverse roles individuals play within dolphin society (Wells, 2014; Connor et al., 2019). Adult females play an important role within the bottlenose dolphin society that is not limited to their reproductive phase but probably extends into senescence when their experience and knowledge would become valuable societal assets, similar to other long-lived mammals (e.g., McComb et al., 2001; Foster et al., 2012). For some populations, male bottlenose dolphins maintain long-lasting associations with other males to improve status and access to receptive females (Wells et al., 1987; Connor et al., 1992). In such complex societies, effective bonds created in early devel opment likely exceed those benefits associated with defense, food procurement, and reproduction (Stanton & Mann, 2012). © 2021, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: In fragile environments that are already seriously threatened, such as the city of Taranto and its Gulf, special attention and the involvement of all stakeholders is required (Selby and Morgan in Tour Manag 17(4): 287-294, 1996). In these destinations, tourist experiences and resources have the potential to become instruments to increase visitors’ environmental consciousness, increasing the awareness about the value of biodiversity and the importance of its conservation. Today Taranto is struggling to overcome the negative image associate with an Ilva steel plant by enhancing its natural resources. The Jonian Dolphin Conservation, an association that carries on activities of research and protection of the sea and cetaceans in the Gulf of Taranto, operates in these directions and represents an essential example of blue economy enterprise and a sustainable way to exploit sea resources. This paper aims to study how an environmentally sustainable activity can favour tourism development and urban repositing in a place affected by a negative image. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

ABSTRACT: Background and objectives: Ischemic events, such as ischemic heart disease and stroke, are the number one cause of death globally. Ischemia prevents blood, carrying essential nutrients and oxygen, from reaching tissues, leading to cell and tissue death, and eventual organ failure. While humans are relatively intolerant to ischemic events, other species, such as marine mammals, have evolved a unique tolerance to chronic ischemia/reperfusion during apneic diving. To identify possible molecular features of an increased tolerance for apnea, we examined changes in gene expression in breath-holding dolphins. Methodology: Here, we capitalized on the adaptations possesed by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) for diving as a comparative model of ischemic stress and hypoxia tolerance to identify molecular features associated with breath holding. Given that signals in the blood may influence physiological changes during diving, we used RNA-Seq and enzyme assays to examine time-dependent changes in gene expression in the blood of breath-holding dolphins. Results: We observed time-dependent upregulation of the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) gene and increased lipoxygenase activity during breath holding. ALOX5 has been shown to be activated during hypoxia in rodent models, and its metabolites, leukotrienes, induce vasoconstriction. Conclusions and implications: The upregulation of ALOX5 mRNA occurred within the calculated aerobic dive limit of the species, suggesting that ALOX5 may play a role in the dolphin's physiological response to diving, particularly in a pro-inflammatory response to ischemia and in promoting vasoconstriction. These observations pinpoint a potential molecular mechanism by which dolphins, and perhaps other marine mammals, respond to the prolonged breath holds associated with diving. © The Author(s) 2021

ABSTRACT: Among the many factors that influence the cardiovascular adjustments of marine mammals is the act of respiration at the surface, which facilitates rapid gas exchange and tissue re-perfusion between dives. We measured heart rate (fH) in six adult male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) spontaneously breathing at the surface to quantify the relationship between respiration and fH, and compared this with fH during submerged breath-holds. We found that dolphins exhibit a pronounced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during surface breathing, resulting in a rapid increase in fH after a breath followed by a gradual decrease over the following 15-20 s to a steady fH that is maintained until the following breath. RSA resulted in a maximum instantaneous fH (ifH) of 87.4±13.6 beatsmin-1 and a minimum ifH of 56.8±14.8 beats min-1, and the degree of RSA was positively correlated with the inter-breath interval (IBI). The minimum ifH during 2 min submerged breath-holds where dolphins exhibited submersion bradycardia (36.4±9.0 beats min-1) was lower than the minimum ifH observed during an average IBI; however, during IBIs longer than 30 s, the minimum ifH (38.7±10.6 beats min-1) was not significantly different fromthat during 2 min breath-holds.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins’ whistles are key in social communication, conveying information about conspecifics and the environment. Therefore, their study can help to infer habitat use and identify areas of concern due to human activities. Here we studied the whistles of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in two sites of the archipelago of Bocas del Toro, Panama, that contrast in boat traffic. Almirante Bay is a site dominated by taxi-boats and Dolphin Bay is a major location for boat-based dolphin watching. Recordings were made using bottom-mounted hydrophones and from the research boat using an over-the-side hydrophone and a broadband recording system. A total recording effort time of 1,726 h was analyzed. Our results show significant differences in boat detection between sites, and a higher number of whistles detected per minute in the site with tour-boat traffic. Furthermore, whistle modulation accounted for most of the differences between sites, boat presence, and whistle types. Dolphin whistle modulation is thought to be a potential indicator of emotional states including danger, alertness, and stress. In this study, dolphin signature whistle modulation increased significantly with boat presence in both sites but changes in modulation were greater in Dolphin Bay where tour-boats directly and sometimes aggressively interact with the animals. These results support a potential association between whistle modulation and stress (or alertness). These findings indicate that if tour-boat captains behave more like taxi-boat captains by e.g., reducing the distance of approach and contact time during dolphin interactions, dolphin communication, and emotional state would be less disrupted. These measures are implemented in the national guidelines for whale-watching and are known to tour-boat operators. The key to protecting these dolphins is in finding ways to effectively enforce these operator guidelines. © Copyright © 2021 Perez-Ortega, Daw, Paradee, Gimbrere and May-Collado.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is the most threatened small cetacean in the South Atlantic. In this study we report the development of 13 microsatellite markers for franciscanas through next-generation sequencing, and the characterization of those loci in 38 samples from the species’ northernmost population (Espírito Santo, Brazil). Besides providing diversity indices for the new, specific loci, we also report on the transferability of heterologous loci which had not been screened in franciscanas before, and review all loci used in previous studies. Expected heterozygosity in the new loci ranged between 0.107 and 0.595, and all but one were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. These are the first microsatellite loci isolated from franciscanas, and they are an important addition to heterologous markers that were available previously. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The population of short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis of the Bay of Biscay (northeast Atlantic) has been subjected to potentially dangerous levels of bycatch since the 1990s. As the phenomenon intensifies, it represents a potent threat to the population. Here, we investigated the relationship between bycatch mortality and oceanographic processes. We as - sumed that oceanographic processes spatiotemporally structure the availability and aggregation of prey, creating areas prone to attract both common dolphins and fish targeted by fisheries. We used 2 datasets from 2012 to 2019: oceanographic data resulting from a circulation model and mortality data inferred from strandings. The latter allows location of mortality areas and quantification of the intensity of mortality events at sea. We fitted a series of spatiotemporal hierarchical Bayesian models using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). Results provided first insights on how bycatch of common dolphins in the Bay of Biscay might be related to key seasonal and dynamic oceanographic features. We showed that from a statistical predictive point of view, the monthly trend of 2019 bycatch mortality could be predicted with few oceanographic covariates. This study highlights how gaining knowledge about environmental influences on interactions between short-beaked common dolphins and fisheries could have great conservation and management value. Identified relationships with oceanographic covariates were complex, as expected given the dynamic aspects of oceanographic processes, dolphins and fisheries distributions. Further research focusing on smaller time scales is needed to elucidate proximal drivers of common dolphin bycatch in the Bay of Biscay. © 2021 Inter-Research. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins emit a probing pulse and receive an echo pulse for echolocation during hunting, on the basis of which they detect and identify their prey in the search phase. In the capture phase, dolphins require a stable auditory response to the echo pulse. To explain the features of the perception of echo pulses in the search and capture phases, the pulse-induced response of an ensemble of high-frequency peripheral fibers was modeled. A pair of pulses with center frequencies of 70 kHz, different inter-pulse intervals and peak amplitudes was a model of a probing pulse and an echo pulse. The pulses entered the model at different processing steps, including the transformation of the receptor potential of inner hair cells into a sequence of action potentials of an ensemble of auditory nerve fibers. It was shown that in order to reproduce the temporal structure of the pulses in the ensemble response, the resulting receptor potential must correspond to the response thresholds of most of the ensemble fibers. At short intervals between pulses in a pair, the reproduction of the temporal structure of the second pulse (echo pulse) was facilitated by an increase in the response thresholds of the fibers of the ensemble due to the refractory properties caused by the action of the first pulse (probe pulse model). At large intervals between pulses in a pair, variations in the peak amplitudes of the first pulse (probing pulse models) could be responsible for the reproduction of the structure of the second pulse (echo pulse). It was shown that the modeling is a convenient means to identify different ways of the adjustment of echo pulses to the auditory sensitivity of dolphins in the phases of searching for and capturing prey. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The knowledge of demographic traits such as longevity, growth rates and age at sexual maturity is crucial for understanding the structure of a population in its natural environment and implementing appropriate strategies for its management and conservation. Based on counts of growth layer groups in sections of decalcified teeth using the paraffin technique, we estimated the age and growth of 25 individuals of striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) found dead stranded along the coast of Campania and Calabria (south Italy, central-western Mediterranean) from 2013 to 2018. Seven individuals, with TL of 100–110 cm, were calves under 1 year old. The oldest male and female individuals were 19 and 14 years old, respectively. Growth curve estimated using the Gompertz growth model (GGM) showed that in S. coeruleoalba male growth trajectories are partly in accordance with those reported in other studies on the same species from different Mediterranean areas. The high frequency (28%) of calves strongly suggests that females of this species use the marine area all around the south-western Italian coasts to give birth to their offspring. Furthermore, a comparison with the estimated age of striped dolphins from other Mediterranean marine areas shows that the longevity of the individuals examined in this study is much lower. Our study provides information toward understanding the demographic traits of S. coeruleoalba from Mediterranean Sea. The results reported here can be useful for future research aimed at understanding population structure, mortality patterns and the effects of anthropogenic activity on the survival of this species in this marine area. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Two cyanobacterial strains, one collected from an epidermal mat present on a dead bottlenose dolphin and the other as a bioaerosol 457 m (1500 ft) above the river, were recently analysed from the St. Johns River, Jacksonville, Florida, USA. Both samples had major phenotypic plasticity which confused morphological identification. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from the isolates revealed that both samples were closely aligned (branch bootstrap support = 100%) with the recently erected genus Komarekiella. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic construction also supported the isolation of a new species of cyanobacteria branching from the Nostoc clade. A total evidence approach of molecular, genetic, and ecological examination of these strains supported the erection of a new species, Komarekiella delphini-convector. A prior study determined that the dolphin with the epidermal mat had low levels of microcystins/nodularins (MCs/NODs) in the hepatic tissue. To investigate whether these toxins originated from the epidermal mat, immunoassay (ELISA) and 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB) techniques were conducted on the original mat and subsequent culture samples. The results from both analyses were not conclusive. Genome mining was conducted and revealed diverse biosynthetic capabilities of this species but could not support toxin-producing potential. Further analytical work is required to determine the pathogenic capacity of this epizoic species. © 2021 International Phycological Society.

ABSTRACT: The use of light-falling nets is an important fishing method in the South China Sea. Pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) often gather around fishing vessels using light-falling nets for predatory activities at night, leading to accidental injuries and even death. In this study, we used a wide-band acoustic system to deter pantropical spotted dolphins from the fishing vessels. After two tests, the effective deterrent frequency was deter-mined, and the deterrent effect was quantitatively evaluated. The results indicate that a 1–10 kHz linear frequency modulation signal could deter pantropical spotted dolphins. The number of dolphin signals and the average dis-tance between dolphins and vessels were greater after the signal launch. On May 28, no suspected dolphin signals were detected at the three thresholds. In addition, by analyzing and comparing the nautical area scattering coeffi-cient (NASC) value of each cell in the vertical acoustic ecogram, we found that there were significant differences in the NASC values of each cell before and after the dolphin deterrent was applied (P<0.05), and the mean NASC value was larger after the deterrent was used. This study has verified the effectiveness of a wide-band acoustic dolphin deterrent system, and established a preliminary protection method for the pantropical spotted dolphin in the light-falling net fisheries in the South China Sea. However, this study has some limitations, and further studies are needed to improve this method in the future. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: The evaluation of acoustic temporal rhythms in wide-ranging cetaceans can reveal patterns in animal spatial presence and the occurrence of periodical phenomena. Here, we aimed at assessing the temporal patterns of dolphin’s acoustic presence in a shallow-water area in the Sicily Strait (Mediterranean Sea). Whistles were collected continuously for 14 months from an acoustic monitoring station installed aboard of an elastic seamark. Over a total of 6955 h of recording, 14,048 signals were identified using both automatic and visual methods. Three parameters were analyzed: hourly presence (HP), used as a proxy of the presence of dolphins in the area; detection rate (DR), indicating the acoustic activity rate of dolphins measured per hour in the entire dataset; and detection rate in presence of dolphins (DRD), indicating the acoustic activity rate of dolphins considering only the hours when whistles were recorded. The highest values of both HP and DR were reached during the night, and the Autumn and Winter months, suggesting an increase in the dolphin’s occurrence and a possible moving away and towards the monitoring station potentially following prey. DRD, instead, showed an almost uniform distribution throughout the day implying that when the animals are close to the monitoring station, the acoustic activity does not show any pattern. However, possible changes in the communication exchange along the seasons were suggested. This study complements other work on this subject, improving the knowledge of dolphins’ acoustic activity in the area. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The threats to South Asian river dolphins (genus Platanista: the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica) and the Indus river dolphin (P.g. minor) are myriad. Habitat alteration, degradation and loss affects the entire range of the species across all four range states. Discussion and deliberations within the Scientific Committee (SC) led to the formation of a Task Team, in 2017, to assess emerging issues from across the species’ range. The IWC creates task teams to provide timely advice on situations where populations of cetaceans are known or suspected to be in danger of significant decline that could lead to extirpation or extinction, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that this does not occur. The Asian River Dolphin Task Team (AR-TT), convened by Sutaria and Kelkar, invited a group of river dolphin researchers to meet in an intersessional workshop to discuss progress towards achieving the AR-TT aims. A key objective of this workshop was to develop a trans-national plan that coordinated research efforts among range states and regions. In particular, the workshop aimed to: (a) identify information gaps and research priorities for South Asian river dolphin populations; (b) identify research projects that require coordinated effort and sharing of expertise; (c) identify key threats across the entire range of the species and any region, or country-specific threats; and (d) communicate the results of the workshop to government agencies and other bodies concerned with river wildlife conservation. The workshop was held between 19-21 July 2019 at the University of Nottingham, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and was attended by members of the IWC SC and river dolphin experts from each range state – Bangladesh, India, Nepal and India. A review of the species’ taxonomy indicate that two independent lines of evidence, morphological and mitochondrial, strongly suggest that the two subspecies currently recognised should be elevated to species status. The workshop supported the proposed taxonomic revision based on the evidence presented. Updates of population status were presented from each of the range states and it became apparent from the country updates that a substantial part of the dolphins’ habitat (>80%) had been altered by river flow regulation measures or construction. Overall, mortality as a result of bycatch was recognised as the second greatest threat to river dolphins, following habitat fragmentation. Five themes were discussed in detail: dams, hydro-climatic change and water availability; population surveys and ecological modelling approaches; dolphin bycatch; other types of interactions with fisheries; and human use of the animals (aquatic wildmeat) – all with the goal of identifying practical conservation solutions and emerging issues. Following the deliberations of this workshop, the South Asian River Dolphin Task Team recommended that: • By 2022, all range states identify key sections of national habitat that should be surveyed every five years, so that population trends can be monitored. Methodology should be replicated in each identified habitat but need not be standardised throughout the range, as different habitats require different methodological adaptations. This recommendation is targeted at the following: - Pakistan: WWF Pakistan, Punjab Wildlife Department, Sindh Wildlife Department and KPK Wildlife Department – coordinated through WWF Pakistan. - Nepal: Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, Department of Forest and Soil Conservation, WWF Nepal, Institute of Forestry Pokhara and Hetauda Campus, University of Tribhuvan (co-ordinated by Shambhu Paudel and Usha Thakuri). - Bangladesh: Forestry Department and WCS. - India: India’s Conservation Action Plan for Ganges dolphins, State Forest Departments. • All existing survey methods in use for population estimation be reviewed, and a decision system prepared to guide monitoring agencies and conservationists to identify and implement statistically robust and optimal survey methods based on river conditions and available survey resources. • Starting from 2020, surveys to establish population size be initiated as early as possible in the Padma, Jamuna and Meghna mainstems and tributary networks (excluding the Bangladesh Sundarbans), Bangladesh and the Budhi Gandak, Baghmati, Rapti and Mahananda, India. • The review of Platanista taxonomy be completed and published. • As a priority, studies be conducted to better understand movements of dolphins across barrages in all countries and quantify the extent of population connectivity and impacts on dolphin populations in fragmented riverine habitats. • Pingers be assessed as an effective tool, both to minimise bycatch and to reduce the risk of dolphins becoming strand in canals. • A feasibility study be conducted to assess areas and methods to translocate Indus River dolphins (WWF-Pakistan) and to adapt existing marine mammal translocation initiatives specifically for river dolphins (co-ordinated by the Society for Marine Mammalogy and IUCN). • As a priority and with data currently available, assess the level of dolphin bycatch throughout the species’ range and evaluate its impact on local populations. From the outcomes of this assessment, provide recommendations for future monitoring and actions to mitigate impacts, ranging from technical changes to the revision of fisheries policies. • Assessment be undertaken of the extent of targeted take and the use of dolphins for oil and as wildmeat, particularly in India and Bangladesh, by involving social and ecological scientists – as part of co-ordinated survey actions listed above. In conclusion, the AR-TT members agreed to start working towards fulfilling these recommendations through compiling data sets, taking forward ideas for joint and collaborative work, and planning additional workshops to fill the identified information gaps and research needs for each country. The AR-TT agreed to report progress on its actions to the Task Team Steering Committee intersessionally. © 2021 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Several kinds of animals are utilized in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) for humans, which release stress and/or provide motivation for muscle movement. It is important to monitor AAI animals’ stress levels to ensure their welfare. In the present study, we analyzed blood cortisol levels to evaluate the stress levels of Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in a dolphin interactive program (DIP). We sampled nine female dolphins that were used in the DIP in Motobu Genki village, Okinawa, Japan. Plasma cortisol levels were measured by ELISA, and the data were analyzed by comparing differences between seasons and before and after the DIPs on a given day. The average plasma cortisol level was 8.7±5.0 ng/ml and ranged from 1.6–29.3 ng/ml. Comparing before and after the DIP sessions on a given day, the average cortisol level of five dolphins decreased significantly. In comparison among seasons, average cortisol levels were significantly higher in the high visitor season than in the rising transition season (between the low and high visitor seasons) in two out of three animals. Regarding the falling transition season (between the high and low visitor seasons), two out of three animals tended to remain high in cortisol levels. From these results, we conclude that DIP induced little acute stress on dolphins. On the other hand, we showed the possibility of chronic stress in DIP-participating dolphins in the high visitor season. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether dolphins experience chronic stress by combining cortisol sampling with stress behavior monitoring. © 2021, Hokkaido University. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Small cetaceans face persistent threats from fisheries interactions, making effective mitigation a priority for conservation. In southwest Florida, interactions come primarily from small-scale recreational hook and line and trap/pot fisheries, with regional stranding network partners working with federal agency managers to assess and intervene as possible in cases of live animal entanglement. Evaluating success of intervention cases is difficult due to financial and logistical constraints which may preclude detailed follow-up monitoring. Survival over the initial 6 weeks post-release has been used as a marker of short-term success for small-cetacean rescue and/or rehabilitation cases. Early intervention prior to stranding, especially via remote disentanglement or rescue and immediate re-release onsite, can save entangled free-ranging dolphins facing life-threatening anthropogenic injuries. However, given the costs associated with interventions, it is important to understand the benefits of these endeavors not only to save individuals, but also to establish if and how saved individuals contribute to social functioning, survival and reproduction within small, resident populations facing multiple concurrent threats. Here we provide evidence from 27 well-documented common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) intervention cases during 1985–2019 where follow-up monitoring over multiple years sheds light on the longer-term success of these efforts and potential benefits to local populations. Nearly all rescued individuals (92%) survived longer than 6 weeks post-release (mean minimum survival period = 5 years, range 0–35 years), with 13 still observed frequently within their prior resident communities, in good physical health, and engaging in normal behavior. Survivorship rates did not decline substantially between 1 and 5 years post-rescue, meaning survival beyond 1 year may be a useful benchmark of long-term success. Rescued females that reached reproductive maturity (n = 4) have produced 12 post-intervention offspring to date. Social network analysis and demographic modeling applied to cases from the long-term resident community in Sarasota Bay confirmed that animals maintain social connections post-intervention and that interventions result in higher population growth rates. While not every intervention succeeds, this study demonstrates the conservation value of pre-stranding interventions which allow individuals that otherwise would be lost to remain viable and productive members of local populations when prevention of anthropogenic injury is not possible. © Copyright © 2021 McHugh, Barleycorn, Allen, Bassos-Hull, Lovewell, Boyd, Panike, Cush, Fauquier, Mase, Lacy, Greenfield, Rubenstein, Weaver, Stone, Oliver, Morse and Wells.

ABSTRACT: Identifying population structure and boundaries among communities of wildlife exposed to anthropogenic threats is key to successful conservation management. Previous studies on the demography, social and spatial structure of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) suggested four nearly discrete behavioral communities in Perth metropolitan waters, Western Australia. We investigated the genetic structure of these four communities using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and part of the hypervariable segment of the mitochondrial control region. Overall, there was no evidence of spatial genetic structure. We found significant, yet very small genetic differentiation between some communities, most likely due to the presence of highly related individuals within these communities. Our findings of high levels of contemporary migration and highly related individuals among communities point toward a panmictic genetic population with continuous gene flow among each of the communities. In species with slow life histories and fission-fusion dynamics, such as Tursiops spp., genetic and socio-spatial structures may reflect different timescales. Thus, despite genetic similarity, each social community should be considered as a distinct ecological unit to be conserved because they are exposed to different anthropogenic threats and occur in different ecological habitats, social structure being as important as genetic information for immediate conservation management. The estuarine community, in particular, is highly vulnerable and appropriate conservation measures are needed in order to maintain its connectivity with the adjacent, semi-enclosed coastal communities. © Copyright © 2021 Chabanne, Allen, Sherwin, Finn and Krützen.

ABSTRACT: PBDEs, HBCD, novel DBDPE, PBEB and HBB, dechloranes, OPFRs and natural MeO-PBDEs were monitored in muscle of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) from the Mediterranean Sea collected in three time periods (1990, 2004–2009 and 2014–2018). PBDEs levels decreased about 60% in under three decades, from 5067 ± 2210 to 2068 ± 2642 ng g−1 lw, evidencing the success of their ban. Most PBDEs were found in all the samples, with BDE-47, -99, -154, -100 and -153 as the main contributors. Found in 71.4% of the samples, α-HBCD was stable through time and usually <LOQ. DBDPE concentrations decreased by 89% from 1990 to 2004–2009 and have remained stable since. HBB occurred rarely and decreased by 94% to a current few ng g−1 lw. Dec 602 was the main dechlorane with stable concentrations around 1200 ng g−1 lw, but a declining trend might have started in the last years. OPFRs concentrations were stable and showed the highest concentrations of all FRs in 2014–2018: 6253 ± 11,293 ng g−1 lw. TBOEP and TNBP contributed to most of the OPFR concentration, the former with decreasing levels by 96%. MeO-PBDEs showed mean concentrations between 600 and 700 ng g−1 lw in all periods. Non-targeted analysis allowed the identification and semi-quantification of additional chlorinated pollutants, such as polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs) (levels decreasing by 81% to a current 770 ng g−1 lw mean) and polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs) (decreasing by 83% to a current 3200 ng g−1 lw) in Mediterranean marine mammals for the first time. © 2020

ABSTRACT: Several studies indicate that unregulated nautical tourism can have negative implications on cetacean behaviour. In recent years, dolphin watching activities (DWA) have increased off the West coast of Istria, Croatia, a region in which the NATURA 2000 site: “Akvatorij zapadne Istre” has been proposed to be designated for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus M.). For data collected between 2016 and 2019, we compared dolphin group behaviours from this region during impact (presence of nautical tourism boats-NTBs) and control (absence of NTBs) scenarios, as well as providing descriptive analysis on the displacement of individuals in the presence of NTBs. Throughout the study years, 48.5% of NTBs were observed within 15m of the dolphin focal groups and 97% were observed within 50 m distance. The greatest rates of displacement in dolphin focal groups occurred when NTB numbers were greatest per individual dolphin. Markov chain analyses were used to quantify the short-term effects of NTB presence on dolphin behaviour. In the presence of NTBs, dolphins were more likely to spend time milling and less time foraging. Cumulative behavioural budgets, derived by accounting for the time bottlenose dolphins spent in the presence or absence of NTBs, indicated that vessel exposure levels of 14% and 25% were enough to statistically affect milling and foraging behaviours, respectively. To lessen the lack of sustainable DWA, the implementation of relevant guidelines, e.g., Global Best Practice Guidance for Responsible Whale and Dolphin Watching (50 m no approach and 300 m caution zone) is therefore crucial to mitigate any longterm consequences the actions of NTBs may have on this key species. To date, 162 bottlenose dolphins have been photo-identified off West coast of Istria and cumulative interference to this population could affect direct ecosystem functioning. © 2021

ABSTRACT: In recent decades, there have been some changes in the salinity, quality, and average temperature of the Black Sea water. Among other modifications, there was a significant decrease in the dolphin population on the Romanian coast. The decrease in the number of species Tursios trucantus ponticus, Delphinus delphis ponticus, and Phoococena phocoena relicata species found in this area required more detailed research to obtain information about their living conditions and migration. Located at the top of the ecological pyramid, a dolphin accumulates inappropriate changes from the food chain and bears the consequences of human activities such as pollution, maritime traffic, fishing, and coastal urbanization. Measurements were made on the quality of sea water, in different analysis points for the entire Romanian coast, between Vama-Veche and Sulina, for depths between 0-40 m. Dolphin migration depends mainly on the migration and distribution of their food. The influence of non-biotic and biotic factors, especially of the new invasive species of large poisonous jellyfish, was analyzed. Viral infections and diseases caused by bacteria and micro-algae, and fungal infections were detected in dolphins found dead on the beaches on the Romanian coast. The influence of anthropogenic factors responsible for cetacean habitat degradation was also studied. The migration of fish, which is the food of dolphins and their changes of routes due to the many fishing or pleasure boats in recent years, affects the live of dolphins. A spatial distribution of living areas, migration routes, and determined causes responsible for the decrease in their number (diseases, catches, etc.) was established. Some conditions regarding group life, preferred habitats and the impact of commercial vessels on the areas where dolphins give birth to their young have been determined. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

ABSTRACT: Social behavior is an important driver of infection dynamics, though identifying the social interactions that foster infectious disease transmission is challenging. Here we examine how social behavior impacts disease transmission in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) using an easily identifiable skin disease and social network data. We analyzed tattoo skin disease (TSD) lesions based on photographs collected as part of a 34-year longitudinal study in relation to the sociality of T. aduncus using three metrics (degree, time spent socializing, and time in groups) and network structure, using the k-test. We show that calves with TSD in the second year of life associated more with TSD-positive individuals in the first year of life compared with calves that did not have TSD Additionally, the network k-test showed that the social network links are epidemiologically relevant for transmission. However, degree time spent in groups, and time spent socializing were not significantly different between infected and uninfected groups. Our findings indicate that association with infected individuals is predictive of an individual’s risk for TSD and that the social association network can serve as a proxy for studying the epidemiology of skin diseases in bottlenose dolphins. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Background: Renal cystic diseases (RCD) are characterized by cystic structures on renal parenchyma associated with obstructive lesions, membranous disruptions, and/or growth disturbances. The polycystic kidney disease (PKD) shows specific pathological characteristics, related to mutations on PKD1 and/or PKD2 chromosome locus on humans. In Persian cats and bull terriers the condition is like the human “adult-onset” PKD, while in Perendale sheep the “childhood”-like is described. In cetaceans, RCD are reported, however the characterization of PKD is scarcely described. This report aims to describe two cases of PKD and one of RCD in stranded Steno bredanensis, and to discuss the disease associated factors. Cases: Four rough-toothed-dolphins were found stranded in the Paraná coast, southern Brazil between 2016 to 2018, through the Santos Basin Beach Monitoring Project (PMP-BS), one of the systematic monitoring programs required by Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) for the environmental licensing process of oil production and transport by Petrobras in the presalt province. In three animals histological sampling was performed. One of them (animal 3) was found alive, presenting altered buoyancy with lateralization to the right and signs of pneumonia. The blood analysis showed anemia and leukocytosis. The animal showed poor clinical prognosis, and even with supportive treatment, come to death four days after the rescue. Routine autopsies were performed on all animals. Animals 1 and 2 presented macroscopically enlarged kidneys containing disseminated cystic structures in the parenchyma. On microscopic examination, the cortical region showed diffuse cystic structures delimited by variable thickness of fibrous tissue, usually compressing adjacent glomeruli, without concomitant inflammatory process. In these cases, the death was associated with the end stage renal disease. Animal 3 showed grossly few cystic structures, well delimited and replacing some reniculi. Tracheitis, granulomatous pneumonia, esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis and papilloma on penis and palate were observed. Microscopically, the cysts were lined by a single layer of columnar to cuboidal epithelial cells surrounded by extensive fibrotic tissue. Multifocal tubular necrosis was also noticed. Multifocal moderate nonsuppurative encephalitis with parasitic eggs and bacterial granulomatous hemorrhagic pneumonia were observed. In this case, the death was associated with the lesions in the nervous system. Discussion: Data concerning polycystic kidney disease on cetaceans and wild animals is limited, and no primary genetic pathway was associated. In the present study, the gross and histological aspects observed on two animals (1 and 2) are similar to the characteristics found in the human adult form of PKD, while the characteristics observed on animal 3 are consistent with usual cystic disease. In addition, the animals are aged like humans where the end stage renal disease occurs in patients around 70 years old. The kidney histological aspects observed in all animals are similar, however, animal 3 showed no renomegaly, a characteristic of PKD. Considering the genetic pathway involved in humans and some animal’s breeds, investigation on gene mutations in S. bredanensis could help to define if this is also a genetic disorder and increase the knowledge about PKD. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ABSTRACT: Understanding population structure and habitat use of poorly known cetacean species is a first step toward scientifically informed management decisions. In the southern range of New Caledonia (South Pacific), a long-term dataset of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) encounters primarily during winter seasons 1997 to 2019 (473 group observations) was used to assess social structure, habitat use and potential threats. A total of 338 individuals were photographically identified, forming three distinct communities in the south-west lagoon, the south lagoon and the Isle of Pines. Mark-recapture histories revealed that the three communities were weakly connected and might be considered as independent management units. Suitable habitats were estimated with presence-only distribution models relative to topographic and seabed substrate predictors. Habitat suitability increased with proximity to coasts or reefs, at shallow depth, and over muddy bottom. These habitats had various levels of protection and were used by humans, mostly in the south-west lagoon. External injuries were interpreted to determine natural interactions and potential anthropogenic threats. The prevalence in injuries did not vary among the three areas. A substantial proportion of injuries related to propeller hits was reported, representing a total of 16.7% (34 of 204) of all injuries observed on dolphins. The three communities of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins revealed in the southern part of New Caledonia are particularly vulnerable due to their insularity, their coastal habitat use and the low levels of connectivity found among them. In a context of increasing maritime traffic, fishing and recreational activities, this study provides a useful baseline to the urgent assessment of the conservation status of dolphins in New Caledonia. © Copyright © 2021 Bonneville, Derville, Luksenburg, Oremus and Garrigue.

ABSTRACT: Helicobacter delphinicola (del.phi.ni’co.la.; L. masc. n. delphinus dolphin; L. suff. -cola [from L. masc. or fem. n. incola] dweller; N. L. masc. n. delphinicola dolphin dweller). Cells are Gram-negative, non-sporulating, gently curved rods, approximately 0.5 μm wide and 5 μm long. Coccoid cells were observed in old cultures. Cells were motile with 2 to 6 bipolar, sheathed flagella and no periplasmic fibrils. Colonies on blood agar incubated in micro-aerobic conditions at 37°C for 48−96 h are 2−5 mm in diameter, translucent, α-hemolytic, and circular with an entire margin and low convex profile. Swarming on solid media was not noted. Cells were unable to grow at 42°C. Growth was observed on media supplemented with 2% NaCl. Oxidase, catalase, urease, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activities were observed, but nitrate reduction, indoxyl acetate hydrolysis, alkaline phosphatase, hippuricase, and TTC reduction were not observed. Cells were susceptible to cefalotin and nalidixic acid. The clinical significance of H. delphinicola is unknown. The type strain is TSBT (= JCM 32789T = ATCC TSD-183T), isolated from the gastric fluid of dolphins with gastric diseases. © 2020 Inter-Research. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Estimating population parameters such as survival and population growth is critical for the monitoring of at-risk populations of marine mammals. We conducted monthly boat-based photo-identification surveys in the Mississippi Sound and eastern Louisiana waters during January 2011-June 2015 to assess the status of the Mississippi Sound, Lake Borgne, and Bay Boudreau Tursiops truncatus (Common Bottlenose Dolphin) stock. Using the resulting mark-recapture data, we estimated the survival and population growth rates using a reverse capture-recapture method. The estimated monthly survival probability over this period of time was 0.969 (95% CI: 0.964-0.974). The final monthly population growth rate was then estimated to be 1.005 (95% CI: 0.998-1.013), which suggests a relatively stable population. © 2021 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: The distribution, habitat preferences and site fidelity of Risso’s dolphin in the Strait of Sicily are very little known. During sea surveys conducted in three summer seasons, we sighted this species offshore Linosa Island in groups of variable numbers of individuals (2-20, average 9.7 ± 7.0 SD). Sightings were concentrated in a small area whose medium depth (average, 591 m) and bathymetric features are in line with the known habitat preferences of the species. A total of 32 individuals belonging to four age classes were photo-identified; eight were re-sighted once over the years. We report for the first time the presence of Risso’s dolphin in the waters around Linosa Island. The results seem to indicate a site fidelity over the years.

ABSTRACT: This research focused on different aspects of play behavior including ethogram, ontogeny, and individual differences, in one male and one female captive bottlenose dolphin calves (Tursiops truncatus) from November 2003 to June 2004. We presented the first peer-reviewed description of a play ethogram in bottlenose dolphin calves whose behaviors were grouped into three hierarchical levels: two categories: solitary and social play; four subcategories: locomotor, object, bubble play, and in the presence of humans, and 35 entries. It was conducted in two phases: the descriptive phase–from 3 to 5 months old–with 29 entries and the quantitative phase–from 6 to 10 months old –with six entries. All social and solitary locomotor behaviors appeared when animals were 3 months old meanwhile more complex behaviors concerning playing with objects, bubbles, and in the presence of humans were observed for 6 months old. There were no statistically significant intra-individual and inter-individual differences in the play behavioral diversity, in the time invested in play and in the Shannon’s evenness index. However, we observed statistically significant inter-individual but not intra-individual differences for the Shannon’s diversity index. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The Mediterranean subpopulation of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) is classed as vulnerable with a decreasing population trend. Yet, research effort in the Mediterranean varies with relatively little being known of the Southern Adriatic Sea's bottlenose dolphins, which face increasing numbers of anthropogenic threats, mainly marine traffic, tourism, fishing and seismic activity. To investigate trends in bottlenose dolphin presence, group size and sub-adult presence in Montenegrin waters, 576 land and boat surveys were conducted from September 2016 to August 2020. Chisquared tests showed a significant decline in bottlenose dolphin presence over the four years. Changes in group size over the four-year period were also assessed using Chi-squared tests, and results showed that in Year 1 (September 2016 to August 2017) significantly more medium (3-4 individuals) and large (over 5 individuals) groups were observed than expected. Whereas, in the following three years more small groups were observed (1-2 individuals). Neither bottlenose dolphin presence nor group size was found to be associated with season. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of sub-adult presence with year, season and group size. Sub-adults were most likely to be present in the summer (June, July and August) and when group size was large. Montenegrin waters are of significant importance to the wider Adriatic. Therefore, urgent action is required to identify the cause of the declining trends and to protect Montenegro's bottlenose dolphin population from anthropogenic pressures. A dedicated management strategy must be quickly and effectively implemented, while continuous study is required to monitor and assess trends moving forward. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: A boat-based, photo-identification survey of common bottlenose dolphins in Montenegrin territorial waters was carried out to create a baseline database and inform future studies on their abundance and distribution. A total of 21 sightings were recorded during 27 outings in the period from May to September 2013, resulting in a total of 73 identified individuals. A weighted mean encounter rate of 0.006 groups km−1 was calculated using 5 × 5 km EEA grid cells with sufficient effort (&gt;7.07 km per cell). Using the Chao Mth model, the abundance of the resident community of common bottlenose dolphins inhabiting Montenegrin waters was estimated to be 90 individuals (SE = 14.92, LCI = 71, UCI = 152). Preliminary data indicates that there is a subset of individuals regularly using the enclosed Boka Kotorska Bay and further research is needed to investigate specific habitat use patterns. A precautionary approach should be implemented in conservation plans dealing with this data deficient bottlenose dolphin community. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Preventing declines in common species is key to sustaining the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Yet for many common marine mammals, including oceanic dolphins, statistical power to detect declines remains low due to patchy distribution and large variability in group sizes. In this study, population viability analyses (PVA) were used to model the dynamics of four oceanic dolphin populations off the United States West Coast: eastern North Pacific long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis capensis), short-beaked common dolphins (D. delphis delphis), Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), and “offshore” common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We calibrated the PVA with life-history tables, studies on proxy species, and stock assessment reports. We explored the sensitivity of populations to demographic variation and projected how they may respond to changes in three sublethal threats (prey limitation, ocean noise, and chemical pollution) and one lethal threat (fisheries bycatch). We found the most serious projected declines in long-beaked common dolphins, which showed the lowest birth rate. Most threat scenarios resulted in declines that would not be detected by existing monitoring programs in the United States, which are among the most data-rich surveys of their kind. The cumulative effects of the three sublethal stressors exceeded the effect of the one lethal stressor (fisheries bycatch). To implement pro-active management and monitoring programs, anticipating which cetaceans are more at risk and which anthropogenic threats could cause declines is paramount. Our study highlights the value of model testing with PVA when monitoring data are poor, thereby identifying priorities for future research, monitoring, and management. © Copyright © 2021 Ashe, Williams, Clark, Erbe, Gerber, Hall, Hammond, Lacy, Reeves and Vollmer.

ABSTRACT: Recent observed attacks by male Amazon river dolphins on conspecific calves, together with postmortem examinations, indicate that infanticide occurs in this species but that not all attacked calves are killed. If mortality occurs, it might therefore be an inadvertent consequence of the behaviour rather than the motive for it. Our observations suggest that males who commit infanticide are unlikely to gain direct fitness benefits. Evidence does not fit the sexual selection hypothesis. Aggression towards calves usually ‘drew a crowd’ and may represent socio-sexual display or simply be a form of social pathology, as found in other infanticidal mammals. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2021

ABSTRACT: The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea has been described as South Africa's most endangered marine mammal due to its low abundance, reliance on coastal habitats with increasing anthropogenic threats and high rates of mortality from bycatch in bather protection nets (BPNs). Although the species has been well studied in South Africa, only a single study has examined its molecular ecology to date, and its population structure remains poorly understood. However, understanding population structure is vital for the conservation and management of a species. To address these research gaps for S. plumbea in South African waters, we analysed the mitochondrial D-loop of 157 museum skin and tooth samples collected between 1963 and 2017 from across the species' geographic range in South Africa. Our data show that the humpback dolphin has extremely low mitochondrial diversity (haplotype diversity, HD = 0.47; nucleotide diversity, π = 0.2 %) with only 3 haplotypes identified, which is comparable to the Critically Endangered Māui dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori maui and the Critically Endangered Mekong population of Irrawaddy dolphin Orcaella brevirostris. Mitochondrial genetic diversity has not changed significantly in the last 50 yr, despite the high levels of bycatch in BPNs over this time period. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differentiation between dolphins from the KwaZulu-Natal Coast and the Cape South Coast (Western Cape and Eastern Cape). The extremely low mitochondrial diversity we found adds to the growing body of evidence that the humpback dolphin is becoming increasingly vulnerable and that urgent conservation efforts are required for the survival of the species. © 2021.

ABSTRACT: In many regions of the world, the use of cetaceans as bait or protein source has been reported. In most cases the individuals are from bycatch but also from intentionally killed animals. Cetaceans with coastal habits are more susceptible to negative interactions with small-scale fisheries, as in the case of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) in the Lake Maracaibo system. For decades, the use of Guiana dolphins by local communities has been reported in this region and is culturally supported by recipes for its preparation. Most of these data was outdated and some were anecdotal, so the objective of this work was to collect systematically data through surveys using the snowball method in seven artisanal fishing communities and to try to quantify the capture rate and to inquire about the potential impact of this practice on the population of Guiana dolphin. From 2017 to 2019, 95 semi-structured interviews were applied. An average bycatch of 180 individuals/year was obtained, the highest catch rate in the entire geographic distribution, an alarming situation considering that the surveys were not carried out in all the fishing ports, generating an underestimation. A total of 78% of interviewed recognized at least one bycatch event during their fishing effort. Surveys revealed a higher incidence of entanglement of offspring and juveniles (78%). 77% of the respondents deny the sale and commercialization of the species, while 5% mention some type of trade. The most frequent part exploited was the dorsal muscle, confirmed by fishermen (97%, n = 72) and the rest of the animal is discarded. During this investigation three episodes of directed capture were recorded, affecting a total of 23 individuals, two of them were pregnant females. The interviews also revealed that the majority of fishermen (93%) recognize the capture of this species as illegal. Considering the vulnerability of the Guiana dolphin in the country, the high incidence of capture and consumption and the lack of surveillance and sanctions by government entities, it is imperative to immediate actions to mitigate the negative impact on the population. © Copyright © 2021 Briceño, Sánchez, Trujillo, von Fersen and Ramírez.

ABSTRACT: Ganga River starting from Gangotri glacier at Gaumukh, travels the distance of about 2525 km between Gangotri to Bay of Bengal. About 30% of India’s population depends on Ganga River for most of its life sustaining resources. On the other hand on account of our increasing requirements, industrialization, this sacred river has been exposed to serious contamination from different sources resulting in breaking the ecosystems of the river thereby existence of a number of floristic and faunistic populations are facing threat to their existence. The stretch between Varanasi to Farakka of the river is too crucial for the Ganges River Dolphin and other endangered and endemic aquatic animals of Ganga River such as Otters, Turtles, Gharials, and fishes endangering a number of endemic fauna. The Ganga River dolphin “Platanista gangetica gangetica, " commonly known as Gangetic Dolphin is the world’s most threatened freshwater dwelling mammal (cetacean). The Gangetic river Dolphin is mainly solitary and nongregarious, once in a while found in little gatherings. It is prominent as well as the climax species of this aquatic ecosystem, when considered holistically. Prey accessibility and water quality and volume are restrictive factors for their abundance. The Gangetic Dolphin is also an indicator species for the river’s ecosystem, being at the apex of the food chain. But a rapid rise in human population and increasing aquatic pollution of the river are equally rapidly depleting its population. A short term expedition was conducted by three members of Indian Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haridwar, during June-July 2018 between Varanasi to Farakka stretch of National Waterways-1. The expedition was in reference to the forthcoming project of India’s government to begin commercial navigation in this part of the river extending to Haldia port. This paper presents a brief account of eco-biological status of the Gangetic Dolphin, along with the study area/stretch, its abundance, with hydro-biological status of river Ganga around eight stations being prepared as terminals or ports, for the study period of June-July. Numerous potential threats were confronted during the present investigation like injurious fishing gears, use of mosquito nets, illegal capturing of zebra fish, dumping of solid and municipal waste, industrial effluents, domestic sewage drains and reduction of river depth attributed to siltation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: There is increasing concern over anthropogenically driven changes in our oceans and seas, from a variety of stressors. Such stressors include the increased risk of storms and precipitation, offshore industries and increased coastal development which can affect the marine environment. For some coastal cetacean species, there is an increased exposure to low salinity waters which have been linked with a range of adverse health effects in bottlenose dolphins. Knowledge gaps persist regarding how different time–salinity exposures affect the health and survival of animals. In such data-poor instances, expert elicitation can be used to convert an expert’s qualitative knowledge into subjective probability distributions. The management implications of this stressor and the subjective nature of expert elicitation requires transparency; we have addressed this here, utilizing the Sheffield Elicitation Framework. The results are a series of time response scenarios to estimate time to death in bottlenose dolphins, for use when data are insufficient to estimate probabilistic summaries. This study improves our understanding of how low salinity exposure effects dolphins, guiding priorities for future research, while its outputs can be used to support coastal management on a global scale. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The present work aimed to understand the status of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin, Tursiops aduncus Ehrenberg, 1833 (Family Delphinidae: Order Cetacea) sighting in the northern protected Islands. An exclusive study was conducted to describe the sighting of T. aduncus in the northern Red Sea. Sighting of dolphins became the most attractive ecotourism in the Red Sea, especially in Hurghada within the marine boundary of the northern protectorate. Dolphin sighting was monitored in three selected sites, located within the northern protected area (Shaab El-Fanous, Shaab El-Erg, and El-Gouna reef) during the period from July 2015 till May 2017. At the selected sites, the mean value of dolphin sighting showed a seasonal different pattern, recording a sharp peak in spring and summer (June, July and August), and a decline in autumn (October and November). The estimated mean of dolphin sighting averaged 4.9±3.6, 5.1±4.9; 7.8±5.4 individual/ day at Shaab El-Fanous, Shaab El-Erg and El-Gouna reef, respectively. Whereas, the mean of snorkeler/day and boats /day averaged 56 and 5; 82 and 5; 83 and 3 /day at Shaab El-Fanous, Shaab El-Erg and El-Gouna reef, respectively. The daily pattern of dolphin sighting exhibits different ones during the resting time at the study sites. At Shaab El-Fanous, the rest period extended from 8:30 am to 13:00 pm, with a peak at 11:00 am compared to a dolphin rest period from 9:00 am to 14:00 pm, with a peak at 11:30 at Shaab El-Erg and from 9:00 am to 13:30 pm, with a peak at 11:30 am at El-Gouna reefs. The obtained results indicated that in the Red Sea from Halayeb City to Al-Zafarana City, fifteen cases of dolphin accidents were recorded (total 25 individuals) during the last seven years (2014-2021). In the Egyptian Red Sea shore, common threats encountered T. aduncus including fishing nets, shark attacks, and boat accidents. Consequently, great mortality data was determined among T. aduncus; about 88% (22 individuals). © 2021, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive data can provide important information for the conservation and management of threatened animals. The small resident Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) population in Xiamen Bay is threatened by frequent exposure to anthropogenic activities, and its reproductive ecology is still unknown. Based on photo-identification data collected from August 2010 to August 2015, the present study tracked 13 reproductive females and 19 of their calves and estimated the reproductive data. Births occurred all year round but were mainly concentrated in spring and summer; the annual crude birth rate was 0.053 ± 0.025, and the annual recruitment rate was 0.028 ± 0.024; the calf survival rate to 1 year old was 0.600 ± 0.392; and females had a long inter-birth interval (4.27 ± 1.06 y). All these factors may be due to intense extrinsic anthropogenic disturbances (such as busy vessel traffic and coastal construction). In addition to these substantial extrinsic pressures, the low birth rate, low calf survival rate, and long inter-birth interval of humpback dolphins would further intrinsically preclude the sustainable survival of this population. © 2021.

ABSTRACT: An understanding of population structure and connectivity at multiple spatial scales is required to assist wildlife conservation and management. This is particularly critical for widely distributed and highly mobile marine mammals subject to fisheries by-catch. Here, we present a population genomic assessment of a near-top predator, the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), which is incidentally caught in multiple fisheries across the Australasian region. The study was carried out using 14,799 ddRAD sequenced genome-wide markers genotyped for 478 individuals sampled at multiple spatial scales across Australasia. A complex hierarchical metapopulation structure was identified, with three highly distinct and genetically diverse regional populations at large spatial scales (>1,500 km). The populations inhabit the southern coast of Australia, the eastern coast of Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania, with the latter also showing a considerable level of admixture to Australia's east coast. Each of these regional populations contained two to four nested local populations (i.e., subpopulations) at finer spatial scales, with most of the gene flow occurring within distances of 50 to 400 km. Estimates of contemporary migration rates between adjacent subpopulations ranged from 6 to 25%. Overall, our findings identified complex common dolphin population structure and connectivity across state and international jurisdictions, including migration and gene flow across the Tasman Sea. The results indicate that inter-jurisdictional collaboration is required to implement conservation management strategies and mitigate fisheries interactions of common dolphins across multiple spatial scales in the Australasian region. © Copyright © 2021 Barceló, Sandoval-Castillo, Stockin, Bilgmann, Attard, Zanardo, Parra, Hupman, Reeves, Betty, Tezanos-Pinto, Beheregaray and Möller.

ABSTRACT: Flood risk management comprises two phases; the first deals with risk analysis and assessment while the second considers risk prevention and mitigation. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) based multi-thematic scenario is developed, risk extent and quantity were calculated at multiple levels. Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary was selected as study area. Assets at risk were estimated in numbers showing annual average damage per unit area and coverage maps show their distribution pattern. Risk zonation layers were also developed to estimate the risk extent in terms of high, medium, and low risk. Population data were acquired and analyzed to find out inhabitants at different risk categories. Similarly, erosion and accretion layers were extracted from temporal land cover/land use datasets to analyze environmental risk. Results of flood inundation were utilized for flood depth analysis. During the 2010 Flood, almost 4200 small and large villages/towns were inundated. Out of 4,200, approximately 1,750 villages/towns are on the right bank and the remaining 2,450 are on the left bank which highlights high economic and financial risk. However, all methods chosen here to estimate the different risk criteria (inundation modeling as well as damage evaluation) are approximate approaches but develop a strong foundation for decision-makers. © 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Microplastic pollution is a growing concern worldwide. Despite numerous studies showing the occurrence of microplastics in low-trophic level aquatic organisms, microplastic ingestion and contamination in cetaceans, especially those from Asian waters, has been rarely recorded. Here, we investigated stomach microplastic pollution in twelve Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins stranded along the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. We also compared microplastic abundances in dolphins stranded near populated urban areas (ZH, n = 6) with those stranded near rural areas (JM, n = 6). Microplastics were detected in all samples, with abundance ranging widely from 11 to 145 items individual−1 (mean ± SD, 53 ± 35.2). Major microplastics were polypropylene and polyethylene fibers, with the size mostly ranging from 1 to 5 mm and the dominant colors of white or transparent. Humpback dolphins from ZH (73 ± 36.8 items individual−1) exhibited a significantly higher average microplastic abundance than those from JM (33 ± 18.3 items individual−1, p < 0.05). In particular, the highest microplastic concentration was identified in the dolphin (SC-ZH01) stranded near the mouth of the Pearl River, whereas the dolphin (SC-JM04) collected at the rural site contained the lowest concentration of microplastics, suggesting the important influence of land-based human activities on the accumulation of microplastics in the PRE. The identification of varied microplastic polymers indicated their complex source scenarios. This study suggests that, as one of top predators in the potential microplastic food chains, this cetacean species could likely serve as an endpoint biomonitoring species of microplastic pollution in the PRE or other similar estuarine ecosystems. Our results highlight the need for more studies towards better understanding the potential impacts of microplastics on this endangered species. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is an endangered, small cetacean species which is widely distributed in rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters throughout the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific. Despite the extensive distribution of this species, little is known of individual movements or genetic exchange among regions in Thailand. Here, we evaluate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of O. brevirostris in the eastern, northern and western Gulf of Thailand, and Andaman Sea. Although phylogenetic relationships and network analysis based on 15 haplotypes obtained from 32 individuals reveal no obvious divergence, significant genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA (overall FST = 0.226, P < 0.001; ΦST = 0.252, P < 0.001) is apparent among regions. Of 18 tested microsatellite loci, 10 are polymorphic and successfully characterized in 28 individuals, revealing significant genetic differentiation (overall FST = 0.077, P < 0.05) among the four sampling sites. Structure analysis reveals two inferred genetic clusters. Additionally, Mantel analysis demonstrates individual-by-individual genetic distances and geographic distances follow an isolation-by-distance model. We speculate that the significant genetic structure of O. brevirostris in Thailand is associated with a combination of geographical distribution patterns, environmental and anthropogenic factors, and local adaptations. © Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to produce G-banded karyotypes of three dolphin species, Tursiops truncatus Montagu, 1821, Tursiops australis Charlton-Robb et al., 2011, and Grampus griseus Cuvier, 1812, and to determine if any diferences between the species can be observed. Monolayer skin cultures were established and processed for chromosome study by trypsin banding. Te results indicate that the three species here investigated have the same diploid number (2n = 44) and very similar gross chromosome morphology, however G-banding allows distinction between each species. Chromosome 1 in G. griseus is signifcantly diferent from the other 2 species, and chromosome 2 in T. australis is subtly diferent from the other 2 species. Tis result is of potential signifcance in taxonomic studies, and can provide an unequivocal answer in the assessment of suspected hybrids between these species. © Ross Brookwell et al.

ABSTRACT: The increasing recognition of the importance of biodiversity and genetic variation has led to more frequent calls for their preservation. Moreover, novel molecular and advanced genomic tools can be effectively employed to incorporate genetic variability and genomic information into conservation planning and sustainable programs, aimed at species conservation and slowing the erosion of biological diversity. The particular geomorphological and hydrographic features of Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central Mediterranean Sea), supports the occurrence of different cetacean species among that the striped dolphin is the more frequent and abundant species. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic variability of this species in the study area, deepening the possibility to identify a subpopulation in the basin. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in aerial drones offer new insights into the biology, ecology and behaviour of marine wildlife found on or near the ocean’s surface. While opening up new opportunities for enhanced wildlife monitoring, the impacts of drone sampling and how it might influence interpretations of animal behaviour are only just beginning to be understood. The capacity of drones to record bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops spp.) behaviour was investigated, along with how the presence of a small drone at varying altitudes influences dolphin behaviour. Over 3 years and eight locations, 361 drone flights were completed between altitudes of 5 and 60 m above the ocean. Analyses showed that dolphins were increasingly likely to change behaviour with decreasing drone altitude. A positive correlation was also found between time spent hovering above a group of dolphins and the probability of recording a behavioural response. Dolphin group size also influenced the frequency of an observed behavioural change, displaying a positive correlation between behaviour change and group size. Overall, although drones have the potential to impact coastal dolphins when flown at low altitudes, they represent a useful tool for collecting ecological information on coastal dolphins owing to their convenience, low cost and capacity to observe behaviours underwater. To maximize benefits and minimize impacts, this study suggests that drones should be flown 30 m above coastal bottlenose dolphins. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Brachygnathism is a congenital malformation involving an abnormal truncation of the maxillae (brachygnathia superior) or mandibles (brachyg nathia inferior), which can lead to a severe malocclusion (Barker etal., 1993). This condition iscommonly seen in species such as cattle (Kene & Uwagie-Ero, 2001; Citek et al., 2009; Hoy et al., 2011), dogs (Fox, 1963; Borissov et al., 2004), wild ungulates (Hoy et al., 2011), and humans (Mackay et al., 1992; Ariji et al., 2000). The few descriptions of brachygna thism in cetaceans have resulted from examinations of stranded dolphins. Elorriaga-Verplancken et al. (2015) reported a live stranded common bottlenose dolphin (Zursiops truncatus; hereafter bottlenose dolphin), which presented with both brachygnathia superior and a severe oral infestation of rabbit-ear barnacles (Conchoderma auritum). In this case, the distal halves of the maxillae were abnormally truncated, measuring approximately one half the length of the mandible. Traumatic injury could not be ruled out as the cause of this particular deformity, perhaps in part due to the damage incurred from the described barnacle infestation. However, the authors posited that the barnacle growth was facilitated by the presence of exposed teeth caused by the rostral deformity. In this case, the animal presented with a healthy overall body condition, suggesting that the deformity did not significantly affect the animal's ability to hunt. Similar observations of brachygnathia infe-Tior were observed by Van Bressem et al. (2006) in a long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus deiphis [originally reported as D. capensis}) taken as fisherles bycatch in Peru. In this case, the distal halves of the maxillae and mandible were curved upwards, and the mandible was observed to be shorter than both the maxillaries and premaxillaries; however, a similar barnacle infestation was not observed. This animal also presented with a healthy body condition, indicating that the animal was able to forage effectively. © 2021, Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: In the southeastern United States (SEUS), common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) occur in a complex mosaic of bay, sound, and estuary (BSE) and coastal stocks in which there can be a high degree of stock overlap and boundaries that can be particularly difficult to differentiate on both spatial and temporal scales (Hayes et al., 2020). Along the Atlantic coast of the U.S., there are two migratory coastal stocks that have extended seasonal movements from New York to North Carolina (Northern Migratory Coastal Stock) and North Carolina to Florida (Southern Migratory Coastal Stock), and three additional coastal stocks (South Carolina-Georgia, Northern Florida, and Central Florida) that have more limited ranges. There are also 11 BSE stocks extending from North Carolina to Florida in which animals display long-term (multi-season and year) site fidelity to a localized geographic region. © 2021, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The estuaries within the Pearl River Delta are sites for large-scale urban development and offshore construction. These projects have conservation stakeholders calling for more protection for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins whose habitat overlaps with current and proposed construction sites. Efforts to improve impact assessments are hindered by the lack of baseline data and comprehensive understanding of how often the dolphins are present in areas near or within locations targeted for further development. The Modaomen Estuary within the Pearl River Delta is a good example of this, with little consideration for the dolphins as no data on their diurnal and seasonal occurrences within the estuary exist. A passive acoustic monitoring system was deployed over a calendar year from October 2016 to September 2017 to monitor the presence of humpback dolphins in the Modaomen Estuary. Results indicated that the estuary is an important area for humpback dolphins, with regular diel rhythms and seasonality in detection rates. For example, higher detections were seen during the wet season than during the dry season. However, there was no significant difference in detection rates between the flood and ebb tides, or between high and low tidal phases. Since the Modaomen Estuary is targeted for further development in the near future, these data provide the rationale for resource management and consent processes to consider potential impacts on the dolphins, as well as to aid marine spatial planning and conservation measures. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Although several studies have shown that dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) may be beneficial for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), most of these studies have methodological weaknesses. This study tested the effectiveness of DAT in improving the social and communicative skills of children with ASD. We used a pretest–posttest design with a control group. The 48 participants were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: age between 4 and 5 years, diagnosis of ASD, and clear impairment in communication. Participants were randomly assigned to the groups: DAT and Therapy Without Dolphins (TWD). The research lasted 10 weeks. The intervention phase lasted 6 weeks and consisted of three weekly 45-min sessions, with a total of 18 sessions per participant. Therapy sessions for both groups, DAT and TWD, were conducted by a dolphin trainer and a health professional in the same facilities and under the same conditions, except for the use of the interaction with the dolphin as support for the activities. Three instruments were used to assess communicative and social skills: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic, the Reynell Developmental Language scales, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior scales. Significant improvements were observed between the pretests and posttests in both groups, DAT and TWD, on the total scores of all the scales, except for the Social Interaction Domain of the ADOS-G. These improvements were significantly greater for the DAT group on only two items of the Language and Communication Domain, ADOS-G: “frequency of vocalizations toward others” and “gestures” (η 2 = 0.11, p < 0.05) in both cases. In conclusion, we found some evidence that DAT is a useful therapeutic intervention to foster the social and communication skills of children with ASD and that dolphins specifically can enhance the improvement of some communication-related aspects. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Lung function (breath duration, respiratory flow [], and tidal volume [VT]), and end-expiratory O2 were measured in 19 adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) while at rest in water or beached for up to 10 min. The results show that inspiratory VT, expiratory VT, or inspiratory did not differ on land or in water. The average expiratory for all dolphins on land decreased by 16%, and the expiratory and total breath durations increased by 5% and 4%, respectively, compared with in water. There were temporal changes observed during beaching, where expired and inspired VT and inspired decreased by 13%, 16%, and 9%, respectively, after 10 min on land. These data suggest that dolphins compensate for the effect of gravity by adjusting respiration to maintain alveolar ventilation and gas exchange, but during extended durations, the increased work of breathing may impede ventilation and gas exchange. Continuous monitoring of lung function and gas exchange may help prevent long-Term damage during out-of-water medical procedures, optimize animal transport conditions, and improve survival during stranding events.  © Copyright 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Ecological niche models (ENMs) predict where species can occur in accordance with environmental factors. Suitability maps are generated through models to identify habitats more or less adapted to the species. Published works on the distribution and habitat use of Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, are limited to fine spatial scales. Here, we aimed to predict the potential geographical distribution of Guiana dolphins through ENMs and generate a map of suitable habitats for the species. Data were collected between 1997 and 2015 in Brazil, French Guiana, and Colombia. The environmental data were obtained from MARSPEC database with a cell resolution of 10 × 10 km. For modeling, 99 of the 859 initial occurrence points of the species were considered after rarefaction. Seven environmental variables were selected through factorial analysis: bathymetry, distance to shore, bathymetric slope, sea surface salinity (minimum monthly and annual range), and sea surface temperature (mean annual and annual range). Results from five distinct algorithms were assembled to generate the distribution model. Our findings show potential areas in shallow platforms of the continental margin of South and Central America, including regions where the species has never been reported, such as the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the oceanic islands in the Caribbean Sea. The absence of Guiana dolphins in these regions may be due to geographical (linking of North and South America), physical (water temperature), and biological (competition, limited ability to dispersal) limiting factors. The models suggest that the presence of other species of coastal dolphin may be an important limiting factor for the Guiana dolphin at both extremes of its distribution. The Guiana dolphin is habitat specialist with a clinal potential geographic distribution concentrated in tropical and subtropical shallow and coastal waters of the continental shelf of the western Atlantic Ocean. This more restricted distribution than reported by IUCN and other studies suggests a cautionary approach to its conservation status due to limited dispersal abilities and high overlap with human activities.  © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The photo-identification of individuals within an animal population is an important objective for the description of the environment itself, for studies relating to the distribution of species and their habitat-use as well as their conservation. The manual analysis of the photos collected by experts is generally very expensive in terms of time and requires specific knowledge. In the field of cetology, photo-identification based on the dorsal fin of individuals is widespread. The software here presented aims to effectively isolate the outline of the dorsal fin, so that it can be used in applications that exploit nicks, notches and other irregularities for the identification and classification process. It implements a series of innovative and specific operations that make the tool applicable to very large datasets with good performances and it has been successfully used for the extraction of the fin outline on dolphin images acquired in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea - Central Mediterranean Sea). © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Many marine mammal species exhibit complex patterns of population structure. Specifically, common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) populations in the southeastern United States display varying degrees of spatial overlap and residency, including some that have year-round site fidelity to localized bays, sounds, and estuaries. Evidence of resident estuarine animals along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines is supported through photo-identification and genetic studies, although, currently, few studies have integrated both methods. The purpose of this project was to couple long-term photo-identification data with spatial and genetic analyses to examine population structure of common bottlenose dolphins in northern Georgia. Genomic DNA was extracted from skin samples (n = 69) collected in the Northern Georgia/Southern South Carolina Estuarine System Stock, and a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced. To determine potential fine-scale geographic delineations within this stock, the study area was split into three regions: (1) north, (2) buffer, and (3) south. No significant genetic differentiation was found when regions were compared by only sample collection location. The sighting locations of sampled dolphins that had been seen > 10 times between 2009 and 2017 (n = 45) were mapped in ArcMap, Version 10.2. In an analysis of dolphins with > 10 sightings only, a significant difference in FST was found between the north vs buffer area (p = 0.0147). When dolphins with > 10 sightings (n = 45) were assigned to the region where > 50% of their sightings were located, a significant difference in FST was found between the north vs buffer and north vs south regions (p = 0.0018 and p = 0.0164, respectively). The addition of spatial data revealed genetic division among the three regions. Thus, the combination of photo-identification and genetic analyses used in this study may be useful in determining population structure in the future. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: A male bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) approximately 16 years of age was found to have a swollen lesion on the skin of the perineum. this lesion first appeared as a regular cutaneous wound that had problems healing due to the swelling extension, and depth. It was treated using systemic antibiotics, NSAIDs, and wound care. Three years later, the animal presented new superficial skin lesions in the same area. Although they resolved with basic wound care, a 5-cm circular and ery thematous swelling developed. Leukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased γ-globulins resulted from the blood exams. However, no abnormalities were found in the serum biochemistry. Ultrasound examination of the swelling together with a cytological sample and its culture confirmed the diagnosis of a septic abscess. Due to the nature and location of the abscess, a medical approach was preferred. Systemic antibiotherapy, analgesics, periodic drainage and irrigation of the lesion with an antibiotic solution, and inoculation of plasma rich growing factors resulted in the successful control of the infection. Morganella morganii was isolated pure culture. Initial antibiogram showed sensitivity of the bacterium to third-generation cephalosporins However, successive control demonstrated resistance not only to third-generation cephalosporins but also to fourth-generation cephalosporins © 2021, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Abstract. Striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) mass-stranded on 26 April 2013 at Minamisatsuma, Kagoshima Prefecture, in southern Japan (East China Sea). The diet of the mass-stranded striped dolphins was investigated to reveal their foraging pattern through analyses of the stomach contents and stable isotopes in muscle. Of 26 stomachs sampled, 25 contained hard parts of prey animals; no fleshy remains were found in any of the stomachs. The identified prey species represented four cephalopod families: Loliginidae, Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae, and Ommastrephidae. Among these, ommastrephids had the highest abundance (42.4%) and frequency of occurrence (69.2%). A chi-square test revealed that the prey species consumed did not significantly differ between male and female dolphins, although deeper-water squids (Onychoteuthidae and Histioteuthidae) appeared only in the stomachs of females. The values of δ13C ranged from -20.4 to -17.0‰ (mean ± SD: -18.2 ± 0.9‰), and values of δ15N ranged from 10.2 to 12.5‰ (10.8 ± 0.5‰), with a significant difference in δ15N between sexes (P < 0.05).  ©

ABSTRACT: This paper deals with the hydrodynamic effect of the ship on a flexible dolphin during a mooring manoeuvre. The hydrodynamic effect refers to the change in momentum of the surrounding fluid, which is defined by the concept of added mass. The main reason for the present study is to answer the question, “What is the effect of the added mass compared to the mass of the ship during the mooring procedure for a particular type of ship?” Measured angular frequencies of dolphin oscillations showed that the mathematical model can be approximated by the zero frequency limit. This simplifies the problem to some extent. The mooring is a pure rocking motion, and the 3D study is approximated by the strip theory approach. Moreover, the calculations were performed with conformal mapping using conformal Lewis mapping for the hull geometry. The fluid flow is assumed to be non-viscous, non-rotating and incompressible. The results showed that the additional mass effect must be taken into account when calculating the flexible dolphin loads. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Organisms utilize suitable habitat patches wherein they optimize fitness. For marine megafauna such as cetaceans, foraging is generally the explanation for their utilization distribution. However, an explicit link between cetaceans' distribution and spatio-temporal pattern of food resource is usually lacking. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis; VU listed in the IUCN Red List) inhabits the coastal waters from south-east China to eastern India. Seasonal distribution of the humpback dolphin was explored in the northern Beibu Gulf, China. Sightings of the humpback dolphin were systematically collected at monthly intervals from 2012 winter till 2018 spring and used to derive distribution patterns from kernel density estimates. Satellite remotely sensed net primary productivity (NPP) and bathymetry were used to present oceanographic characteristics in the study region. Seasonal variations were observed in oceanographic characteristics and spatial distribution of the humpback dolphin. Although the core distribution area of the humpback dolphin showed seasonal expansion and contraction, it had consistently higher NPP and shallower depth than the survey range throughout the seasons. Our findings indicate a clear profile of these two oceanographic characteristics (i.e. NPP and bathymetry) in the humpback dolphin's core distribution area. Food resource utilization could play an important role in the humpback dolphin's distribution within the study site. The seasonal dynamics imply that not only food abundance, but also efficiency in accessing/capturing the prey may affect distribution of the humpback dolphin. In the study site, human activities that can change regional topography and productivity of the coastal water through land reclamation, dredging, sand mining and bottom trawling, should be mitigated, regulated or avoided. Proactive conservation should incorporate catchment management of the main rivers to address potential sediment and nutrient load into the estuary to protect local habitat configuration in terms of NPP and bathymetry. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A small population of approximately 68 bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, resident in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is subject to physiologically challenging conditions, and is exposed to anthropogenic pressure from tourism. A voluntary Code of Management incorporating dolphin protection zones (DPZs), in which tour boat access is limited, was established in 2008. Kernel density estimation (KDE) was used to quantify dolphin habitat use over a 13-year period in order to describe seasonal variation in habitat use and consistency of habitat use over a decadal period, and to provide quantitative estimates of the extent of overlap between DPZs and core areas (50% volume contour) of habitat use. Habitat use varied seasonally, with the inner fjord area used more frequently in warmer months, and with a shift in use to the outer fjord in colder months. Patterns in habitat use were highly consistent over the 13-year duration of the study. The spatial overlap between the area of core dolphin habitat and DPZs was low (<18%) overall, and some DPZs were rarely used during colder periods. Consistency in habitat use through time vindicates spatial management, but low overlap between core habitat and current DPZs suggests that an expansion of the DPZ areas would confer greater protection. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) home range is located across Central and South American countries, in coastal habitats in the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean. Its distribution is scattered, with multiple population centers which are under threats that vary based on local realities. We compiled and assessed biological data from multiple sources (published and unpublished data) to improve our understanding regarding the Maracaibo Lake Management Unit, which is an isolated and unique population core of this species. We identified at least two distinguishable population centers throughout the Maracaibo Lake System, one in the northern portion—in the Gulf of Venezuela, and another in the southern portion of the Maracaibo Lake itself. Both centers have differences in some biological aspects (e.g., group size and habitat use), but similarities in the human-induced pressures (e.g., intentional take, habitat degradation, and traditional use). We detailed the uses of Guiana dolphin (consumptive and non-consumptive) by community members, including the use as talismans for indigenous fishers and consumption of its meat as a religious belief (Easter period), and dolphin watching tours carried out by local companies. In one artisanal port, at least 15 animals are intentionally taken annually to be used for local consumption, shark-bait, or trade; however, we acknowledge that this annual take is likely an underestimate. Further research is needed to clarify how and at what magnitude mentioned and other key-threats are impacting over Guiana dolphin MU in the Maracaibo Lake System. © Copyright © 2021 Barrios-Garrido, De Turris-Morales and Espinoza-Rodriguez.

ABSTRACT: Species conservation relies on understanding population demographics, yet this information is lacking for many species and populations. Four stocks of common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the waters surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands (USA) are exposed to anthropogenic disturbances including fisheries interactions, tourism, naval activities, ocean noise, and contaminants. Although these stocks are managed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, a demographic assessment has not been undertaken since 2006, and there is currently no information on population trends. We combined regular survey effort with citizen science contributions to estimate apparent survival and annual abundance within each stock using photographs collected between 2000 and 2018. Over this time period, we collected 2818 highquality identifications of 765 distinctive individuals across all 4 stocks. Analyses of inter-annual movements indicated that individuals exhibit restricted habitat use within stocks, which contributed to non-random sampling. Annual abundance estimates ranged from the 10s to the low 100s. Apparent survival ranged from 0.84 to 0.9, with lower-than-expected estimates in all stocks. Annual abundance estimates declined in 3 of the 4 stocks; however, this decline was not significant for the Kaua‘i/Ni‘ihau and O‘ahu stocks, and may be an artifact of sampling design in all stocks. Given the small population size for these stocks, it is important to closely monitor trends in abundance as a first step in mitigating negative effects of anthropogenic activities. Future efforts should focus on consistent geographic coverage in all stocks to decrease model uncertainty and improve trend assessment. © The authors 2021.

ABSTRACT: The relationships between cetaceans and remoras are still poorly known, especially those involving the species commonly referred to as the whalesucker (Remora australis), which attaches to cetaceans only. We report here on the association between resident common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncates) and whalesuckers at the remote Sño Pedro and Sño Paulo Archipelago (SPSPA) in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The study was conducted during four field expeditions between 2011 and 2013. A total of 13,720 photographs of the common bottlenose dolphins were taken from a small inflatable boat. From the analysed pictures, 141 were of dolphins with attached remoras, 70 of which were from 12 photo-identified dolphins (i.e., about 509c of the estimated population). The number of whalesuckers per dolphin, the size classes of these remoras, and their favoured attachment sites on the dolphins' bodies largely resemble the association of the same fish species with spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) at Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (FNA) in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It is noteworthy that we found more similarities than differences in the relationships between the dolphins and the whalesuckers at both these oceanic islands, despite the dolphins belonging to different species, having marked differences in body size, and the great disparity in their numbers: about 25 individuals at SPSPA vs hundreds (sometimes up to 2,000) at FNA. The present study strengthens the view that this remora takes advantage of the association with small swift cetaceans that congregate regularly in offshore areas and confirms the common bottlenose dolphin as a cetacean host for the whalesucker. © 2021, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Implementing conservation measures for data-limited species is a fundamental challenge for wildlife managers and policy-makers, and proves difficult for cryptic marine animals occurring in naturally low numbers across remote seascapes. There is currently scant information on the abundance and habitat preferences of Australian snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni) throughout much of their geographical range, and especially within the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. Such knowledge gaps curtail rigorous threat assessments on both local and regional scales. To address this and assist future conservation listings, we built the first comprehensive catalog of snubfin dolphin sightings for the Kimberley. We used these data to estimate the species’ extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) along the region’s 7,000 km coastline, following a simple Bootstrap bivariate kernel approach to combine datasets of varying quality and quantify uncertainty. Our catalog consists of 1,597 visual detections of snubfin dolphins made over a period of 17 years (2004–2020) and collated from multiple sources, including online biodiversity repositories, peer-reviewed scientific articles, citizen science programs, as well as dedicated marine wildlife surveys with local Indigenous communities and Ranger groups. Snubfin dolphins were consistently encountered in shallow waters (<21 m depth) close to (<15 km) freshwater inputs, with high detection rates in known hotspots (e.g., Roebuck Bay, Cygnet Bay) as well as in coastal habitats suspected to be suitable (e.g., Prince Regent River and surrounds, King Sound, Doubtful Bay, Napier Broome Bay and the upper Cambridge Gulf). Bootstrap estimates of EOO and AOO were 38,300 (95% CI: 25,451–42,437) km2 and 700 (656–736) km2 respectively, suggesting that snubfin dolphins in the Kimberley are likely Vulnerable under IUCN criteria B2 at a regional scale, in keeping with their global classification. Our study offers insights into the distribution of a vulnerable coastal cetacean species and demonstrates the value of integrating multiple data sources for informing conservation assessments in the face of uncertainty. © Copyright © 2020 Bouchet, Thiele, Marley, Waples, Weisenberger, Balanggarra Rangers, Bardi Jawi Rangers, Dambimangari Rangers, Nyamba Buru Yawuru Rangers, Nyul Nyul Rangers, Uunguu Rangers and Raudino.

ABSTRACT: Defining the trophic relationships of marine predators and their dietary preferences is essential in understanding their role and importance in ecosystems. Here we used stable isotope analysis of skin samples (δ15N values reflecting trophic level and δ13C values reflecting foraging habitat) to investigate resource partitioning and spatial differences of the feeding ecology of dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus and Heaviside's dolphins Cephalorhynchus heavisidii from 2 coastal study sites separated by 400 km along the coast of central (Walvis Bay) and southern (Lüderitz) Namibia in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. Overall, isotopic niches of both predators were significantly different, indicating partitioning of resources and foraging habitats. Despite their smaller body size, Heaviside's dolphins fed at a significantly higher trophic level than dusky dolphins. Stable isotope mixing models revealed that both species fed on high trophic level prey (i.e. large Merluccius spp., large Sufflogobius bibarbatus, and Trachurus t. capensis) at Walvis Bay. The diet of both dolphin species included smaller pelagic fish and squid at Lüderitz. Spatial differences highlight that Heaviside's and dusky dolphins may exhibit dietary plasticity driven by prey availability, and that they likely form distinct population segments. Important prey for both dolphin species, specifically Merluccius spp. and T. t. capensis, are the main target of trawl fisheries in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem, highlighting potential resource overlap between dolphins and fisheries. © Inter-Research 2021.

ABSTRACT: While the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the most studied and widespread cetacean in captivity, studies assessing its welfare have been developed only recently. Several studies focus on a potential indicator of stress: fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) concentration, which is expected to increase when the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated. However, a lack of studies that consider the biological variation of FGM concentrations related to sex and seasons, and the link to dolphins' reproductive status still impairs our ability to use it for monitoring purposes in the context of welfare assessment. Therefore, it is essential to explore and assess the potential influence of these factors on the variation of FGM concentrations in dolphins. In parallel, non-invasive sampling and methods of measurement should be developed. Thus, the authors performed a methodological validation of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for FGM in bottlenose dolphins and studied the influence of reproductive status, sex, and seasons on FGM concentrations. The findings showed significantly higher FGM concentrations in pregnant females than in other dolphins, and significantly higher FGM concentrations in males than in nonpregnant females. Moreover, only males showed higher concentrations during spring than during autumn and winter. In parallel, megestrol acetate used for male contraception and pregnancy in females appeared to inhibit and stimulate the HPA axis, respectively. This study creates new opportunities to use EIA as a tool for monitoring FGM concentrations in dolphins and provides new data on its biological variations. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: A small population of fewer than 80 Sousa chinensis taiwanensis inhabits the western coast of Taiwan. To explore the relationship between environmental factors (water depth, temperature, salinity, turbidity, and pH) and distribution patterns of dolphins, this study was conducted in Yunlin, which has been one of the population’s core areas despite being subject to heavy industrial development. 242 day-surveys were conducted along four parallel transect lines between 2008 to 2018, during which sightings of 274 dolphin groups of this species were recorded. The standardized dolphin sighting rate (groups/100km) was used as an index for comparison. Contrasting to the roughly steady distribution in east-west gradient, the north-south gradient exhibited substantial and varied temporospatial changes among three sections (north, middle, and south) off the coast of Yunlin and among three periods. Dolphin sighting rate during spring-summer was significantly higher than that during Autumn-winter. Taking data from inshore surveys for long term comparison, we found that sighting rates at the middle section remained high and relatively stable (around 2-4.6), whereas the rates in the other two sections exhibited opposite trend with high fluctuations, e.g. drastically fluctuated between 0-3.4 in the northern section, while from 3.36 declined to 0.35 in the southern section. We further discovered that rapid changes in three environmental factors, including turbidity, pH, water depth and construction disturbance, could play key roles on dolphin distribution patterns, and can serve as good indicators for habitat suitability for this vulnerable subspecies. © 2021, College of Life Science.

ABSTRACT: On a coastline in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, a wild subadult female striped dolphin was found dead. Necropsy revealed poor nutritional status and bilateral pneumonia, which was histologically diagnosed as severe suppurative necrotizing bronchopneumonia. Special staining detected numerous intralesional filamentous, branching bacteria, which was identified as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica by sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA and gyrB genes. Other main histological findings included lymphoid depletion in the spleen and superficial cervical and pulmonary lymph nodes. Suppurative nocardiosis without a granulomatous reaction is uncommon, and it is assumed its pathogenesis was related to the host’s immune status. This paper discusses the variable inflammatory response to nocardiosis and describes the first case of N. cyriacigeorgica infection in a wild striped dolphin in Japan. © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Much data is still lacking to conduct a rigorous assessment of the status of the Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, a coastal-estuarine dolphin of eastern Central America and north-eastern South America, considered vulnerable to extinction in Brazil, relevant information is still lacking to evaluate its global population trends. This article presents the first description of the occurrence of the Guiana dolphin in Camamu Bay in Brazil. From November 2016 to October 2017, we conducted 68 on-board monitoring in two zigzags transects, totalling 272 h of sampling effort. Seven groups composed of up to 5 individuals were sighted between November 2016 and June 2017, and five of these groups were encountered in the main channel of the bay. Sightings were independent of the monitoring period and of the phase of the semidiurnal tide but occurred within three days from a spring tide. Guiana dolphins are less frequent in Camamu Bay than in other geographically neighbouring estuaries, even the smaller ones. We hypothesize that the shallowness of the bay and boat traffic may explain this result. © NWJZ, Oradea, Romania, 2021

ABSTRACT: The Ambrosia Fusarium Clade (AFC) is a monophyletic lineage within clade 3 of the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) that currently comprises 19 genealogically exclusive species. These fungi are known or predicted to be farmed by adult female Euwallacea ambrosia beetles as a nutritional mutualism (Coleoptera: Scolytinae; Xyleborini). To date, only eight of the 19 AFC species have been described formally with Latin binomials. We describe three AFC species, previously known as AF-8, AF-10, and AF-11, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of multilocus DNA sequence data and comparative morphological/phenotypic studies. Fusarium duplospermum (AF-8) farmed by E. perbrevis on avocado in Florida, USA, is distinguished by forming two morphologically different types of multiseptate conidia and brownish orange colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Fusarium drepaniforme (AF-10), isolated from an unknown woody host in Singapore and deposited as Herb IMI 351954 in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK, under the name F. bugnicourtii, is diagnosed by frequent production of multiseptate sickle-shaped conidia. Fusarium papillatum (AF-11), isolated from mycangia of E. perbrevis infesting tea in Kandy, Sri Lanka, forms multiseptate clavate conidia that possess a papillate apical cell protruding toward the ventral side. Lastly, we prepared an augmented description of F. kuroshium (AF-12), previously isolated from the heads or galleries of E. kuroshio in a California sycamore tree, El Cajon, California, USA, and recently validated nomenclaturally as Fusarium. Conidia formed by F. kuroshium vary widely in size and shape, suggesting a close morphological relationship with F. floridanum, compared with all other AFC species. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses of a multilocus data set resolve these three novel AFC species, and F. kuroshium, as phylogenetically distinct based on genealogical concordance. Given the promiscuous nature of several Euwallacea species, and the overlapping geographic range of several AFC species and Euwallacea ambrosia beetles, the potential for symbiont switching among sympatric species is discussed. © 2021 The Mycological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: The striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, is one of the most abundant cetacean species off the Western Iberian coast, however, studies on the species regarding biology, ecology, threats or conservation efforts are lacking. This study investigates stranding patterns (years 1981–2014) and diet (2002–2014) of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) off the Portuguese mainland coast. Stranded animals were sampled along the whole coast (n = 252). Most stranded striped dolphins were recorded in the first half of the year and strandings increased over time. Analysis of stomach contents (n = 36) showed that striped dolphins in the area are mostly piscivorous (80% by number and weight of the diet), taking pelagic, meso-pelagic and demersal species. In terms of reconstructed biomass prey, sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) were the most important. Prey items revealed that both sexes forage at a range of depths (pelagic and demersal systems) in both neritic and oceanic habitats, although females feed more often in coastal waters. Moreover, diet results also indicate that striped dolphins may co-occur with other neritic cetacean species, such as the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, thus sharing some preferred prey species. The study revealed that striped dolphins on the Iberian coast interact with coastal fisheries sharing the same target species. Management measures for fisheries will need to be consistent with an ecosystem-based approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Our goal was to analyze the main anatomical structures of the dolphin external nose and nasal cavity from fetal developmental stages to adult. Endoscopy was used to study the common development of the external nose and the melon, and nasal mucosa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and anatomical sections were correlated with anatomical sections. Computed tomography (CT) was used to generate 3D reconstructions of the nasal bones and nasal cavities to study its development. Dissections, histological and pathological studies were carried out on the nasal mucosa to understand its function. These results were compared with the horse. Endoscopy showed an external nose with two lips and the upper lip is divided by a groove due to the nasal septum and an obstruction of right nasal cavity was diagnosed in a newborn. Two diverticula (air sacs) were found in the nasal vestibule and an incisive recess (premaxillary sac) in the nasal cavity. These findings were corroborated by 3D reconstructions of the nasal cavities, MRI, anatomical sections and dissections. The presphenoid and ethmoid bones were fused at early stages of fetal development. The ethmoid is the last bone to ossify in the nasal cavity. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) make extensive use of narrowband whistles with individually distinctive frequency modulations to broadcast their identity: the signature whistles. The acoustic structure of the signature whistles tends to be stable over decades. Therefore, these vocalisations have the potential to be used for monitoring individuals over time. Our study investigated the acoustic structure of the signature whistles of the demographic unit of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Eastern Ligurian Sea (Italy), within the Pelagos Sanctuary. Through visual categorisation of spectrograms, we identified 941 whistle contours, 469 of them were classified as signature whistles using the SIGnature IDentification (SIG-ID) method. We further grouped these into 19 different categories based on their stereotyped frequency modulation patterns. To support our categorisation, we used a combination of a visual classification task conducted by six naïve judges and an automated analysis, the principal component analysis. Overall, this study characterises the signature whistles of the demographic unit of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Ligurian Sea for the first time. Furthermore, when comparing the acoustic features of these whistles with those of other different demographic units available from the literature, we observed differences in the values of the minimum and maximum frequencies. Considering the critical vessel traffic of our study area, we interpreted these variations in light of the high levels of anthropogenic noise. We recommend further investigations to understand the mechanisms underpinning the acoustic variation of bottlenose dolphins’ signature whistles and to elaborate effective management and protection policies for this species. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The world’s most endangered small cetaceans are found in countries many miles from Sarasota Bay and its common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Information on the ecology and threats to many of these endangered cetaceans is often far more limited than that on bottlenose dolphins, with the IUCN Red Data List describing many species as “data deficient.” In many developing nations where these rare species occur, resources for research and monitoring are scant, and logistical challenges further limit research into marine mammal health and population status and their threats. The Sarasota Dolphin Research Program (SDRP) has tackled this problem by using the bottlenose dolphin as a model for cetacean species in other parts of the world and using its resources to assist scientists working with more endangered species of cetacean. The celebration of 50 years of study by the SDRP exemplifies how using long-term data on known individuals can advance the fields of cetacean behavior, ecology, life history, physiology, toxicology, and medicine, all providing information for informing certain conservation actions. The Sarasota team has used their work to inform conservation policy both home and abroad. © Copyright © 2021 Gulland.

ABSTRACT: Although previous studies have described progesterone profiles during pregnancy in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), most of these focused on normal pregnancy (NORM) or compared NORM to only one or two abnormal pregnancy types, such as abortion (AB) or perinatal loss (PNL). Hormonal pregnancy biomarker analysis from reproductive events with different outcomes may reveal differences in concentrations so that we are able to identify high risk pregnancies. The aim of this study was to describe longitudinal profiles of circulating progesterone and progestagens during reproductive events in the female bottlenose dolphin, including NORM, failure to thrive, PNL, AB, early loss (EL), and false pregnancy (FP). Progesterone differed from NORM during EL at EARLY (month post conception [MPC] 1–4), AB at MID (MPC 5–8), and FP at LATE (MPC 9–12) stages. Progestagens differed from NORM during AB and FP at MID and LATE stages and during MPC 12 in PNL and MPC 4 in EL. Progestagens may be better at predicting poor reproductive outcome in the bottlenose dolphin and a suite of hormone tests, including progesterone and progestagens, should be incorporated into existing clinical diagnostic and management practices in this species. Furthermore, analysis of multiple hormonal pregnancy biomarkers from a single sample may enable pregnancy diagnosis for wild animals. © Copyright © 2021 Robeck, Steinman, Parry, Gomez and Jensen.

ABSTRACT: Our understanding of the vocalizations of captive Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) is limited compared to our knowledge of these sounds in wild animals. Echolocation signals of wild Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins were recorded in the central-western Gulf of Thailand, and an ocean park in Trat Province, Thailand, using a cross array with five hydrophones. Both wild and captive animals produced broadband transient Click parameters of dif-clicks of short duration (21 ± 4 μs in the wild and 36 ± 2 μs in captivity). The inter-click intervals (37 ± 13.5 ms) for wild animals were longer than for captive animals (25 ± 1.2 ms). Statistical analysis showed that mean peak-to-peak (p-p) source levels of on-axis echolocation clicks varied significantly between wild (185 ± 5.8 dB re 1 μPa) and captive (169 ± 2.8 dB re 1 μPa; p < 0.001) environments. The frequency domain parameters of echolocation clicks of wild humpback dolphins were similar to those of captive hump-back dolphins, characterized by a mean centroid frequency of 106 ± 7.1 kHz and 105 ± 3.7 kHz,respectively. These results provide the first comparison of sound properties from both wild and captive humpback dolphins and could be valuable for the development of passive acoustic monitoring species classification tools to inform management and conservation efforts © 2021, Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: In a test-control study conducted in the Aeolian Archipelago (Southern Italy), acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) were applied to four gear types typical of local artisanal fisheries to assess their effectiveness in mitigating dolphin-fishery interactions. In this area ecosystem degradation and overfishing have been increasing bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) conflict with fishers. Banana Pingers were applied to Spicara maena gillnets, trammel nets, “lampara” nets and hand-operated squid jig lines (“totanara”) in trials conducted from April to September 2017. Dolphin depredation events were greatly reduced in the gillnet (100%) and the “lampara” net (86%), resulting in a strong increase in catch weight (kg) and revenue (€). In the squid hand-jig line trials, severe depredation events (60%) markedly reduced catch and revenue. In the trammel net, catch weight and revenues were not significantly different in the test and control nets. Despite the absence of dolphin damage, the fish species that are part of the dolphin diet were more abundant in the test net. Our findings suggest that pinger effectiveness may be influenced by a variety of factors including dolphin species, season, habitat and fish species distribution. Notably, the discards of trammel nets account for nearly 50% of the catch and include potentially valuable bycatch species, like Sparisoma cretense, which however commands a low price on the local market. We suggest that together pingers and the local sale of non-target species could mitigate the economic loss due to dolphin damage, although this requires appropriate planning.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals undergo cycles of tissue ischemia and reperfusion during the dive response. Reperfusion injury can result in oxidative tissue damage and the activation of a pro-inflammatory immune response. The risk of oxidative damage is reduced by antioxidants. Our hypothesis is that the reported higher antioxidant defenses within marine mammal tissues provide additional protection in situations that produce oxidative stress, like inflammation, in comparison to terrestrial mammal tissues. Leukocytes were isolated from the whole blood of Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gilli) and humans (Homo sapiens) and were exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 10 ?g/mL) in vitro to simulate a pro-inflammatory challenge. Oxidative stress indicators, including superoxide radical (O2 ) production, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-Transferase (GST), as well as oxidative protein damage, were quantified by spectrophotometry. Following 48 h under experimental conditions, bottlenose dolphin leukocytes produced 1.9 times more O2 but displayed 2.0 times lower protein carbonyl concentrations compared to human leukocytes. Following 48 h under experimental conditions, bottlenose dolphin leukocytes displayed 7.9, 2.0, 11.1, and 3.3 times more activities of CAT, GPx, GR, and GST, respectively, compared to human leukocytes. These results suggest that, under cell culture conditions, the antioxidant defenses in bottlenose dolphin leukocytes provide additional protection against pro-inflammatory challenges in comparison to human leukocytes, likely as an adaptive advantage. © 2021 Centro Regional de Invest.

ABSTRACT: Although dolphins are mostly known to form single species groups of varying size, occasionally they aggregate in mixed-species groups. The presence of mixed-species delphinid groups along the Peruvian coast is unknown. Herein, we report the presence of a single pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) within large groups of the long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) at Los Organos in the northern coast of Peru. Sightings occurred on October 10th, 2016, January 7th, 2018 and September 21st, 2019. In one sighting the mixed group was feeding, while during the other two sightings the group was travelling. These records add new evidence about mixed-species delphinid groups in coastal waters of Peru. © 2021, Universidad De Valparaíso, Chile. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Many species and populations of odontocetes have modified their behaviour to take advantage of feeding opportunities provided by fishing activities, with depredation of fishing gear being the most common type of adaptation. The northern Adriatic Sea has been identified as an important marine mammal area because of a regular occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins. Boat surveys were conducted within a 3,000 km2 sector of the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Veneto, Italy, between April and October 2018–2019. Based on 76 days at sea, 10,711 km of navigation, and 81 h 26 min of dolphin tracking, this study contributes novel quantitative information on dolphin spatial distribution, and on their occurrence in the wake of beam trawlers, otter trawlers, and midwater pair trawlers. A combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation framework indicated that trawling—along with other physiographic, biological and anthropogenic variables—influenced dolphin distribution. In days of trawling, the chance of encountering dolphins increased by ~4.5 times (95% confidence interval 1.8–11.0) near active beam trawlers, by ~16.0 times (7.1–36.0) near otter trawlers, and by ~28.9 times (12.0–69.6) near midwater pair trawlers. Spatial modelling was used to create maps of predicted distribution, suggesting differences in habitat use between trawling and no-trawling days. Spatial modelling for all days identified a dolphin distribution hotspot of 832 km2, situated off the Po river delta. Evidence contributed by this study can be used to inform management action within one of the world's areas most heavily impacted by fishing and other human encroachment. Such management action would help enforce the European Union's Habitats Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive, while also informing EU's Maritime Spatial Planning. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In this study, the C-turning, pitching, and flapping propulsion of a robotic dolphin during locomotion were explored. Considering the swimming action required of a three-dimensional (3D) robotic dolphin in the ocean, we propose a maneuverability model that can be applied to the flapping motion to provide precise and stable movements and function as the driving role in locomotion. Additionally, an added tail joint allows for the turning movement with efficient parameters obtained by a fluid-structure coupling method. To obtain a mathematical model, several disturbance signals were considered, including systematic uncertainties of the parameters, the perpetually changing environment, the interference from obstacles with effective fuzzy rules, and a sliding mode of control. Furthermore, a combined strategy of environment recognition was used for the positional control of the robotic dolphin, incorporating sonar, path planning with an artificial potential field, and trajectory tracking. The simulation results show satisfactory performance of the 3D robotic dolphin with respect to flexible movement and trajectory tracking under the observed interference factors.  © 2021 Zhibin Xue et al.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans accumulate persistent and toxic substances such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers in their tissue. PBDEs are ubiquitous in marine environments, and their exposure to mammals is linked to numerous health effects such as endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and fetal toxicity. However, the toxicological effects and mechanism of toxicity in cetaceans remains poorly understood. The effects of BDE-47 (0.1–0.5 μg mL−1), BDE-100 (0.1–0.5 μg mL−1), and BDE-209 (0.25–1.0 μg mL−1) exposure on cell viability, oxidative stress, mitochondrial structure, and apoptosis were evaluated using a recently established pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) skin fibroblast cell line (PSD-LWHT) as an in vitro model. However, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased following exposure to 1.0 μg mL−1 PBDE while superoxide anion, hydroxyl radicals, and inducible nitric oxide increased in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.5–1.0 μg mL−1, PBDEs significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, exposure to BDE-47 and -209 significantly affected mitochondrial structure as well as cell signaling and transduction compared to BDE-100. Although PBDE exposure did not affect cell viability, a significant increase in cell apoptosis markers (Bcl2 and caspase-9) was observed. This study demonstrated that BDE-47, -100, and −209 congeners might cause cytotoxic and genotoxic effects as they play a crucial role in the dysregulation of oxidative stress and alteration of mitochondrial and cell membrane structure and activity in the fibroblast cells. Hence, these results suggest that PBDEs might have adverse health effects on cetaceans inhabiting contaminated marine environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Comparative studies can help identify selective pressures that contributed to species differences in the number and composition of personality domains. Despite being adapted to an aquatic lifestyle and last sharing a common ancestor with primates some 95 million years ago, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) resemble nonhuman primate species in several behavioral and cognitive traits. For example, like chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), dolphins live in fission–fusion societies, use tools, and have relatively large brains. To determine the extent to which these and other factors contribute to the evolution of dolphin personality, we examined personality structure in 134 bottlenose dolphins. Personality was measured in 49 dolphins using a 42-item questionnaire, and in 85 dolphins using a version of the questionnaire that included 7 additional items. We found four domains. Three—Openness, Sociability, and Disagreeableness—resembled personality domains found in nonhuman primates and other species. The fourth, Directedness, was a blend of high Conscientiousness and low Neuroticism and was unique to dolphins. Unlike other species, but like humans, dolphins did not appear to have a strong Dominance domain. The overlap in personality structure between dolphins and other species suggests that selective pressures, such as those related to group structure, terrestrial lifestyles, morphology, and social learning or tool use are not necessary for particular domains to evolve within a species.

ABSTRACT: The largest unusual mortality event of cetaceans recorded in the Gulf of Mexico occurred from 2010 to 2014. The majority of mortalities were Tursiops truncatus (Common Bottlenose Dolphin) that stranded near Barataria Bay, LA, an area heavily oiled by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The purpose of this study was to identify the diet of dolphins that stranded in and near Barataria Bay from 2010 to 2012. Micropogonias undulatus (Atlantic Croaker) was the most frequently occurring (86.5%) and numerically abundant (34.2 ± 33.4%) prey in stomachs examined. Abundance of Engraulidae, Mugilidae, and Sciaenidae varied by season. Benthic prey and presence of sediment indicate that dolphins in Barataria Bay forage along the bottom of the bay, which could lead to long-term exposure to oil. © 2021 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin-Assisted Therapies (DAT) are alternative therapies aimed to reduce anxiety levels, stress relief and physical benefits. This paper is focused on measuring and analyzing dolphins brain activity when DAT is taking place in order to identify if there is any differences in female dolphin’s neuronal signal when it is interacting with control or intervention subjects, performing our research in Delfiniti, Ixtapa, Mexico facilities. We designed a wireless and portable electroencephalographic single-channel signal capture sensor to acquire and monitor the brain activity of a female bottle-nose dolphin. This EEG sensor was able to show that dolphin activity at rest is characterized by high spectral power at slow-frequencies bands. When the dolphin participated in DAT, a 23.53% increment in the 12–30 Hz frequency band was observed, but this only occurred for patients with some disease or disorder, given that 0.5–4 Hz band keeps it at 17.91% when there is a control patient. Regarding the fractal or Self-Affine Analysis, we found for all samples studied that at the beginning the dolphin’s brain activity behaved as a self-affine fractal described by a power-law until the fluctuations of voltage reached the crossovers, and after the crossovers these fluctuations left this scaling behavior. Hence, our findings validate the hypothesis that the participation in a DAT of a Patient with a certain disease or disorder modifies the usual behavior of a female bottle-nose dolphin. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Adriatic Sea is one of the Mediterranean areas most heavily impacted by fishing and other human stressors. The northern part of the basin has been certified as an Important Marine Mammal Area because of the regular occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. Boat surveys, totalling 76 days at sea and 10,711 km of navigation, were conducted between April 2018 and October 2019 to assess cetacean abundance within a 3,000-km2 area off Veneto, Italy. Bottlenose dolphins – the only marine mammal species observed – were encountered on 52 days and were tracked for 81 h and 26 min, resulting in 15,066 dorsal fin photographs of high quality and resolution. Various capture–recapture models were applied on individual photo-identification datasets. Model-based estimates indicate that approximately 600 individuals occurred within the study area during the sampling period in both years. Abundance varied monthly: minimum estimates were obtained in May 2018 (291 individuals; 95% CI 134–630) and May 2019 (121; 95% CI 20–721), whereas maximum estimates were obtained in September 2018 (385; 95% CI 310–477) and October 2019 (494; 95% CI 378–645). Evidence provided by this study can be used to complement and validate coarse ‘snapshot’ information from recent aerial surveys of the entire Adriatic Sea, and to enforce management action mandated by the European Community (EC) Habitats Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive, as well as guiding the EC’s Maritime Spatial Planning. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Two world’s largest Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) populations are both in Guangdong province, China, but its suitable habitat there has not been evaluated. We used MaxEnt to predict the suitable habitat of humpback dolphins in Guangdong based on environmental variables and sighting data. A total of 5,545.9 km² of suitable habitat (probability ≥0.5) was estimated to be available for humpback dolphins, mainly occurring in waters of the Pearl River estuary (the Pearl River Estuary and west, Hengqin Island-Chuanshan Islands-Mausoleum Island, approximately 3,637.6 km²), waters near Zhanjiang (Leizhou Bay, Zhanjiang Port, and Jianjiang Estuary, approximately 1,852.7 km²), and those near Chaozhou-Shantou (waters near Guang’ao Bay and Nan’ao Island, approximately 55.6 km²). Currently, only 8.89% of the suitable habitat for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins is under protection. Therefore, we propose extending the range of current nature reserves and establishing new nature reserves in the suitable habitat area. ©NWJZ, Oradea, Romania, 2021

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility to apply photo-identification method on the striped dolphin. As non-invasive and inexpensive methods, the photo-identification could improve our knowledge about abundance, temporal distribution, movements, social organization of striped dolphin population in the Gulf of Taranto. In this work, two different criteria were tested to identify individuals: the first based on the dorsal fin, the second based on the pigmentation pattern variability and long-term markers on the body.Multiple notches and multiple nicks resulted the most useful markers on dorsal fin for the photo-identification of striped dolphin, followed by the presence of one large notch, one small nick and deformities. These markers allowed the identification of 150 striped dolphins of which 40 were re-sighted from 2 to 7 times. The photo-identification based on the pigmentation pattern resulted in 47 individuals of which only one was resighted during the study period. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Studying the variables that describe the spatial ecology of threatened species allows us to identify and prioritize areas that are critical for species conservation. To estimate the home range and core area of the Endangered (EN) Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis, 23 individuals (6f, 17m) were tagged during the rising water period in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins between 2017 and 2018. The satellite tracking period ranged from 24 to 336 d (mean ± SE = 107 ± 15.7 d), and river dolphin movements ranged from 7.5 to 298 km (58 ± 13.4 km). Kernel density estimates were used to determine minimum home ranges at 95% (K95 = 6.2 to 233.9 km2; mean = 59 ± 13.5 km2) and core areas at 50% (K50 = 0.6 to 54.9 km2; mean = 9 ± 2.6 km2). Protected areas accounted for 45% of the K50 estimated core area. We observed dolphin individuals crossing country borders between Colombia and Peru in the Amazon basin, and between Colombia and Venezuela in the Orinoco basin. Satellite tracking allowed us to determine the different uses of riverine habitat types: main rivers (channels and bays, 52% of recorded locations), confluences (32%), lagoons (9.6%), and tributaries (6.2%). Satellite monitoring allowed us to better understand the ecological preferences of the species and demonstrated the importance of maintaining aquatic landscape heterogeneity and spatial connectivity for effective river dolphin conservation. © 2021 The authors.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin and whale watching has become worldwide a popular ecotourism activity. However, it can itself be a source of disturbance/stress to animals. Therefore, it is necessary quantify its impacts on cetacean species and possible behavioural responses to interaction between vessels and cetaceans. This study provided first preliminary information of the possible impact of a research vessel on behavioural activity of the Risso's dolphin recorded in the Gulf of Taranto from April 2019 to September 2020. Information about positive, neutral and responses of Risso's dolphins to research vessel was collected according focal-group protocol with instantaneous scan-sampling during 60 sightings, for a total of 300 sampling sessions of 3-min. Travelling resulted the most observed activity state (62%) followed by resting (24%), socializing (7%) and feeding (7%). A neutral response were observed in 81.3% of cases, a negative one in 17% of cases and positive in 1.7% of cases. For each activity state recorded, the most observed behavioural response was neutral, followed by negative reaction. Results provided in this study seems to indicate that Risso's dolphins displayed a neutral response in the most of sightings. However, further studies are necessary to better understand if the presence of whale watching vessels may induce changes, and to what degree, in the essential behaviour of this and other species occurring in the area. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Commerson’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), Peale’s dolphin (Lagenorhynchus australis), dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), and hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) are closely related species occurring in the Southern Hemisphere. Even though they are partially sympatric, they have evolved towards diverse foraging strategies, prey, and habitat preferences. Size variation occurs both among and within species. Our goal was to study the allometric patterns and ontogenetic trajectories in the vertebral column of these dolphins related to their ecology. We choose nine functionally homologous vertebrae in each column and digitized five different tridimensional configurations, containing 28 to 41 landmarks depending on the functional region under analysis. We explored different levels of allometry (static, ontogenetic, and evolutionary) using multivariate regressions of shape vs. log-transformed centroid size. We compared ontogenetic allometry regression vectors to evidence differences in growth patterns. Finally, we calculated Procrustes distances of shape configurations to determine the timing of shape shifts. Of the studied species, When compared to the Lagenorhynchus species, Commerson’s dolphin showed the highest degrees of allometry, both static and ontogenetic. The macroevolutive trends indicate a high degree of evolutionary morphological change, which could be associated with the rapid evolutionary radiation proposed for the group. This is the first time that allometric changes are studied in small cetaceans by means of 3D geometric morphometrics. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Recent genetic and morphological studies have indicated an incipient ecological divergence between 2 ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus in the Southwestern Atlantic. However, genetic variation is not the only molecular mechanism that alters the phenotype of these animals: epigenetics can also influence phenotypic plasticity, as well as the ecological adaptation and divergence of natural populations. Nevertheless, very little is known about the role that epigenetics plays in the population ecology of marine mammals. In this work, we tested whether there are differences in DNA methylation patterns between a coastal and an offshore ecotype of common bottlenose dolphin. Methylation patterns were analyzed using the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism technique on biopsy samples collected from animals of both ecotypes. We found consistent differences in DNA methylation patterns between coastal and offshore individuals. We also confirmed the genetic differences described in previous studies, indicating that the divergence between ecotypes has both genetic and epigenetic components. Our data show that it is possible to differentiate animals from the coastal and offshore ecotypes using DNA methylation markers, supporting the hypothesis that contrasting environments - which are decisive for the ecological divergence of these populations - lead to epigenetic modifications in common bottlenose dolphins. © Inter-Research 2021.

ABSTRACT: Coastal dolphins inhabiting areas influenced by human activities can face anthropogenic threats, so monitoring surveys to detect changes in abundance are required. Photo-identification surveys of IndoPacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) were conducted from 2001 to 2013 in the waters south of Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, Japan, where a few dozen dolphins emigrated from the waters north of the island. We report the range, the group composition, the number of individuals, and the breeding of the dolphins settled in the new area. The dolphins were found only in narrow straits between islands. One strait was the core habitat area. Two types of groups were observed: groups with females (range of group size = 15 to 29) and those without females (range of group size = 1 to 3). The total number of dolphins gradually decreased from 31 individuals in 2001 to 18 in 2011, which was mainly attributed to the reduction in the male number from 17 to 8. Few new immigrants to the area were found. In 2009, a temporary invasion by large groups of dolphins inhabiting the northern original area occurred. After the temporary invasion started to occur, we did not observe new calves nor calves that survived to the next year. The breeding had been successful except for the first two years after the settlement. The presence of the much larger group might have negatively impacted the maternal feeding environment. It was possible that the environmental deterioration due to the red tide, which can affect fish survival, was progressing. Two females disappeared in 2011, and all the remaining dolphins disappeared in 2012. Certain dolphins were found in other areas. In the present study, the process behind the dolphins' population range expansion is examined along with factors that may have hindered the colonization process. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Decompression theory has been mainly based on studies on terrestrial mammals, and may not translate well to marine mammals. However, evidence that marine mammals experience gas bubbles during diving is growing, causing concern that these bubbles may cause gas emboli pathology (GEP) under unusual circumstances. Marine mammal management, and usual avoidance, of gas emboli and GEP, or the bends, became a topic of intense scientific interest after sonar-exposed, mass-stranded deep-diving whales were observed with gas bubbles. Theoretical models, based on our current understanding of diving physiology in cetaceans, predict that the tissue and blood N2 levels in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) are at levels that would result in severe DCS symptoms in similar sized terrestrial mammals. However, the dolphins appear to have physiological or behavioral mechanisms to avoid excessive blood N2 levels, or may be more resistant to circulating bubbles through immunological/biochemical adaptations. Studies on behavior, anatomy and physiology of marine mammals have enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms that are thought to prevent excessive uptake of N2. This has led to the selective gas exchange hypothesis, which provides a mechanism how stress-induced behavioral change may cause failure of the normal physiology, which results in excessive uptake of N2, and in extreme cases may cause formation of symptomatic gas emboli. Studies on cardiorespiratory function have been integral to the development of this hypothesis, with work initially being conducted on excised tissues and cadavers, followed by studies on anesthetized animals or trained animals under human care. These studies enabled research on free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, FL, and off Bermuda, and have included work on the metabolic and cardiorespiratory physiology of both shallow- and deep-diving dolphins and have been integral to better understand how cetaceans can dive to extreme depths, for long durations. © Copyright © 2021 Fahlman, Moore and Wells.

ABSTRACT: Identifying threatened populations and quantifying their vulnerability is crucial for establishing priorities for conservation and providing robust information for decision-making. Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins have been long subjected to by-catch mortality in gillnet fisheries in coastal waters of southern Brazil, particularly in the Patos Lagoon estuary (PLE) and adjacent coastal waters, where dolphins from three populations (or Management Units) show overlapping home ranges. In this study we used a stage-classified matrix population model to conduct a demographic analysis of the PLE’s population with life-history data estimated through an 8 years mark-recapture study. A population viability analysis (PVA) was used to run a series of simulations where the risk was assessed under different by-catch scenarios, taking into account the effects of parameter uncertainty and stochasticity in the projections. In the absence of by-catch, we estimated that this dolphin population would growth at a rate of about 3% annually (95% CI: 1.2–5.8%). Under current by-catch rates, prognoses indicated high probabilities of viability over the next 60 years. These optimistic prognoses appear to be associated with the high survival of adult females. However, the eventual removal of very few mature females (one every year or two) would result in a prominent likelihood of decline from its current abundance at all pre-specified levels. The viability of the population would be substantially improved if the survival of juveniles/sub-adults could be increased. This may be achieved through the recently implemented dolphin protection area, which prohibits gillnet fisheries in the core area of this population. If the protection area reduces the entanglement rates of the most impacted life-stages (i.e., juvenile/sub-adult dolphins), there would be a substantial chance of the PLE’s dolphin population increasing above 20% of its current size, which is here proposed as conservation goal. If met, this goal has the potential to promote habitat quality, increase genetic diversity and connectivity with adjacent populations, enhancing the ability of bottlenose dolphins in southern Brazil to cope with environmental change and potential disease outbreaks. © Copyright © 2021 Fruet, Möller and Secchi.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a threatened coastal flagship species in Asian marine ecosystems, but the distribution of its suitable habitat remains unclear. In the present study, we characterized habitat relationships and predicted potential suitable habitats for humpback dolphins in the Beibu Gulf of China and Vietnam. Maximum entropy modeling identified six discontinuous areas in the Beibu Gulf, with a total area of 4396.8 km2, as suitable habitats for humpback dolphins. Of these, three suitable habitats covering 3948.7 km2 were known habitats, and three others covering an area of 448.1 km2 at the border of China and Vietnam or in Vietnamese waters (Beilun River Estuary, Qinghua, and Rongshi) were newly identified. Exploratory line-transect surveys are strongly recommended to determine whether dolphins are present in these three areas. The predicted suitable habitat showed seasonal variation, which increased slightly in the dry season compared with that in the wet season. Bathymetry is the most important predictor for habitat suitability, in line with the known coastal distribution of humpback dolphins. Our research predicted specific suitable habitat distributions which can be used to develop practical protection measures, such as the establishment of marine protected areas for this species to monitor, mitigate, or prohibit harmful anthropogenic activities. © 2021 Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.

ABSTRACT: The Shannon Estuary in Ireland is home to a resident population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive. It is an important industrial area, with numerous deep-water berths for shipping. Despite its high conservation value, there are few published studies on habitat use or foraging behavior of the Shannon dolphins throughout the year. The present study assessed the year-round presence and foraging activity of bottlenose dolphins at different locations in the middle and inner estuary using static acoustic monitoring. Dolphin presence was found to decrease with increased distance from the estuary mouth, i.e., where the estuary meets the Atlantic Ocean, while at the same time, foraging was found to be considerably higher in the upriver areas, suggesting the inner estuary was an important foraging area. Model predictions for seasonal, tidal and diel foraging were highly variable across locations, indicating that changes in dolphin behavior occurred over relatively small geographical scales. These results indicate that conservation efforts should consider the Shannon Estuary as a dynamic aggregation of habitats and future development initiatives should attempt to mitigate disturbance to the dolphins during important foraging periods on seasonal and diel scales. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Among the many hyper-longirostrine dolphins (Odontoceti) from the Miocene, members of the family Eurhinodelphinidae bear two highly distinctive cranial features: a long and edentulous premaxillary portion of the rostrum and a mandible that is significantly shorter than the rostrum. Until now, unambiguously attributed members of this clade were only recorded from early to middle Miocene deposits of the North Atlantic realm (east coast U.S.A., North Sea Basin, and Mediterranean). In this work we describe and compare two partial skulls of longirostrine dolphins from late early Miocene (Burdigalian, 19.25-18 Ma) marine deposits of the Chilcatay Formation, in the East Pisco Basin (southern coast of Peru), preserving rostral and mandibular material, as well as ear bones. Based on these specimens we report diagnostic remains attributable to this family for the first time for the whole Southern Hemisphere and the whole Pacific Ocean. This major expansion of eurhinodelphinids’ palaeogeographic distribution contrasts with their proposed shallow-water, coastal environments; it suggests a new dispersal route for members of the family across the Central American Seaway; and it further highlights the similarities between the odontocete faunas of the southeastern Pacific and North Atlantic realm during the Miocene. Better-preserved eurhinodelphinid specimens from the odontocete-rich Chilcatay Formation will allow for a more detailed comparison with North Atlantic members of the family. © 2021 Universita degli Studi di Milano.

ABSTRACT: Common dolphins in the Mediterranean have seen declines in recent decades, with increased fragmentation and patchiness, generally attributed to a range of anthropogenic threats. Despite this, few attempts have been made to identify critical areas of dolphins. One such area with heavy overlap of human threats and cetaceans is the Istanbul Strait. The current study presents the findings of a long-term, continuous survey effort that provides the first fine-scale, seasonal distribution and encounter rates of common dolphins for the Istanbul Strait. Land- and Boat-based surveys were conducted systematically between 2011 and 2013 with opportunistic boats surveys completed in 2020. A custom Python script divided the Strait into 500m2 grid cells, before compiling the total hours of survey effort in each cell to enable calculation of seasonal encounter rate. Dolphins were distributed throughout the Strait with distribution varying seasonally. The majority of the strait was used by dolphins in the summer, with only the north used in winter. Encounter rate also varied by season, with the highest mean encounter rate across grid cells of 1.9 individuals/hour in the summer and just 0.07 individuals/hour in winter. The results provide baseline seasonal data for the area and identify the northern area of the Strait as important across all seasons. As previous studies on cetaceans have identified vessel type, vessel speed, intensity of marine traffic, and distance from the dolphin group having an effect on cetaceans, protection is recommended in the north with seasonal management suggested in the central region in spring and summer. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) suffers from the lack of research in the Southern Adriatic Sea. In 2012, a decline of 50% of bottlenose dolphins population in the Mediterranean Sea was reported. In order to further our understanding of the spatial ecology of bottlenose dolphins in the southern Adriatic Sea, a four-year photo-identification study (starting in 2016) was carried out in Montenegro. Our results showed no permanent residency in Montenegro of any identified individual. Despite the low site fidelity, certain individuals were sighted each year throughout the survey. Key natural habitats for bottlenose dolphins were found all along the Montenegrin coast with notable preferences for Ulcinj, Bar, and the Boka Kotorska Bay. Although the lack of data in the previous decade prevented us from inferring population trends, annual abundance estimation revealed a constant decline from 116±17 in 2017 to 79±21 in 2019. The current study provides critical information on the population status of bottlenose dolphins in Montenegro, with a worrying decline recorded between 2016 and 2019 which could be attributed to the natural causes and/or increased human activities in Montenegro, ranging from coastal destruction to oil and gas explorations. Future research has to assess the present threats on the species while following a transboundary approach to understand the home ranges of species and to investigate the presence of possible habitat shifts. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Serum protein electrophoresis is commonly used in veterinary medicine to obtain a broad picture of acute phase and humoral immune responses. Agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) has been the most prevalent platform in laboratory set tings; however, in human medicine, this method is becoming increasingly supplanted by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). CZE has been demonstrated to have superior accuracy in fraction quantitation as well as consistently resolved protein fractions that are generally not observed by AGE. The objectives of the current study were to compare these two methods using serum from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and to generate preliminary reference intervals for this species. The methods were compared using Spearman’s correlation, Passing–Bablok regression, and Bland Altman analysis. A varying but significant correlation was observed between the methods for all protein fractions and the albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio except for the beta globulin fraction. Comparable or better imprecision in fraction quantitation wasobserved for CZE. Constant and proportional error was detected for both alpha globulin fractions. Of note, CZE allowed for an easier definition of the beta globulin fraction into two fractions (beta 1 and beta 2 globulins), and other subfractions were also visible. In total, these statistical and visible differences indicate that the two methods are not equivalent which necessitates the generation of method-specific reference intervals. Additionally, as it becomes more widely available, CZE should be considered as the preferred method for electrophoresis in this species. © 2021, Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: On March 2, 2005 ~70 rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) mass stranded along mud flats and associated canals on the Atlantic Ocean side of Marathon Key, Florida. Forty-six were necropsied and placed into two groups for analysis: Group-1 animals (N = 34; 65%) that died prior to medical intervention and rehabilitative efforts and Group-2 animals (N = 12; 35%) that died in rehabilitation. Thirty-four animals were females (18 adults, 5 juvenile/subadult, 7 calves, and 4 of undetermined age) and 12 were males (6 adults, 4 juvenile/subadults, 1 calf, and 1 of undetermined age). Body condition overall was fair to good in Group-1 and fair to poor in Group-2. Lesions were observed in multiple body systems. Greater than 90% of animals in both groups had respiratory lesions. Verminous sinusitis and bronchopneumonia were 2–3 times more prevalent in Group-2. Capture/exertional rhabdomyolysis was observed in Group-2 (42%). Vacuolar hepatopathies were observed in both groups including hepatic lipidosis (Group-1) and mixed etiologies (Group-2). Pancreatic and gastrointestinal tract pathologies were prevalent in Group-2 animals 56 and 75%, respectively, and included gastritis, gastric ulceration, enterocolitis, pancreatic atrophy, and pancreatitis related to physiologic stress. Group-2 more frequently had evidence of hemorrhagic diathesis present which included increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in various organs, increased hemosiderosis, and hemorrhage and hemorrhagic drainage in various organs. Central nervous system disease, primarily edema, and mild inflammation were equally prevalent. Renal proteinuria, tubular necrosis, and pigmentary deposition were observed in Group-2. Dental attrition was observed in ~40% of the groups. Gammaherpesviral-associated pharyngeal plaques were observed in 46 and 54% of Group-1 and 2 animals, respectively. Other lesions observed were mild and incidental with a frequency rate <20%. The findings from this Steno stranding provide a unique window into baseline individual and population clinical conditions and additional perspective into potential clinical sequelae of rehabilitation efforts. © Copyright © 2020 Ewing, Rotstein, McLellan, Costidis, Lovewell, Schaefer, Romero and Bossart.

ABSTRACT: The prominence of seafood in Japan motivates close monitoring of its seas and marine lives for potentially pathogenic fungi. During the treatments of the male Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) for paracoccidioidomycosis ceti (PCM-C), 5 white and floccose colonies showing identical genotype and morphological characteristics were isolated from two skin biopsy samples of cutaneous granulomatous lesions in 2018. The isolates were identified as Parengyodontium album known as one of fungal species having abilities to produce industrially important proteases, and to become a causative agent for emerging mycosis based on morphological and molecular biological characteristics. These lesions consisted of non-malignant pearl-like structures of hyperplastic keratinocytes. Interestingly, although the isolates could grow at 35 °C, their DNA sequences were phylogenetically located in a cluster consisting of environmental and clinical isolates lacking the ability to grow at 35 °C, based on previous reports. The opportunistic infection we observed in the dolphin might be caused by immune disorder due to PCM-C. Notably, although P. album is recognized as non-harmful, and has significant industrial importance and antitumor activity, it has potential to cause not only superficial but also systemic infection, and presents difficulties in treatment because of its high resistance to antifungal compounds. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The potential value of protected areas for the conservation of cetaceans is widely recognized; however, few evaluation methods exist to assess their effectiveness. In this study, a modeling approach based on long-term mark-recapture/resight data was used to assess the effectiveness of a Brazilian reserve in protecting endangered Amazon River dolphins or boto (Inia geoffrensis), a species killed for use as fish bait. We built an annual discrete-time model with subdivisions based on hydrological periods and age classes. It included transition probabilities in and out of the reserve that were estimated utilizing multi-state mark-recapture models. To evaluate five reserve configurations, we re-estimated the transition probabilities to represent changes in the reserve boundaries. Model predictions showed that four scenarios, including one representing the existing boundaries, would be insufficient to protect the local boto population (no = 528) and a steep decline in abundance would occur in the next 50 years (0 ≤ n50 ≤ 108). However, one reserve configuration, encompassing both flooded forests and adjacent river habitats, and including beaches and channel/floodplain entrances, resulted in a nearly stable population in the same time frame (n50 = 515). These findings suggest that, with careful design and efficient management, protected areas could be an effective conservation tool for boto populations that exhibit site fidelity to Amazonian floodplains. With appropriate mark-recapture/resight data, the modeling framework employed could be extended to evaluate and design protected areas for populations of other species in other systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV; Paramyxoviridae) is the most significant pathogen of cetaceans worldwide. The novel “multi-host” Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis; GD)-CeMV strain is reported in South American waters and infects Guiana dolphins and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis). This study aimed to describe the pathologic findings, GD-CeMV viral antigen distribution and detection by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), and infectious comorbidities in 29 Guiana dolphins that succumbed during an unusual mass-mortality event in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, between November 2017 and March 2018. The main gross findings were lack of ingesta, pulmonary edema, ascites, icterus, hepatic lipidosis, multicentric lymphadenomegaly, as well as pneumonia, polyserositis, and multiorgan vasculitis caused by Halocercus brasiliensis. Microscopically, the primary lesions were bronchointerstitial pneumonia and multicentric lymphoid depletion. The severity and extent of the lesions paralleled the distribution and intensity of morbilliviral antigen. For the first time in cetaceans, morbilliviral antigen was detected in salivary gland, optic nerve, heart, diaphragm, parietal and visceral epithelium of glomeruli, vulva, and thyroid gland. Viral antigen within circulating leukocytes suggested this as a mechanism of dissemination within the host. Comorbidities included disseminated toxoplasmosis, mycosis, ciliated protozoosis, and bacterial disease including brucellosis. These results provide strong evidence for GD-CeMV as the main cause of this unusual mass-mortality event. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Robust abundance estimates of wild animal populations are needed to inform management policies and are often obtained through mark-recapture (MR) studies. Visual methods are commonly used, which limits data collection to daylight hours and good weather conditions. Passive acoustic monitoring offers an alternative, particularly if acoustic cues are naturally produced and individually distinctive. Here we investigate the potential of using individually distinctive signature whistles in a MR framework and evaluate different components of study design. We analyzed signature whistles of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, using data collected from static acoustic monitoring devices deployed in Walvis Bay, Namibia. Signature whistle types (SWTs) were identified using a bout analysis approach (SIGnature IDentification [SIGID] - Janik et al. 2013). We investigated spatial variation in capture by comparing 21 synchronized recording days across four sites, and temporal variation from 125 recording days at one high-use site (Aphrodite Beach). Despite dolphin vocalizations (i.e., echolocation clicks) being detected at each site, SWTs were not detected at all sites and there was high variability in capture rates among sites where SWTs were detected (range 0-21 SWTs detected). At Aphrodite Beach, 53 SWTs were captured over 6 months and discovery curves showed an initial increase in newly detected SWTs, approaching asymptote during the fourth month. A Huggins closed capture model constructed from SWT capture histories at Aphrodite Beach estimated a population of 54-68 individuals from acoustic detection, which overlaps with the known population size (54-76 individuals - Elwen et al. 2019). This study demonstrates the potential power of using signature whistles as proxies for individual occurrence and in MR abundance estimation, but also highlights challenges in using this approach. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The components of interpretation and education in whale/dolphin watching tours, besides providing leisure to the participants, are involved in the satisfaction and creation of an environmental awareness. This study aimed to understand the perception, learning and tendency to conservation attitudes of the participants of dolphin-watching in Fernando de Noronha (FN). Were applied 140 questionnaires with tourists after participating in dolphin watching tours in FN. Participants living in the southeastern region of Brazil (57.9%) and with College education (88.6%) were the majority among respondents. Although the dolphin is the main marketing figure for tourism in FN, “sun and beach” tourism was the most cited reason for the trip. The satisfaction declared by respondents was high for both the “Dolphins's Deck” (viewing platform) (94.4%) and the boat tour (83.1%). Respondents visiting the “Dolphins's Deck”, where the educational component is most evident, tended to provide more correct answers related to knowledge and legislation towards dolphins protection in FN. The opportunity to observe a charismatic animal in a natural environment, as occurs with the spinner dolphin in FN, makes it easier for tourist guides and managers to access the affective component of tourists. Providing clear and objective information for tourists may promote long-term changes in their behavior and attitude and contribute to the spinner dolphin protection and to the archipelago preservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Bather protection nets have been in place off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, since the 1950’s. Besides sharks, they also catch a number of other marine vertebrates, including dolphins, the majority of which are Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins Tursiops aduncus. Previous analyses of dolphin bycatch in the nets indicated the potential impacts on the local populations, but a lack of information on population structure has to-date hindered a more detailed assessment. A recent re-assessment of the status and population delineations of T. aduncus off South Africa prompted a re-examination of demographic, spatial, and temporal patterns of its catches in bather protection nets over a 36-year period (January 1980 to December 2015). In total, 1169 dolphins were caught, including a slightly greater number of females and juveniles than other sex-classes, raising concern about the potential long-term effects on population demographics. More dolphins were caught off the North than the South coast. Temporal trends indicate that the bycatch during June and July every year (peak Sardine Run period) as a percentage of overall dolphin bycatch has been steadily decreasing from 39.8% in 1980 to 13% in 2015. A large inter-annual fluctuation can be seen, probably as a result of the inter-annual intensity of the Sardine Run. Although our results do not indicate a long-term decline of the individual populations as previously predicted, revised abundance estimates and data on the demographics and movement patterns of the animals are urgently required to accurately assess the impact of bycatch on the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin populations off KZN and to advise conservation and management decisions going forward. © Copyright © 2020 Plön, Erbe and Wintner.

ABSTRACT: Harmful algal blooms produced by the phytoplankton species Karenia brevis and its associated neurotoxin, brevetoxin (PbTx), occur throughout the Gulf of Mexico and have had devastating impacts on co-occurring populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), an important marine sentinel species. The majority of documented impacts, however, are from the eastern Gulf of Mexico, with a critical lack of information on the degree and frequency of PbTx exposure in bottlenose dolphins from Texas coastal waters. This study documents PbTx exposure in Texas bottlenose dolphins between 2007 and 2017 and their association with co-occurring K. brevis blooms. PbTx was detected in 60% (n = 112) of the animals tested. Liver tissue samples had the highest frequency of detection (62%), followed by feces (41.4%) and gastric contents (30.4%). PbTx was not detected in urine or intestinal tissue. The concentration ranges of PbTx detected in feces (1.2–216, mean 38.4 ng/g), gastric contents (3.3–1016, mean 158 ng/g) and liver (0.6–52.4, mean 8.5 ng/g) samples were an order of magnitude less than values reported for Florida dolphins for the same sample types. The proportion of dolphins recovered within 4 weeks of a bloom that tested positive for PbTx (‘Bloom’ group; 75%) was significantly higher compared to those that were recovered 5–8 weeks after termination of a bloom (‘Post-Bloom’ group; 36%; p = 0.004). The proportion of PbTx-positive animals with no observed bloom association (‘Baseline’ group; 60%) was also significantly greater than the Post-Bloom group (p = 0.012). No significant difference in proportion of PbTx-positive animals was detected between Bloom and Baseline groups (p = 0.242). No significant differences in liver PbTx concentrations were observed between any pairwise combinations of the 3 exposure groups (p = 0.261). Overall, these findings suggest persistent PbTx exposure for many individuals in these populations, although the health impacts of such exposure are not known. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Serum albumin (SA), the most abundant protein in circulation, functions as a carrier protein, osmoregulator, and antioxidant. Generally, SA exerts its antioxidative effects by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Because marine mammals are superior divers, they are intermittently exposed to oxidative stress induced by rapid reperfusion of oxygen to ischemic tissues after the dive. Although several antioxidants in marine mammals have been described, SA activity remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative activity of SA in marine mammals by comparing features of the primary and steric structures, biochemical properties, and antioxidative activities of common bottlenose dolphin SA (DSA) and human SA (HSA). Our results revealed that DSA lacked free cysteine at position 34 that is important for the antioxidative activity of HSA; however, the antioxidative capacity and thiol activity of DSA were stronger than those of HSA. Circular dichroism spectra showed different patterns in DSA and HSA. Ultraviolet fluorescence intensities of DSA were higher than those of HSA, suggesting lower surface hydrophobicity of DSA. Additionally, DSA showed higher excess heat capacity than HSA. We then compared a homology model of DSA with a 3D model of HSA. Our results indicate that DSA was more unstable than HSA at least in the body-temperature range, probably due to the mode of molecules involved in the disulfide bonds and/or the lower surface hydrophobicity, and it may be related to the equivalent or stronger antioxidant potency of DSA. These data show that DSA is an effective antioxidant in the circulation of the dolphin. © Copyright © 2020 Suzuki, Anraku, Hakamata, Kishida, Ueda and Endoh.

ABSTRACT: Background: Aggressive interactions between bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) have been reported in different parts of the world since the late 1990s. In the Baltic Sea, harbor porpoises are the only native cetacean species, while bottlenose dolphins may appear there temporarily. In the fall of 2016, a solitary male photo-identified bottlenose dolphin stayed in the German Baltic Sea of Schleswig-Holstein for 3 months. During that time, the necropsies of the stranded harbor porpoises revealed types of trauma of varying degrees in six animals, which is unusual in this area. The purpose of this study was to determine if the appearance of the bottlenose dolphin could be linked to the trauma of the harbor porpoise carcasses. Results: Pathological findings in these animals included subcutaneous, thoracic and abdominal hemorrhages, multiple, mainly bilateral, rib fractures, and one instance of lung laceration. These findings correspond with the previously reported dolphin-caused injuries in other regions. Moreover, public sighting reports showed a spatial and temporal correlation between the appearance of the dolphin and the stranding of fatally injured harbor porpoises. Conclusion: Despite the fact that no attack has been witnessed in German waters to date, our findings indicate the first record of lethal interactions between a bottlenose dolphin and harbor porpoises in the German Baltic Sea. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first report of porpoise aggression by a socially isolated bottlenose dolphin. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We examined spatiotemporal trends of diet compositions and their relationship with pollutant accumulation levels in 46 weaning Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (n = 46) from 2004 to 2017 in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) based on blubber fatty acid signatures using quantitative fatty acid signature analysis in R (QFASAR). Fifty-one potential prey species were tested, among which 13 had a mean relative proportion greater than 1% in dolphin diets. Bombay duck was the predominant prey species, followed by Dussumier's thryssa and mullet, whereas other prey species were present at considerably reduced proportions in diets. The proportion of larger fishes (Bombay duck and mullet) in the diet has exhibited a significant decreasing trend in recent years, whereas the smaller fish (Dussumier's thryssa) steadily increased over the whole period, possibly due to the severe impacts of climate change and other human stressors on large fishes in estuarine waters. The proportions of Bombay duck in the diet were significantly and positively correlated with hepatic Cr levels in dolphins, whereas the temporal change in Bombay duck consumption mirrored that in the hepatic levels of several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, because Bombay duck was the most contaminated species among all the prey fishes. ©

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Eye sizes and retinal organization were studied in newborn and adult bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus. In the newborn animals, the eye optics and retinal organization were completely formed, including the presence of two zones of increased concentration of retinal ganglion cells. Adult animals had larger eye sizes as compared to the newborn ones, larger retinal thickness, larger retinal area, and more ganglion cells. The peak ganglion cell density in the newborn animals was higher than that in the adult ones; however, the retinal resolution differed insignificantly. It is shown that the postnatal development does not principally modify the eye organization but results in a quantitative shift of the main parameters. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this assessment is to advance our understanding in the spatial ecology of the resident inshore and offshore population of bottlenose dolphins in Golfo Dulce (GD) and Osa Peninsula Waters (OPW). Our approach used niche-based models (Phillips et al., 2006, Thorne et al., 2012, Friedlaender et al., 2011), which provided details of how dolphins use coastal and oceanic habitats, describing the factors that influence their distribution in the study area and identifying the critical habitats to be considered for management and conservation. Our analyses indicate several important aspects of the distribution of these two ecotypes of bottlenose dolphins. As expected in the study area, these two ecological races occur in close proximity, but differ in the structural factors of the habitat they occupy. The inshore population uses areas close to the mouths of the rivers as critical foraging habitats, being influenced by tidal cycles and seasonal changes in water temperature and salinity. The offshore population in oceanic habitats must rely on prey species found in rare but profitable patches, therefore pelagic dolphins in the open ocean would often need to travel long distances searching for these patches. Distribution models illustrating the difference in habitat use presented in this assessment are key to effective management of the marine mammals' diversity in Costa Rica. © 2020 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Information about pollution and its potential impact in Australian marine wildlife is scarce. To fill this knowledge gap, our study investigated concentrations of legacy pollutants as well as naturally produced methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) in blubber, liver, kidney and muscle of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) from two large inverse estuaries in South Australia from 1989 to 1995 and 2009–2014. Our results show that concentrations of most pollutant classes are relatively low compared to the literature but at the higher end of the ranges reported for marine mammals in Australia. Results for some individuals exceed toxicity thresholds indicative of immunotoxicity in marine mammals. It is important to note that concentrations of some compound classes, particularly PBDEs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), increased over a time interval of 20 years thereby placing more individuals at risk in recent years. Some of the highest concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were measured in juveniles, which may jeopardize their development and the success of future generations. These results indicate that legacy pollutants may play a role in the long-term health of T. aduncus and should be included in biomonitoring efforts. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act, common bottlenose dolphins along the United States Atlantic coast are managed as a series of 17 distinct stocks. To determine the status of each stock, the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) is compared with anthropogenic removals, primarily as a result of fisheries bycatch. Estimates of abundance, with associated measures of variance, are required to generate the PBR for each stock. The objectives of the current study were to estimate abundance for the Southern North Carolina Estuarine System Stock (SNCESS) of common bottlenose dolphins and to better define the southern boundary of this stock. To meet these objectives, photo-identification surveys were conducted during the summer and winter of 2014 in estuarine and nearshore coastal waters in southern North Carolina. The surveys extended 25km South of the defined southern stock boundary, along the northern South Carolina coast. One mark and one recapture survey were conducted for each season. Each survey was completed in four or five days and covered over 300km of survey tracklines. Dorsal fin images were processed and managed using FinBase, and only images of suitable quality and distinctiveness were used for estimates of abundance. A three-step decision tree was used to assign each dolphin group to either the SNCESS or an adjacent coastal stock, based on sighting location, ranging patterns derived from matches to photo-identification catalogues and statistical modelling. Only sightings classified as SNCESS were used to estimate stock abundance. Abundance estimates were calculated using three approaches: the Chapman modification to the Lincoln-Petersen method, package Rcapture in program R and program MARK 6.2. The most parsimonious approach was the Chapman LP method yielding an estimate of 272 dolphins (95% CI 189-390, CV = 0.32) in the summer of 2014. The distribution of SNCESS dolphins shifted South in the winter and several individuals were observed up to 70km southwest of the currently recognised southern boundary. The results of this study support the current definition of the SNCESS but suggest revisions to the southern boundary. The SNCESS is the smallest bottlenose dolphin stock off the East coast of the USA and is at risk of population decline as a result of fisheries-related mortality. © 2020 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: The Gulf of Ambracia, in northwestern Greece, hosts a highly threatened community of about 150 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Until now, information on their feeding habits was derived exclusively from fish scale samples collected during surface-feeding events targeting small schooling epipelagic fish. The aim of this study was to determine the diet of bottlenose dolphins living in the Gulf of Ambracia through the application of Bayesian isotopic mixing models. Skin biopsy samples of 16 dolphins were analyzed and no difference related to sex or age-class was found in δ13C and δ15N values. Results suggested that the dolphin diet was mainly based on Trachurus trachurus, species belonging to the family Sparidae: Diplodus annularis, Lithognathus mormyrus, and Sepia officinalis, which represented together about 42% ± 15% of the biomass ingested, followed by species belonging to the order Clupeiformes (Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardinella aurita, and Sardina pilchardus) and the genus Gobius (37% ± 17%). A better understanding of the feeding habits of these dolphins sheds light on the feeding ecology of this highly threatened population by, for instance, evidencing interactions with artisanal fisheries sharing the same target species, and is key for identifying adequate management measures consistent with an ecosystem-based approach. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: This study analyzed mtDNA sequences of two bottlenose dolphin subspecies found along the northern Patagonian coast, Argentina: the endangered Tursiops truncatus gephyreus and the data deficient Tursiops truncatus truncatus. Three haplotypes were recovered from nine samples. The most frequent haplotype represented the coastal morph, also two haplotypes showing falcate dorsal fin, a characteristic describing the oceanic morph. This finding suggests that both morphs may exist in sympatry in Argentina. Furthermore, sampling was extended beyond the species' previously known range, including individuals as far as seven hundred kilometers to the south. Therefore, new genetic data, despite being preliminary, hint at an unexpectedly higher genetic diversity of matrilines than previously anticipated.  © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

ABSTRACT: To assess whether behaviour can be inferred from echolocation trains (inter-click intervals) this study examines acoustic recordings of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins using Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Inter-click intervals from 17 groups of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins were monitored over a 36 day period in an area within the Cerro Verde (Marine Protected Area), Uruguay. Simultaneous visual observations were made from shore nearby. Results show that inter-click intervals in the echolocation trains had significant differences for three specific behaviours: Feeding, socialising and travelling. The natural environment was quiet, with no disturbances in the immediate vicinity from boats, drones or other man-made noises. © 2020 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We report for the first time the infection of dolphins with Ascocotyle longa found in the intestines of three different species, Sotalia guianensis, Steno bredanensis, and Tursiops truncatus gephyreus, which were found washed ashore along the southeastern and southern Brazilian coast. The worms were identified based on morphological and molecular data using the 28S rDNA gene and the COI gene. Specimens of A. longa from the pinniped Otaria flavescens were also analyzed. As the first isolation of A. longa from cetaceans, the present study increases the distribution area and range of definitive hosts of this trematode, and provides new molecular data to complement the phylogeny of the group in future studies, thus contributing to the scientific knowledge of this potentially zoonotic parasite. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: An unusual mortality event (UME) attributed to morbillivirus infection was identified in two Guiana dolphin populations from the Southeastern Brazilian coast. The aim of this study was to characterize total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) and selenium (Se) bioaccumulation and body burden in Guiana dolphins from Sepetiba Bay (RJ) collected before (n = 61) and during the UME (n = 20). Significantly lower Se concentrations were found in the livers of individuals collected during the UME (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.03), probably due to impairment of the detoxification process in the liver. There were differences in THg and Se concentrations in the organs and tissues of individuals (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.05), but not MeHg (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.07). For THg, the liver showed the higher concentrations and differed among organs and tissues analyzed such as blubber (Tukey's test for unequal N; p = 0.003). For Se concentrations, the skin and kidney presented the higher concentrations and varied among other tissues/organs, like muscle (Tukey's test for unequal N; p = 0.02). Differences in body burdens were observed among specimens collected previously and during the UME probably due to the remobilization and transport of the muscle-stored MeHg to other tissues/organs. This abrupt input of MeHg into the bloodstream may cause serious health damage. Indeed, evidences of methylmercury intoxication was observed in Guiana dolphins in Sepetiba Bay. In conclusion, bioaccumulation patterns, the detoxification process and body burden were affected by morbillivirus. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In animal societies with fission-fusion dynamics, demographic disturbances can influence the social and spatial structure of the population. Within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have experienced recurrent unusual mortality events (UMEs) providing an opportunity to examine postdisturbance population and social cluster restructuring. This study investigates the impact of the potentially nonepizootic 2008 UME on the IRL dolphin population. Photo-identification surveys conducted from August 2006 to May 2010 were stratified into pre- (August 2006–April 2008) and post-UME (September 2008–May 2010) time periods. Social network and spatial (univariate kernel density) analyses were limited to individuals sighted 5+ times per period (pre-UME = 183, post-UME = 134), and indicated a change from 11 to ten social clusters, although individuals did not always reassociate with pre-UME cluster associates. Despite the social and spatial disconnect between IRL proper and Mosquito Lagoon clusters, both network density and core area spatial overlap increased post-UME allowing for increased intercluster interactions. However, intracluster associations increased as well, allowing the population to maintain multiple social clusters within a loosely connected network. This study shows the important role sociality may play in the adaptability of cetaceans to environmental and demographic changes. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: We discuss new applications of baited remote underwater video (BRUV) systems based on recordings of Amazonian freshwater fauna during a long-term fish monitoring program in the Xingu River, Brazil. BRUVs facilitated estimates of relative abundance and frequency of occurrence for species of river turtles (Podocnemis unifilis, P. expansa, Rhinoclemmys punctularia), river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) in a variety of habitats including rocky rapids, submerged sandy beaches, an artificial reservoir and the Xingu Ria. © 2019 by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

ABSTRACT: Acoustics enable many core undersea capabilities. Where radio waves do not propagate well, and light is absorbed quickly, acoustic signals help us map, see, locate and communicate. The many products and technologies that employ acoustics all depend upon signal processing, thus new processing approaches can impact many applications. QinetiQ and its partner Optimal Systems Laboratory (OSL) have developed DOLPHINTM - a patented method using analog cancellation that eliminates receiver saturation and enables simultaneous transmit and receive, resulting in full duplex communications signals. Since the beginning of acoustic communications, the state of the art technology has been limited to half-duplex signals: transmit with the receiver off and then turn the transmitter off and receiver on and wait to receive. Half duplex has been required because the direct transmission at the source saturates the receiver electronics if both the transmitter and receiver are enabled simultaneously. On the other hand, the new DOLPHIN technology enables true full-duplex acoustic telemetry. It cancels the transmit signal at the receiver in real-time. This eliminates receiver self-signal saturation and enables simultaneous transmitting and receiving on the same frequency, with collocated transducers. The DOLPHIN technology is frequency and range independent - thus yielding flexible new approaches to underwater communications. This paper reviews the underlying DOLPHIN technology, initial field trials, recent simulation results and a preliminary open protocol concept. It concludes with a vision for future concepts of operations. © 2020 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are among the largest and most diverse predators in marine ecosystems, but our understanding of their foraging ecology, which is crucial for ecosystem management, is poor. Delphinus delphis (common dolphins) are found in tropical and temperate waters globally. Stomach content studies indicate they are opportunistic predators that feed locally on abundant small pelagic schooling fish, but information is lacking on how their diet may vary seasonally and with ontogeny. We investigated effects of body length, sex, season, and year on D. delphis diet in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope analysis of 56 skin samples collected during 13 years (2004−2016). Dolphin δ15N values changed with body length, suggesting ontogenetic dietary variation. Nitrogen isotope values were higher in austral autumn/winter compared to spring/summer, whilst δ13C values decreased throughout the study period, suggesting temporal changes in primary productivity likely affecting the dolphins’ diet. Sex had a minor effect on dolphin δ13C values, with male and female isotopic niches overlapping by 62.6% and 45.2% (respectively). Our results provide a baseline for detecting future changes in the trophic ecology of D. delphis in a key habitat in New Zealand and highlight their role as a sentinel species in this coastal ecosystem. © Inter-Research 2020

ABSTRACT: Proximity and synchronous behaviours from surface observations have been used to measure association patterns within and between dolphin dyads. To facilitate an investigation of relationship quality in dolphins, we applied a method used for primates and ravens that examined three main components to describe relationships: value, security, and compatibility. Using pilot data from long-term research of two study populations for this preliminary assessment, these three components were extracted from PCA of eight behavioural variables with more than 80 % variance accounted for in both study groups. Only pair swim position differed between groups. Although value, security, and compatibility are abstract terms, each is based on behaviours identified as important in dolphin social life, at least for these two populations. Examining relationship quality in dolphins with a method used to illustrate dyadic differences for primates and ravens allows for a quantitative, comparative assessment of sociality across disparate taxa. Although these species are diverse in their anatomies and in their social habitats (e.g., aquatic, terrestrial, aerial), they may well share the basic societal building blocks in the factors affecting how relationships are formed. We discuss how an examination of these behavioural variables facilitates understanding relationship quality in dolphins, as well as how dolphin relationships fit into the context of social animals’ society. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a species vulnerable to extinction. One population of this species, located in Xiamen Bay, China, has been extensively studied so as to estimate its abundance. However, the demographic dynamics of this population are not fully known. To study survival and the size of this population, monthly photo-identification surveys were conducted from August 2010 to July 2015. A total of 157 dolphin sightings were recorded and 60 individuals were successfully photo-identified for use in mark–recapture analysis. The super-population size estimated by POPAN modeling suggested that 64 individuals were present in Xiamen Bay during the study period, and the most recent annual population size was estimated at 58 individuals (using both a Huggins closed capture model and a POPAN model). A Cormack–Jolly–Seber model estimated an annual survival rate of 0.976, which remained constant throughout the study period. However, a low level of birth rate and/or calf survival, which was indicated by the low probabilities of entrance into marked population, may not support the long-term persistence of this population. Based on these findings, we propose that a comprehensive assessment of anthropogenic impacts on this population should be performed and actions should be taken accordingly, to limit mortality and increase the birth rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The skin disease paracoccidioidomycosis ceti occurs in several dolphin species globally. Infection by the unculturable fungi Paracoccidioides brasilensis or other Paracoccidioides spp. results in chronic cutaneous and granulomatous lesions. In this study we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies to Paracoccidioides spp. in captive dolphins from three aquaria in Japan. We had previously reported that there were serological cross-reactions for Paracoccidioides spp. with related species in the order Onygenales. We hypothesized that the degree of serological cross-reactions for Paracoccidioides spp. might be lower in areas, such as Japan, where the fungal diseases coccidiodomycosis and paracoccidiodomycosis are not endemic. Sera from 41 apparently healthy dolphins, including 20 Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (BD: Tursiops truncatus), 6 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (IPBD: Tursiops aduncus), 2 F1 generation of a cross between BD and IPBD (F1), 3 Pacific white-sided dolphins (PWD: Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), 2 pantropical spotted dolphins (PSD: Stenella attenuata), 6 false killer whales (FKW: Pseudorca crassidens), and 2 rough-toothed dolphins (RTD: Steno bredanensis) were investigated. Sera from three dolphins with paracoccidioidomycosis ceti were used as a positive control. The yeast-form cells of Paracoccidioides spp. in the cutaneous tissue sample derived from the first Japanese paracoccidioidomycosis ceti case were used as the antigen for the immunohistochemistry. Of the 41 dolphins tested, 61.0% had antibodies against Paracoccidioides spp. This indicates that dolphins of several species in Japanese aquaria have likely been exposed to the pathogen Paracoccidioides spp. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean populations are vulnerable to decline due to anthropogenic threats and life history traits. The Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) has been considered the most affected small dolphin in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. In this study a method is presented for estimating the growth rate of the Franciscana dolphin affected by incidental mortality (bycatch) in coastal marine areas of Argentina, South America. We used a general approach based on vital parameters information such as reproductive rates and survival probabilities for an age-structured population. The Franciscana's growth rate was estimated using Leslie's approach through an algorithm implemented in a 14 × 14 matrix model. Then, the population was characterized analysing the discrete-time evolution of the age–population vector. We found that the potential growth rate <1 indicates that Franciscanas in Argentina are susceptible to decline under current levels of incidental mortality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Litter is a well-known problem for marine species; however, we still know little about the extent to which they're affected by microplastics. In this study, we analyse the presence of this type of debris in Western Mediterranean striped dolphins' intestinal contents over three decades. Results indicated that frequency was high, as 90.5% of dolphins contained microplastics. Of these microplastics, 73.6% were fibres, 23.87% were fragments and 2.53% were primary pellets. In spite of the high frequency of occurrence, microplastic amount per dolphin was relatively low and highly variable (mean ± SD = 14.9 ± 22.3; 95% CI: 9.58–23.4). Through FT-IR spectrometry, we found that polyacrylamide, typically found in synthetic clothes, was the most common plastic polymer. Here, we establish a starting point for further research on how microplastics affect this species' health and discuss the use of striped dolphins as indicators of microplastics at sea. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis delphis) (SBCD) is an odontocete inhabiting the Gulf of California (GC), Mexico; distributed widely in temperate to tropical waters, it is sometimes observed close to shore or in shallower areas. On 13 February 2018, a mass stranding of 54 SBCDs occurred in La Paz Bay in the southern GC; 21 individuals died, but the rest were released. Skin samples were removed from dead individuals for stable isotope analysis in order to infer their probable geographical provenance. Their mean ± S.D. were 17.0 ± 0.3‰ (δ15N) and -18.3 ± 0.2 (δ13C), with no significant differences between sexes or length. These isotope ratios do not correspond to the GC. Their low δ13C and δ15N values reflect offshore foraging grounds not under the 15N-enriching effects of the intense denitrification in the GC. Rather, these values were within the range of other piscivorous odontocetes that have been sampled in the GC and classified as outsiders (Pacific Ocean). Mean total length of these stranded SBCDs was similar to that reported for SBCDs off the Pacific coast of Baja California and southern California, but widely smaller than that reported for both eastern tropical Pacific SBCDs and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis bairdii) in the northern and southern GC. These differences in isotopic niche and size between SBCDs stranded in La Paz Bay and long-beaked common dolphins from other regions of the GC highlight the need to be able to distinguish between the common dolphins (Delphinus) that inhabit the GC from those that visit the GC from off the Pacific coast of Baja California. Our findings confirm the ecological importance of the southern GC, where resident and visitor marine mammals congregate, leading to events like mass strandings that provide a unique source of information useful for research and conservation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The effects of liquefaction induced lateral spreading on the piles of a dolphin-type berth were investigated using 1 g large scale shake table testing accompanied by numerical simulations. For this purpose, various aspects of the response of the soil and the pile group to lateral spreading were considered. The results indicated that large bending moments were induced in the piles during lateral spreading and the downslope piles of the group received greater bending moments than the upslope one. The monotonic components of bending moments in the piles were reasonably predicted by the displacement based numerical approach using p-y springs when they were properly tuned for strength reduction in liquefied soil and the pile position in the group. A three dimensional hydro-mechanical finite element analysis was also undertaken in OpenSees which appropriately reproduced the physical model behavior. Lastly, a comprehensive parametric study on the verified finite element model revealed that the relative density of soil and the amplitude of base excitation can profoundly affect the induced bending moments in piles as well as the pile cap displacements while the effect of pile flexibility was comparably smaller in this regard. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: There is little information about the residue levels and congener composition of organic contaminants (OCs) in cetaceans. In the present study, we investigated the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the blubber, blood, brain and testes of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) stranded in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. The lowest blubber/tissue partition coefficients were found for sum hexachlorocyclohexanes (ΣHCHs) and ΣPAHs, while the highest were in ΣPCBs and sum dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (ΣDDTs), likely attributing to the octanol-water partition features. The low levels of OCs in brain and testes theoretically resulted from the blood-brain barrier, blood-testes barrier, contaminant molecule dimensions and unique lipid compositions in the brain and testes. Compared with other contaminants, the higher mean brain/blood and testes/blood partition coefficients found for mirex, heptachlor, dieldrin and endrin would increase the risks associated with exposure-related toxicity and the bioavailability of contaminants within these tissues. Observations also suggest that as lipid mobilizes from blubber, contaminants may redistribute, leading to elevated tissue (such as brain) concentrations. Therefore, dolphins with less blubber may be more susceptible to health risks. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins living in PRE are at great risk due to variety of OCs in indirect contact with non-target organisms, affecting the health of animals (toxic effects and accumulation). Our findings contribute to the knowledge of the potential effects of OCs exposure on developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive damage in marine mammals. The main finding of the work. Compared with other contaminants, the higher tissue/blood partition coefficients of mirex, heptachlor, dieldrin, and endrin in the brain and testes would increase the risks associated with exposure-related toxicity and the bioavailability of contaminants within these tissues. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In this study, we used a 10-year (2007–2016) mark-recapture dataset to investigate the potential effects of flooding and port development on the population dynamics of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis), inhabiting the Fitzroy River and Port Curtis, within the southern Great Barrier Reef region. A Multisite Capture-Recapture model was used to quantify population size and demographic parameters for both sexes and sites. Flood occurrence and intensity (both sites), and port development (Port Curtis) were included as explanatory variables. Abundance estimates indicated that about 77 adult dolphins were present in both sites, of which 69% were females. Most females (69%) were resident with a yearly recruitment close to zero for most years. Most males and unsexed (68%) individuals showed little evidence of long-term residency. The abundances of males and unsexed individuals varied between 15 and 20 dolphins in the Fitzroy River and 19–26 in Port Curtis, but the accuracy was too low to assess changes. Female abundances started at 56 in both sites and declined to about 32 per site in 2011, coinciding with port development construction activities and a concurrent major flood. In Port Curtis, the number of females returned to their original levels once the port development was completed in 2013. In the Fitzroy River, the declining trend continued and reached the lowest estimated abundance of 29 in 2016. As port developments and floods are expected to increase along the Queensland coastal region over coming decades, the results of this study highlight increasing concerns about the vulnerability and long-term sustainability of inshore dolphins in the GBR. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The present study represents the first reported boat-based photographic identification study of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) off the Wild Coast of southeast South Africa. This area is known for the annual sardine run, which attracts apex predators to the region during the austral winter. Dedicated photo-identification surveys were conducted along this coast at three different study sites in February, June, and November of each year from 2014 to 2016. During 47 surveys, 136 bottlenose dolphin groups were encountered, an estimated 4,474 dolphins observed, and 2,149 individuals were identified. Although most individuals (N = 1,770, 82.4%) were only observed once, some were resighted 2–7 times (N = 379, 17.6%), with an average of 305 days (range: 88–705 days) between resightings. The majority of bottlenose dolphins were resighted within the same study site (N = 192), indicating some degree of residency. However, 65 individuals were observed at two different study sites, indicating individual movements along the coast. Our findings contrast earlier suggestions that bottlenose dolphins only use the Wild Coast during the sardine run, as we found large number of animals year-round with some level of site fidelity. This highlights the importance of the Wild Coast to bottlenose dolphins and provides further information on their status off southeastern South Africa. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: A long-term study of a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) population inhabiting the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador (2°33′ S, 79°20′W), has been carried out for almost 30 years. Similarly, as in other parts of the world, this population is structured socially and spatially in well-defined subunits or communities. Two of these communities, referred to as Posorja and El Morro, have been studied with major intensity in the last 10 years in the western inner estuary, among others to calculate population parameters that allow assessing their viability in time. Calculated parameters include annual abundance, age and sex composition, annual crude birth rate, calf survival, calf production interval, and average annual mortality/emigration. With these parameters and others derived from other better-studied populations, the trend of both subunits was modeled using the software Vortex. Results show that even under an optimistic scenery both communities will be extinct in the short (Posorja) and mid-term (El Morro), if current stressors continue. Most population parameters calculated in both communities show similar values as in populations elsewhere, but a very low calf survival in Posorja and high mortality/emigration ratios in adults, and probably in juveniles in both communities, contribute to this trend. Population deterioration seems to be the result of different human-induced threats such as fisheries, maritime traffic and others still not well assessed, as well as stochastic demographic events. We recommend taking actions in the short term to halt population decline addressing the major causes of mortality affecting these dolphin communities. © Copyright © 2020 Félix and Burneo.

ABSTRACT: The Bolivian river dolphin, locally known as the bufeo, is the only cetacean in land-locked Bolivia. Knowledge about its conservation status and vulnerability to anthropogenic actions is extremely deficient. We report on the rescue and translocation of 26 Bolivian river dolphins trapped in a shrinking segment of the Pailas River, Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Several institutions, authorities and volunteers collaborated to translocate the dolphins, which included calves, juveniles, and pregnant females. The dolphins were successfully released into the Río Grande. Each dolphin was accompanied by biologists who assured their welfare. No detectable injuries occurred and none of the dolphins died during this process. If habitat degradation continues, it is likely that events in which river dolphins become trapped in South America may happen more frequently in the future. © 2020 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Social connectivity is important for measuring the fitness of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). While interactions in fission-fusion societies vary between individuals, studies show that repeated interactions enhance reproduction and foraging success. Injuries that potentially remove an individual from its association network may disrupt these interactions. Using data from the long-term resident dolphin community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, we investigated how anthropogenic injuries affect the dolphins' social associations by examining the differences before and after injury to individuals. We examined group size, strength, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient, and number of triangles and analyzed whether the animal's sex, age class, type of injury, or human intervention affected these values. We found that while group size did not change, injured dolphins had fewer preferred associates (HWI > 0.14) and were found in more fluid groups immediately after injury, but started returning to normal association levels after 2 years. This initial decrease in connectivity was not related to the age, sex, type of injury, or intervention. Despite the fluidity in individual associations, the strongest bonds remained stable, those between mothers and calves and those between male alliance partners. These findings provide some of the first information relating injuries and social networks for animals. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) are an endangered species. Thus, up-to-date information on the distribution pattern of dolphins is critical for its proper management and conservation. Using a towed passive acoustic monitoring device, the distribution pattern of the Irrawaddy dolphins in the middle reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar, was investigated during a vessel-based survey between Mingun and Katha. This region was successively divided into segments 1–4 from upstream to downstream. Sixteen echolocation encounters, with a series of click trains separated by <8 min and 26 dolphin acoustic trajectories were recorded. The mean dolphin detection rate (animals/kilometer) across the four segments progressively increased from upstream to downstream. High relative abundance was observed in segment 4 (46%) and segment 1 (23%) which was consistent with findings from historical boat-based visual surveys. The averaged interclick intervals of each click train in segment 2 and 4 was significantly shorter than that in segment 3, indicating that the dolphins in these segments frequently use shorter-ranged biosonar. More frequent and consistent surveys with a systematic sampling track design that incorporates other factors and covering the whole distribution range along the Ayeyarwady River and at varied water levels are needed in the future. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are sentinels of environmental health. Skin lesions may indicate disease and can be used to infer population health. We estimated the prevalence of skin lesions and identified major lesion types on coastal bottlenose dolphins in Roanoke Sound, North Carolina, over a 3-year period using photo-identification. Boat-based surveys were conducted from April 2012 through October 2014. High quality images of distinctive fins were examined for overall prevalence (P) of any skin lesion (n = 169, P = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.42–0.57). Lesion prevalence estimates varied little between years (2012 P = 0.45, 2013 P = 0.56, 2014 P = 0.52) and most lesions were observed in the spring (P = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.57–0.92). Of six lesion types examined, pale lesions were most common (P = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.30–0.52). Annual lesion prevalence estimates for dolphins in Roanoke Sound were comparable to published estimates for T. truncatus in Charleston, South Carolina, Brunswick, Georgia, and Sarasota, Florida (p ≥.05), although, seasonal differences in lesion occurrence and type were observed (p <.05). Future studies should examine relationships between lesions and environmental variables and use stranded dolphins to investigate skin lesion etiology. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Populations of endangered Ganges and Indus river dolphins have been under severe threat from diversion of river water by dams, barrages, and canal networks across the Indus and Ganges-Brahmaputra river basins. River dolphins prefer deep water and might enter irrigation canals in the dry-season, getting stranded there. Stranding can cause mortality and local population declines, and poses an emerging challenge to river dolphin conservation efforts. In Pakistan's Indus river basin, stranding rates of Indus dolphins in irrigation canals are high, and well-coordinated rescue-release operations are undertaken. Despite commendable river dolphin rescue efforts in some parts of India, stranding cases are not always reported. From open-access media reports (2007-08 to 2017-18), I found 26 stranding cases of Ganges river dolphins from the Ghaghara-Sharada canal network across seven districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Of these, 62% reports were from 2015 to 2016. Most cases occurred in secondary and tertiary canal branches. Interviews with fishers, farmers, and government officials revealed low awareness of stranding cases. Stranded dolphins might have no chance of returning to their source habitat, unless rescued. From my results, I discuss how current barrage-canal operations could influence dolphin stranding risk, and their implications for flow management in the Ghaghara-Sharada river basin.  © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

ABSTRACT: Sounds are particularly important for animals that live in complex social communities. In this study, we assessed the communication calls (whistles) that common bottlenose dolphins emit during their foraging activities in the absence and presence of motor boats and during dolphin depredation on trawlers, in Alghero (Sardinia, Italy) and Cres-Lošinj Archipelago (Croatia). The latter behaviour involves foraging on concentrated food sources during very noisy human activity and may require the emission of distinctive whistles. Thus, we investigated if whistle structure, in terms of frequency and time parameters, changes depending on these three foraging contexts. In Sardinia, during foraging in interaction with trawlers, whistles differed from those emitted during the other foraging contexts. Conversely, in Cres-Lošinj, significant variations in whistles were found to be related mainly to the presence of motor boats. This study represents the first report on how two dolphin populations adopt different acoustic tactics in the context of similar foraging behaviour. By investigating the effects of opportunistic foraging on acoustic repertoires, we provide new findings on the acoustic adaptation of dolphins to local conditions and contribute to understanding the relationships between dolphins and human activities, such as fishing and boat traffic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Although the use of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGCM) measurements as non-invasive biomarkers for the stress response in mammals has increased, few studies have been conducted in odontocetes. We investigated if animal sex, age, pregnancy or contextual variations (season, sampling time, enrichment, social separation and presence of visitors) influenced the FGCM concentrations in presumably healthy, captive and endangered Yangtze finless porpoises (YFPs, N = 4) and bottlenose dolphins (BDs, N = 3). For YFPs, the FGCM concentrations were influenced by season (p = 0.01), diurnal variation (p = 0.01) and pregnancy (p = 0.005). Contextual variables that were associated with increases in FGCM concentrations included social separations (p = 0.003) and numbers of visitors (p = 0.0002). Concentrations of FGCMs were lower (p = 0.001) after exposure to environmental enrichment. For BDs, enrichment was associated with reduced concentrations of FGCMs (p < 0.0001). The presence of visitors also influenced this species’ FGCM concentrations (p = 0.006). These results demonstrate that changes in the FGCM concentrations in YFPs and BDs may occur in response to contextual and social changes. In combination with other behavioral and physiological assessments, measurements of FGCMs may be a useful tool for monitoring cetacean welfare. Such monitoring may help researchers identify and better understand situations that may be stressful for animals and, therefore, improve management and husbandry. Furthermore, results from our study and inferences of the FGCM concentrations in cetaceans, and their potential relationship to stress, may be extrapolated to studies of free-ranging animals, which may help detect possible environmental or anthropogenic stressors that could be affecting these populations. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Twenty five morphometric characters of Coryphaena equiselis (family: coryphaenidae) were taken for the identification of this species. The body elongated and laterally compressed with a deeply forked caudal fin. The fins have no spines but contain the number of rays; dorsal-fin rays (57), pectoral fin rays (22), each ventral fin rays (5), anal fin rays (25) and vertebrae count (33). The body depth is less than 25% of its standard length (SL). This low value is attributed to the vent fullness. The head is blunt, the dorsal fin extends above the eye to the caudal fin forming about 86.9% of SL. Anal fin started slightly in front of the midpoint of the body (40.0% SL). Pectoral fins and ventral fin bases are situated on the same vertical line between them. Each pectoral fin length about 12.04% of its standard length (SL), that considered as one of the main distinguish characters of this species where each pectoral fin length about 1/2 head length. The tooth patch on the tongue is a rough spot of tooth-like structures present on the tongue, large and square in shape; dorsal and pectoral fins black while ventral, anal and caudal fins are white. The presence of black small dots scattered on head and the trunk of the body. © 2020, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of top predators can be crucial for evaluating key habitats, assessing the effects of anthropogenic activity and consequently applying suitable management policies. Here, we characterized dolphins acoustic occurrence and interactions with boat presence and noise in the waters of the Sicily Strait. A hydrophone was deployed on an elastic beacon three miles off the coast of south-west Sicily, and recorded continuously for 14 months, from January 2015. Results revealed that packed and train clicks types were the most detected signals, suggesting that animals were especially involved in feeding activity. A regular year-round acoustic presence was recorded, with seasonal variability. Two peaks were detected during the year in August and November, cuncurrently with a possible increase in fish biomass in the area. An abrupt decrease in click detection rate in September coincides with the biological shutdown in 2015 and the shift of fishing vessels offshore, suggesting a possible movement of dolphins following trawlers. Furthermore, dolphins vocalized more during the night-time, probably carrying out movements to and from the coast. Results indicated that dolphins interact with trawlers during mid-morning when an intermediate level of activity was collected, but click detection rate decreased with increasing noise levels at one-third octave bands centered at 250 Hz. Outcomes can help inform conservation efforts and the development of monitoring programmes focused on environmental impact assessments under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins are social cetaceans that strongly rely on acoustic communication and signaling. The diversity of sounds emitted by the species has been structurally classified into whistles, clicks and burst-pulsed sounds. Although click sounds and individually-specific signature whistles have been largely studied, not much is known about non-signature whistles. Most studies that link behavior and whistle production conduct aerial behavioral observations and link the production of whistles to the general category of social interactions. The aim of this study was to determine if there was a correlation between the non-signature whistle production and the underwater behaviors of a group of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, during their free time in the absence of trainers. To do this we made audio-video recordings 15 min before and after 10 training sessions of eight dolphins in Boudewijn Seapark (Belgium). For the behavioral analysis we conducted focal follows on each individual based on six behavioral categories. For the acoustical analysis, carried out at the group level, we used the SIGID method to identify non-signature whistles (N = 661) and we classified them in six categories according to their frequency modulation. The occurrences of the six categories of whistles were highly collinear. Most importantly, non-signature whistle production was positively correlated with the time individuals spent slow swimming alone, and was negatively correlated with the time spent in affiliative body contact. This is the first analysis that links the production of non-signature whistles with particular underwater behaviors in this species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Captive environments impact the microbiota of captive animals; however, the comparison of microbiota between wild and captive dolphins has been poorly investigated. To explore the impact of a captive environment, we characterized the fecal microbiota of nine wild and four captive Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, using a next-generation sequencing and revealed differences in the fecal microbiota between the analyzed groups. Statistical differences in abundances of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were found between the wild and captive dolphins. Thirty-six genera (22.9% of the total genera detected in all dolphins) were shared between the groups, whereas 79 (50.3%) and 42 (26.8%) genera were found only in the wild or captive dolphins, respectively. Several pathogenic bacterial genera, including Morganella and Mycoplasma, were detected only in the captive dolphins, and the genus Lactobacillus was found only in the wild dolphins. LefSe and SIMPER analyses revealed that the genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1 was significantly more abundant in the captive dolphins than in the wild ones and contributed the most to the dissimilarity of fecal microbiota between the groups. Our results indicate that the captive environment impacts the fecal microbiota of dolphins and reinforces the importance of monitoring potentially pathogenic bacteria in captivity. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment is a key component in improving the psychological and physiological well-being of animals under professional care. Environmental enrichment involves the addition of stimuli, including objects and cognitive challenges, into the environment in order to increase species-specific behaviour and provide opportunities for choice and control. The effectiveness of enrichment should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if the desired result has been achieved. Environmental enrichment devices (EEDs) can be utilised to present novel problems to animals under professional care. Here, a submerged interactive cognitive apparatus was presented to eight bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) five days a week for 18 weeks and behavioural indicators of animal welfare assessed. As a group, dolphins spent more time in social swims compared to solitary swims and more time at the bottom of the habitat than the middle or top throughout the day, even when the apparatus was not immediately available. Individuals' differences were apparent in the type and amount of engagement with the apparatus. Three dolphins engaged with the apparatus by solving it or consuming the reward. Two dolphins, D4 and D8, engaged simultaneously with the apparatus and participated in more social swimming with each other. D4 solved the interactive apparatus and engaged in more social active and solitary active behaviours. D1 and D4 increased their use of the bottom of the habitat. This study is the first report of underwater enrichment increasing dolphins time at depth throughout the day even when the enrichment device is not available. The interactive apparatus was an effective form of enrichment for dolphins participating in successful trials.  © 2020 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals are considered excellent ocean health sentinels and are ubiquitously exposed to chemical contaminants worldwide. The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) is a near-threatened dolphin species from Brazil with unknown population size data. This indicates the need for assessments regarding deleterious effects that may arise from exposure to chemical contamination, especially metals. After entry in the organism, these compounds are subject to internal subcellular compartmentalization, which in turn alters their bioavailability. However, almost no assessments regarding subcellular metal contents in marine mammals are available. In this context, metal compartmentalization was determined in three subcellular fractions for three toxic elements, Cd, Hg and Pb, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in Guiana dolphin kidney and liver samples from Southeastern Brazil. Differential metal-detoxification mechanisms were observed for the three elements, where metallothionein (MT) detoxification was postulated for only for Pb, while Cd and Hg were poorly associated to MT, and mostly present in the insoluble fraction, indicating low bioavailability. This is the first report on subcellular metal compartmentalization in Guiana dolphins and indicates that critical biochemical detoxification data is obtained through subcellular fraction analyses in marine mammals. This indicates an emerging study field for this type of assessment, which may, in turn, aid in conservation efforts. © Copyright © 2020 Hauser-Davis, Figueiredo, Lemos, de Moura, Rocha, Saint’Pierre, Ziolli and Siciliano.

ABSTRACT: Bycatch mortality from entanglement in fishing nets is a major threat to the conservation of endangered cetacean species, including South Asian river dolphins Platanista. Bycatch mortality of Platanista (estimated at around 5% of total population size per year) is often blamed on the use of illegal fishing gears (especially gillnets), and poor law enforcement. In our perspective paper, we found that over two-thirds of reported bycatch mortality of Platanista occurred in legal nets, from sources available on mesh sizes implicated in river dolphin bycatch. This finding highlights the need to critically revisit net mesh size regulations in existing fishery laws to effectively tackle the threat of bycatch. We show that minimum mesh size regulations have a colonial legacy and are a common element of fishery laws across three major range countries of Platanista: India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. We also show that the existing gaps between fishery laws and wildlife conservation laws are unlikely to be helpful in prevention of bycatch. Especially in the event of accidental bycatch mortality in legal nets, enforcement of wildlife laws protecting Platanista can get complicated. We discuss the consequences of Platanista bycatch in legal and illegal fishing nets for enforcement and fishers' compliance, and explore associated factors in small-scale capture fisheries that can constrain bycatch mitigation efforts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Quantifying the abundance of species is essential for their management and conservation. Much effort has been invested in surveys of freshwater dolphins in the Amazon basin but river dimensions and complex logistics limit replication of such studies across the region. We evaluated the effectiveness of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveying two Amazon dolphin species, the tucuxi Sotalia fluviatilis and pink river dolphin Inia geoffrensis, in tropical rivers. In 2016 we conducted drone and visual surveys over 80 km of the Juruá River in Brazil. The aerial surveys provided higher accuracy than human observers in counting individuals detected in groups. Compared to estimates derived from visual surveys, the use of UAVs could provide a more feasible, economical and accurate estimate of Amazon river dolphin populations. The method could potentially be replicated in other important areas for the conservation of these species, to generate an improved index of river dolphin populations in the Amazon.

ABSTRACT: Microplastics' (MPs) abundance, small size, and global distribution render them bioavailable to a variety of organisms directly or by trophic transfer, yet examinations in marine apex predators are currently limited. The present study investigated the occurrence of MPs sized 125 μm–5 mm in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) stranded in South Carolina, USA from 2017 to 2018. MPs, mostly fibers, were detected in all GITs (n = 7) of stranded bottlenose dolphins. Total suspected MPs ranged between 123 and 422 particles/individual, a high range among international studies. Comparison to other studies likely reflects differences in both methods and location. This is the first study from North America to quantify MPs in a small coastal cetacean outside Arctic waters and the first specifically in bottlenose dolphins (southeastern United States). Findings and methodology from this investigation can aid future studies examining MP in marine apex predators. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Worldwide, cetaceans are impacted by human activities, and those populations that occur in shallow-nearshore habitats are particularly vulnerable. We present the results of the first long-term study on the responses of a coastal population of endangered Irrawaddy dolphins to widespread habitat changes. We particularly investigated their responses in terms of distribution and abundance. Boat-based, line-transect surveys were conducted during 12 discrete survey periods in 7 survey years spanning a 15-year period (totaling 78 days and 4,630 km of effort) in Balikpapan Bay, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Irrawaddy dolphins were sighted on 136 occasions. Through DISTANCE analysis, a decrease in population density in the inner Bay area was observed from 0.45 dolphins/km2 in 2000–2001 (CV = 24%) to 0.34 and 0.32 dolphins/km2 in 2008 and 2015 (CV = 31% and 25%). A shift in distribution was noted between the periods 2000–2002 and 2008–2015 with significantly lower occurrence in the lower Bay segment compared to upper Bay segments. No sightings were made in the outer Bay area in later years, which coincided with increased shipping traffic in these areas. A peak in stranding events in 2016 and 2018 followed extremely high phenol levels within Bay waters in 2015 and a large-scale oil spill in 2018. The mean annual mortality rates of 0.67 Irrawaddy dolphins/year is unsustainable based on the lower potential biological removal (PBR) values for best abundance estimates of 2015 (Ndistance = 45 and Nmark–recapture = 73). Other threats to local dolphins include unsustainable fishing, underwater noise caused by construction, particularly piling activities. The research helped to identify Balikpapan Bay as an Important Marine Mammal Area by the IUCN MMPA Taskforce. Serious concerns remain for the concrete plans to move Indonesia’s capital city to the area north of the Bay, in terms of increased shipping traffic and harbor construction in the upper Bay segments that represent primary dolphin habitat. We recommend that protected areas be assigned for marine mammals and artisanal fisheries and shipping traffic and piling activities be excluded from these areas. We also recommend a legislated requirement of a mitigation protocol compulsory for piling and seismic activities within Indonesia. © Copyright © 2020 Kreb, Lhota, Porter, Redman, Susanti and Lazecky.

ABSTRACT: Few studies have explored the mating patterns of free-ranging cetaceans, largely because of logistical challenges. We used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to follow and video-record 25 groups of mating dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) near the surface of the water and examine how behavior patterns varied with mating group type. We collected aerial footage of dolphins mating in traditional Isolated Pods and within Integrated Pods and compared differences in the number of mating animals, swimming speed, bearing change, percent time at the surface of the water, female respiration rate, copulatory position rate, and sex-specific mating behaviors. Only the mean number of mating animals and some sex-specific mating behaviors varied significantly between the two mating group types. More dolphins were engaged in mating behaviors in Isolated Pods than Integrated Pods. Males engaged in more interference behaviors in Isolated Pods compared to Integrated Pods. Females performed fewer speed bursts but more rolls on their backs in Integrated Pods compared to Isolated Pods. Several similarities and differences were found in comparison to boat-based research of the same population of dolphins. We highlight the value of UAVs for noninvasive and accurate collection of cetacean behavioral data. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The study presents the first quantitative description of whistles (N = 1,017) recorded from free-range short-beaked common dolphins D.delphis ponticus, an endemic subspecies from the Black Sea. The dolphins produced high-pitched frequency-modulated whistles with the fundamental frequency of 1.6–33.2 kHz, the median values of minimum and maximum frequencies being 8.6 kHz and 16.0 kHz, respectively. Whistle duration varied from 0.16 to 2.94 s, with a median value of 1.04 s. Whistle contours with inflection points were the most common (74% of the whistles), followed by simpler whistles: downsweep (13%), upsweep (12%), and flat (1%). Stereotyped repeated frequency-modulated whistles registered in this and previous studies may serve as individual distinctive ‘signature whistles’ in common dolphins. Whistle parameters of the Black Sea subspecies correspond to those reported for D.delphis recorded in neighbouring regions: the Mediterranean Sea and Central–Eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Maximum whistle frequency in common dolphins exhibits a relationship with the body size, similarly to some other dolphin species. Together with minimum frequency, these are parameters with the least coefficients of variation; thus, they may be species-specific acoustic characteristics. This information can be used to distinguish between sympatric dolphin species during their passive acoustic monitoring. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin interactions with coastal fisheries are of major concern, reportedly leading to gear damage, which increases the cost of coastal fishing globally and in the Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this study was to determine the effect that gear, target species, mesh size, depth, soaking duration, fishing area, and season have on net depredation frequency and to offer insights on possible mitigation solutions. From November 2013 to February 2016 we monitored 107 active coastal fishers in 22 ports of the northern Aegean Sea coastline, identified the main target species of the fishery and recorded the damages on gill nets and trammel nets caused by dolphins, mainly the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Quasi-binomial generalized linear models were used to determine the relationship between the examined factors and depredation frequency. The analysis revealed that the gears mostly depredated were gill nets and trammel nets with small mesh sizes, mainly targeting surmullet (Mullus surmuletus), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), common sole (Solea solea), European hake (Merluccius merluccius), and caramote prawn (Melicertus kerathurus). The probability of depredation was also significantly dependent on the fishing area. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Off mainland Portugal, the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the most sighted cetacean, although information on this species is limited. The Atlantic coast of Southern Portugal is characterized by an intense wind-driven upwelling, creating ideal conditions for common dolphins. Using data collected aboard whale-watching boats (1929 sightings and 4548 h effort during 2010–2014), this study aims to understand the relationships between abundance rates (AR) of dolphins of different age classes (adults, juveniles, calves and newborns) and oceanographic [chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST)] variables. Over 70% of the groups contained immature animals. The AR of adults was negatively related with Chl-a, but not related to SST values. The AR of juveniles was positively related with SST. For calves and newborns, although the relationship between SST and AR is similar to that observed for juveniles, the effect could not be distinguished from zero. There was no relationship between Chl-a levels and the AR of juveniles, calves and newborns. These results corroborate previous findings that common dolphins tend to occur in highly productive areas demonstrating linkages between their abundance and oceanographic variables, and that this region may be a potential nursery ground. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Narrow dolphin mandibles with an elongate mandibular symphysis from the Oi Formation, Ichishi Group (late early Miocene) of Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, Japan is reported. The specimen shows different morphologies from "Eurhinodelphis"minoensis and Ninjadelphis ujiharai, which were reported from late early Miocene sediments of the same region. This new record expands our knowledge of lower Miocene odontocetes from Japan and indicates that at least three odontocetes are represented in the Mizunami and Ichishi Groups. © 2021 by the Palaeontological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: Previous reports suggested the existence of direct somatic motor control over heart rate (fH) responses during diving in some marine mammals, as the result of a cognitive and/or learning process rather than being a reflexive response. This would be beneficial for O2 storage management, but would also allow ventilation-perfusion matching for selective gas exchange, where O2 and CO2 can be exchanged with minimal exchange of N2. Such a mechanism explains how air breathing marine vertebrates avoid diving related gas bubble formation during repeated dives, and how stress could interrupt this mechanism and cause excessive N2 exchange. To investigate the conditioned response, we measured the fH-response before and during static breath-holds in three bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) when shown a visual symbol to perform either a long (LONG) or short (SHORT) breath-hold, or during a spontaneous breath-hold without a symbol (NS). The average fH (ifHstart), and the rate of change in fH (difH/dt) during the first 20 s of the breath-hold differed between breath-hold types. In addition, the minimum instantaneous fH (ifHmin), and the average instantaneous fH during the last 10 s (ifHend) also differed between breath-hold types. The difH/dt was greater, and the ifHstart, ifHmin, and ifHend were lower during a LONG as compared with either a SHORT, or an NS breath-hold (P < 0.05). Even though the NS breath-hold dives were longer in duration as compared with SHORT breath-hold dives, the difH/dt was greater and the ifHstart, ifHmin, and ifHend were lower during the latter (P < 0.05). In addition, when the dolphin determined the breath-hold duration (NS), the fH was more variable within and between individuals and trials, suggesting a conditioned capacity to adjust the fH-response. These results suggest that dolphins have the capacity to selectively alter the fH-response during diving and provide evidence for significant cardiovascular plasticity in dolphins. © Copyright © 2020 Fahlman, Cozzi, Manley, Jabas, Malik, Blawas and Janik.

ABSTRACT: Sympatric species are expected to differ in ecological requirements to minimize niche overlap and avoid competition. Here we assess the trophic interactions among three coexisting dolphin species from southern Brazil: the franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), and the Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus). We evaluated temporal variation in carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope values of bone collagen to examine potential dietary shifts resulting from increased fishing activity over the past three decades. We estimated the degree of niche overlap among these species and the contribution of potential prey sources to their diet. δ15N values were consistent among species and across years, while δ13C values increased for Guiana dolphins and decreased for bottlenose dolphins, suggesting changes in diet and/or foraging habitats through time. The similar δ13C and δ15N values and the high niche overlap between Guiana and bottlenose dolphins indicate that these species are primarily feeding on demersal prey. The franciscana diet is primarily composed of pelagic prey, resulting in a lower niche overlap in comparison with the other dolphin species. Our study provides further information about the foraging ecology of this unique dolphin community in southern Brazil with implications for its management and conservation. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Riverine habitats are degrading at an alarming rate due to anthropogenic interventions. Construction of large dams and barrages on the Ganga River has severely fragmented the riverine habitat of dolphins. This study examines the impact of structural barriers on the habitat of the Ganga River dolphin (Platanista gangetica) in a reach between Bijnor and Narora barrage in the middle Ganga and at the Farakka barrage in the lower Ganga Plain. We use time-series remote sensing images and flow discharge data to assess the morphological and ecological impact in the proximity of these barrages. Our result suggests that after the construction of Bijnor barrage in 1985, the total bar area of the Ganga River has reduced from 150 to 45 km2, but the channel width has remained unchanged during the period between 1980 and 2010. A time-series analysis of the discharge shows a slightly declining trend after the year 1982. However, this observed trend is not adequate to explain the habitat degradation of the Ganga River dolphins. Further width of the Ganga River in the downstream of the Farakka barrage has reduced from 4 to 1 km, and the total bar area has increased from about 5 to 35 km2 during the period between 1965 and 1980. Also during this period, the pre-monsoon discharge of the Ganga River has reduced by one-third in the downstream of Farakka barrage. This study concludes that the loss of dolphins in the downstream reaches of the Farakka barrage could be associated with the change in hydraulic geometry, flow characteristics, and loss of longitudinal and lateral connectivity. Conversely, the impoundments of water upstream of the Narora barrage have maintained the suitable habitat conditions for the dolphins to thrive. This has resulted in a reported growth in the dolphin population during the years 1993–2010. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The evaluation of symbiotic microbial communities occurring in the intestinal tract of animals has received great interest in recent years. However, little is known about gut microbial communities in cetaceans, despite their relevance in the ecology of marine communities. Here, we report an investigation using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the resident gut microbiota of the two cetacean species Stenella coeruleoalba and Tursiops truncatus by sampling intestinal mucosa from specimens retrieved stranded along the Tyrrhenian coast of Tuscany (Italy). We found an abundance of members from Clostridiaceae and Fusobacteriaceae, which in total accounted for more than 50% of reads, in agreement with gut microbiota composition of other carnivorous mammals. Probably due to the limited number of samples available, sex, preservation status and also species, did not correlate with overall differences in the microbiota. Indeed, a high similarity of the taxonomic (family-level) composition between the gut microbiota of the two species was found. However, Pedobacter spp. was found abundant in amplicon sequencing libraries from S. coeruleoalba, while clostridia were more abundant from T. truncatus samples. Our results shed some light on the gut microbiota composition of two dolphin (S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus) species, with specimens collected in the wild. Studies with a larger number of individuals are now needed to confirm these first results and evaluate the interspecific differences in relation to sex and age.

ABSTRACT: This study used models to assess how the type of prey caught by artisanal fishermen influenced the occurrence of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) in the region of the estuarine lagunar comple.x of Cananéia (São Paulo, Brazil). The data were collected from January 2012 to November 2014, during three fieldwork expeditions per season (spring, summer, autumn, winter). Mullets (Mugil liza) were the fish with the highest association to dolphins, followed by Oligoplites spp. and Lobotes spp.; Mugil curema and shrimp, on the other hand, negatively influenced their distribution. The presence of fish-weir fisheries in the estuary also had a positive influence on the occurrence of dolphins, since this fishing gear is used as a barrier, minimizing the potential for their prey to escape. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Ganges river dolphin, Platanista gangetica gangetica is one of the endangered cetaceans. Due to increasing anthropogenic activities, it has faced a significant reduction in distribution range since the late 1800s and has even gone extinct from most of the early localities. The investigation of complete mitogenome holds significant relevance for identifying evolutionary relationships and monitoring the endangered species. Herein, we report and characterize for the first time the 16,319 bp complete mitochondrial genome of P. g. gangetica. It comprises 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and one control region (CR). The genome composition was A + T biased (59.6%) and exhibited a positive AT-skew (0.104) and negative GC-skew (− 0.384). All the genes were encoded on the heavy strand, except eight tRNAs and the ND6 gene. In the CR, an 18 bp tandem repeat sequence was observed. Our Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic analysis indicated that studied river dolphins were polyphyletic and the placement of Platanista was to be more basal than other river dolphins (Lipotes, Inia and Pontoporia). The pairwise genetic distance of Platanista with other cetaceans was varied, with an overall close affinity with whales. The model-based BI and ML phylogenetic analysis indicated that Platanista clustering with Ziphiidae with high to moderate supportive values (PP/BP = 98/68). The results of this study provide insights important for the conservation genetics and further evolutionary studies of the freshwater river dolphins. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: For underwater acoustic covert communications, biomimetic covert communications have been developed using dolphin whistles. The conventional biomimetic covert communication methods transmit slightly different signal patterns from real dolphin whistles, which results in a low degree of mimic (DoM). In this paper, we propose a novel biomimetic communication method that preserves the large DoM with a low bit error rate (BER). For the transmission, the proposed method utilizes the various contours of real dolphin whistles with the link information among consecutive whistles, and the proposed receiver uses machine learning based whistle detectors with the aid of the link information. Computer simulations and practical ocean experiments were executed to demonstrate the better BER performance of the proposed method. Ocean experiments demonstrate that the BER of the proposed method was 0.002, while the BER of the conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) based detector showed 0.36. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Protecting critical habitats of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, is a hot topic of discussion for marine biodiversity conservation in China and many Southeast Asian countries. In practice, sound habitat protection action (HPA) planning often suffers from information gaps in macroscopic habitat configurations and changes in the habitat conditions of humpback dolphins. Recent publications in the journal Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems (AQC) have served to advance humpback dolphin conservation in Chinese waters by resolving such habitat configurations and indicating significant changes in distribution patterns and habitat characteristics under intense coastal anthropogenic activity. We highlight an integrative research framework to investigate habitat configuration and long-term habitat changes when planning a holistic HPA programme for humpback dolphins. When constructing habitat configuration baselines, field surveys should be designed and conducted in a systematic manner to ensure survey efforts cover diverse environments equally, in either a spatially stratified or gridded pattern, to minimize potential spatial sampling biases. Long-term habitat changes can be revealed by comparing satellite images from different decades. Changes in habitat preferences and habitat characteristics can be explored through questionnaire surveys on local ecological knowledge, associating historical occurrences with coastline features and projecting historical habitat configuration by species distribution modelling exercises. A lack of good communication and sharing of information between research and management sectors can still be an obstacle to the implementation of sound conservation practices, however, even though there is robust scientific evidence to fill knowledge gaps in distribution and habitat baselines. We have addressed the need to establish a mechanism to improve and streamline information sharing between research teams, management sectors, and stakeholder groups. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Two subspecies of bottlenose dolphins are observed, not simultaneously, in a narrow coastal area of the western South Atlantic Ocean. However, their trophic interaction is unknown. Such information can be explored using stable isotope composition in teeth, warranting time series data. We analyzed carbon and nitrogen isotopic values (δ13C and δ15N) of dentin growth layer groups in teeth of Tursiops truncatus truncatus and Tursiops truncatus gephyreus stranded along this area of potential co-occurrence in order to investigate the trophic, spatial and temporal dimensions of their isotopic niches. For each subspecies, we calculated isotopic niche width and the possible overlap in resource use between them. We modeled δ13C and δ15N according to age to verify ontogenetic variations in resources use. We also measured the ratio of individual variation by that of the population to estimate the degree of individual specialization within each subspecies. Mean isotopic values differed only for carbon values (δ13CTtg = − 12.7‰; δ13CTtt = − 14.3‰), and a small overlap in resource use between subspecies was observed. Individual specialization was evident in both subspecies suggesting temporal consistency in resource use and indicating they forage upon various preys. Although weaning age and feeding habit seem similar, subspecies diverge especially in habitat use, indicating they adapted for feeding in different environments. These results show a clear habitat partitioning between subspecies and only a small overlap on resource use within the area, reinforcing the hypothesis of a parapatric distribution with very occasional contacts in this region of the western South Atlantic Ocean. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive parameters of 168 franciscana dolphins, Pontoporia blainvillei (73 females and 95 males) incidentally caught (n = 163) or stranded (n = 5) between 2005 and 2016 in southeastern Brazil are presented. Ovarian macroscopic analysis revealed 55 immature (75.3%) and 18 mature (24.7%) females. Annual pregnancy rate was estimated to be 0.36, with a calving interval of 2.8 years. Testicular histology revealed 66 immature (69.5%) and 29 mature (30.5%) males. Males with combined testis weight above 4 g were mature, and 1-year-old mature males and a 2-year-old pregnant female are reported for the first time for the species. Reproductive seasonality does not seem to occur in the study area. Mean age and length at sexual maturation were estimated to be at 2.7 years and 128.5 cm for females, and 2.7 years and 114.0 cm for males. These estimates are lower than most of the estimates for this species. These results add novel and valuable information on the reproductive patterns of this endangered species, threatened by high levels of mortality in gillnet fisheries. The information presented here represents an important effort to obtain more reliable parameter estimates for the studied area, needed for a better assessment of its current conservation status. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: In cetaceans, increased body flexibility is associated with increased maneuverability, this affects the animal’s swimming speed and foraging behavior. A more stable body form is associated with fast swimming and wide turns. One factor that affects the flexibility of a cetacean’s body is the structure and interaction of its vertebrae. Differences in vertebral morphology confer different muscular insertion sites and affect mechanical properties of swimming muscles. We studied vertebral morphology in four closely related and partially sympatric dolphin species from the Southern Hemisphere: Commerson’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), Peale’s dolphin (Lagenorhynchus australis), the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) and the hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger). The former two species are usually considered coastal, associated with complex habitats where foraging strategies require greater maneuverability; they also show plasticity in their prey preferences. The latter two species are considered fast-swimming cooperative feeders, with long distance movements reflecting prey availability in pelagic habitats. We employed three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric techniques and multivariate analyses to evaluate differences in vertebral morphology. Our analyses tested whether particular morphologies that limit or enhance flexibility were associated with preferred habitats and feeding strategies. We established links between morphology and behavioral patterns based on the biomechanical significance of specific vertebral morphological features. Principal component analyses (PCA) showed great differentiation between species in all the studied regions along the vertebral column. This was especially evident in the middle area, except in the case of dusky and hourglass dolphins which showed no discernible morphological difference in their mid-column vertebrae. PCA results were supported by statistically significant Mahalanobis distances (MD) between species. Species associated with complex habitats and behaviors possessed morphological features associated with greater flexibility of the column (i.e., spool-shaped vertebrae with short erect processes), whereas cooperative-feeder species possessed features associated with greater stability (i.e., disk-shaped vertebrae with long strongly bent processes). In these closely related and partially sympatric dolphins, vertebral morphology is distinctive and varies with the differential foraging strategies and habitat of each species. These findings reveal morphological plasticity among these dolphin species, highlighting the importance of behavioral complexity and of habitat use in the evolutionary development of morphological adaptations. © Copyright © 2020 Marchesi, Mora, Dans, Coscarella and González-José.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains of Morganella morganii is increasingly being recognized. Recently, we reported a fatal M. morganii infection in a captive bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) bred at a dolphinarium in South Korea. According to our subsequent investigations, the isolated M. morganii strain KC-Tt-01 exhibited extensive resistance to third-generation cephalosporins which have not been reported in animals. Therefore, in the present study, the genome of strain KC-Tt-01 was sequenced, and putative virulence and AMR genes were investigated. The strain had virulence and AMR genes similar to those of other M. morganii strains, including a strain that causes human sepsis. An amino-acid substitution detected at the 86th residue (Arg to Cys) of the protein encoded by ampR might explain the extended resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. These results indicate that the AMR M. morganii strain isolated from the captive dolphin has the potential to cause fatal zoonotic infections with antibiotic treatment failure due to extended drug resistance, and therefore, the management of antibiotic use and monitoring of the emergence of AMR bacteria are urgently needed in captive cetaceans for their health and conservation. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In Hawaiian waters fishermen use the association between pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) to catch tuna. Targeting fishing effort around or in spotted dolphin groups has the potential to lead to bycatch, and anecdotal reports of hooking dolphins exist. We recorded information on fishing vessels associated with spotted dolphin groups from 2008 through 2018 to inform discussions about potential bycatch. Associations occurred from Oʻahu to Hawaiʻi Island, but were most prevalent off Hawaiʻi Island, where 29.7 % of spotted dolphin groups had fishing vessels present. When fishing vessels were present, trolling through the dolphin group envelope was recorded in 91.7 % of encounters, and re-positioning through the dolphin group and dropping hook and line fishing gear at the leading edge of the group was recorded in 54.2 % of encounters (most of which also had vessels trolling through). Associations occurred over all four oceanographic seasons, with no obvious seasonal trend. Off Hawaiʻi Island, fishing vessels with spotted dolphin groups were concentrated in a narrower depth range than dolphin groups without fishing vessels present. Groups with fishing vessels were also concentrated in a smaller geographic area that corresponded to proximity to harbors and boat launches. The number of fishing vessels that associated with spotted dolphin groups off Hawaiʻi Island was estimated in the low hundreds (159, (SD = 12) for 2012; 330 (SD = 17) for 2013). Overall, our results suggest that fishing vessel associations with pantropical spotted dolphins in Hawaiian waters are widespread, occur frequently, and involve many participants, suggesting the risk of accidental hooking may be greater than perceived. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The “active” cochlear mechanism of hearing manifests in the cochlear compression. Investigations of compression in odontocetes help to determine the frequency limit of the active mechanism. The compression may be evaluated by comparison of low- and on-frequency masking. In a bottlenose dolphin, forward masking of auditory evoked potentials to tonal pips was investigated. Measurements were performed for test frequencies of 45 and 90 kHz. The low-frequency maskers were − 0.25 to − 0.75 oct relative the test. Masking efficiency was varied by masker-to-test delay variation from 2 to 20 ms, and masker levels at threshold (MLTs) were evaluated at each of the delays. It was assumed that low-frequency maskers were not subjected or little subjected to compression whereas on-frequency maskers were subjected equally to the test. Therefore, the compression rate was assessed as the slope of low-frequency MLT dependence on on-frequency MLT. For the 90-kHz test, the slopes were 0.63 and 0.18 dB/dB for masker of − 0.25 and − 0.5 oct, respectively. For the 45 kHz test, the slopes were 0.69 and 0.39 dB/dB for maskers of − 0.25 and − 0.5 oct. So, compression did not decay at the upper boundary of the hearing frequency range in the dolphin. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Standardized sightings of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) from the south and west coasts of Puerto Rico were quantitatively analyzed to determine the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of sighting location, group size, composition and behavior in relation to key features such as distance from shore, depth and habitat type. Dolphin inhabit primarily the nearshore zone within 5 km of the coast, but they are also associated with edge and slope habitats of the platform and bank/islands off the west coast. Dolphins were rare both over the central portion of the western platform, characterized as a broad area of sand, as well as in deep waters outside the shelf edge zone. Although dolphins were sighted in various habitat types, the most predominant were sea grass beds (44%), sand (25%), and reef (22%). Only 17% of the sightings were in deeper waters, such as the shelf edge and mid platform, which were dominated by hard bottom. Multiple, multivariate correlations based on distance (DISTLM) showed that the only statistically significant predictor for dolphin relative abundances was Habitat Evenness (AIC = 250.89; R2 = 0.12; p = 0.003). On the other hand, for behavior data, DistLM showed that the only significant predictor was average rugosity (AICc = 551.21, R2 = 0.09, p = 0.02), where social behavior was more common in high rugosity areas, while traveling predominated in low rugosity areas. Given the predominately inshore distribution of bottlenose dolphins, their low abundance, and multiyear residency we believe the area off the west coast of Puerto Rico should be designated as a Critical Habitat. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Morphological characteristics of bones have shaped as a result of adaptation to life in the aquatic environment and whale diving habits. This study deals with the postnatal bone development and microscopic characteristics of bones of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Bone sections of the right humerus and the fifth right rib of 106 dolphins aged less than 1–21 years were used to determine the density of the primary, secondary and remodelling osteons, the magnitude of the area occupied by the osteons, and the number of osteon lamellae. Bone sections were analysed using a compound microscope with standard and polarized light. Our study showed the primary osteons of bones to occupy a smaller area than the secondary ones. The secondary osteon area in the humerus is significantly larger than that in the rib. All rib osteons are significantly denser than those of the humerus. In both bones, the number of osteon lamellae is higher in secondary than in primary osteons. The number of secondary and remodelling osteons and the areas occupied by them increase with age, as opposed to primary osteons in which a decrease was noted. The number of lamellae in primary osteons decreases with age, while in secondary osteons their number increases. Within the study frame, morphometric osteon values of the bottlenose dolphin were determined, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time ever as concerns the aquatic mammals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Two ecotypes of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) occur in New Zealand waters: a widely studied Nationally Endangered coastal ecotype and a little-known oceanic ecotype. Site fidelity and association patterns of the oceanic ecotype, and home range overlap with the coastal ecotype, are examined from photo-identification records collected off northeastern New Zealand between 2005 and 2016. The oceanic ecotype occurs widely in the study area: distance from shore ranged from <1 to ~150 km and home ranges of the two ecotypes overlap in some areas. Forty-nine percent of the 478 identified distinctive or very distinctive individuals were sighted during more than 1 year and resightings spanned over 10 years and 650 km. All individuals were linked by association in a single, albeit clustered, social network. Unlike the coastal ecotype, interspecific associations with false killer (Pseudorca crassidens) and southern long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas edwardii) were frequent, occurring during 84% of encounters. Only one oceanic individual matched any of the individuals from the coastal ecotype photo-identification catalogues throughout the study area, suggesting that the two ecotypes co-occur parapatrically. We recommend that the two ecotypes be considered independent management units for conservation purposes due to their divergent ecologies. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Pantropical spotted dolphins are apex predators and have a long lifespan, which makes them susceptible to chemical pollutants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are associated with immunotoxicity in wildlife. However, the effects of PBDEs and their mechanism of immunotoxicity in dolphins is largely unknown. Previously, we established fibroblast cell lines obtained from pantropical spotted dolphins (PSD-LWHT) as an in vitro model for assessing the toxicological implications of chemical pollutants in dolphins. In this study, we used the novel immortalized fibroblast cell line to explore the potential immune stimulation effect of PBDEs via prostaglandins signaling pathways to better understand the immunotoxicity pathway of PBDEs in dolphins. BDE-47, -100, and −209 exposure generally resulted in an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression, PGE2 levels, and COX-2 gene expression but BDE-209 resulted in a suppression in IL-10 production. Both protein and mRNA expression of COX-2 and PTGES increased significantly following exposure to the PBDEs. The results suggested BDE-100 and -209 increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production via increased expression of COX-2 and PTGES expression. Only BDE-100 increased expression level of the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 while BDE-47 and BDE-209 decreased its expression. This probably explained why suppressive effect on the expression level of anti-inflammatory cytokines were only found in exposure with BDE-47 and BDE-209 rather than BDE-100. The results showed that PBDEs stimulate innate immune response by triggering PGE2-EPs-cAMP-cytokines signaling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have a worldwide distribution in temperate and tropical waters and often inhabit estuarine environments, indicating their ability to maintain homeostasis in low salinity for limited periods of time. Epidermal and biochemical changes associated with low salinity exposure have been documented in stranded bottlenose dolphins; however, these animals are often found severely debilitated or deceased and in poor condition. Dolphins in the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program travel globally, navigating varied environments comparable to those in which free-ranging dolphins are observed. A retrospective analysis was performed of medical records from 46 Navy dolphins and blood samples from 43 Navy dolphins exposed to a variety of salinity levels for different durations over 43 years (from 1967–2010). Blood values from samples collected during low salinity environmental exposure (salinity ranging from 0–30 parts per thousand (ppt) were compared to samples collected while those same animals were in a seawater environment (31–35 ppt). Epidermal changes associated with low salinity exposure were also assessed. Significant decreases in serum sodium, chloride, and calculated serum osmolality and significant increases in blood urea nitrogen and aldosterone were observed in blood samples collected during low salinity exposure. Epidermal changes were observed in 35% of the animals that spent time in low salinity waters. The prevalence of epidermal changes was inversely proportional to the level of salinity to which the animals were exposed. Future work is necessary to fully comprehend the impacts of low salinity exposure in bottlenose dolphins, but the physiological changes observed in this study will help improve our understanding of the upper limit of duration and the lower limit of salinity in which a bottlenose dolphin can maintain homeostasis. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes changes to protected areas for Maui dolphin implemented in 2012 and 2013 and estimates their effectiveness in reducing bycatch. An Expert Panel of New Zealand and international scientists, convened by the New Zealand government in 2012, estimated that five Maui dolphins were killed in fishing gear each year - one in trawl fisheries and four in gillnet fisheries. The estimated number of trawl mortalities is unchanged, as no additional protection from trawling has been implemented. The number of gillnet mortalities per year is estimated to have decreased to at best two per year. © 2020 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins were first formally considered as a 'pest' species in the Mediterranean Sea in the late 19th century as they frequently disrupted fishing activities. Numerous fishing organisations/syndicates requested permission to hunt dolphins and the killing of dolphins was allowed by a number of national laws. This paper provides an overview of the hunting of dolphins in Italy across 14 Italian Maritime Compartments, mainly from 1927-1937. It summarises governmental measures implemented, numbers of individuals killed and their monetary value in accordance with the bounty system; official records reveal over 7,200 dolphins (species not specified) killed during the 11-year period and approximately 400,000 Italian Liras (~- 355,000 EUR in today's money) was paid out. In addition to the bounty, the meat was either consumed or sold, making dolphin hunting a profitable activity. The lack of information on species identity and the size of dolphin populations around the Italian coast at that time make it difficult to estimate the population level impact of 'bounty fishing', but it is possible that it had a significant impact. © 2020 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) population along the eastern Adriatic coast is believed to comprise discrete communities, yet many of them are unstudied. This study provides the first description of occurrence and demographic parameters for the community inhabiting waters of North Dalmatia. Dedicated boat-based surveys conducted in summer months from 2013 to 2017 resulted in 13,896 km of research effort and 284 dolphin sightings from which 336 individuals were identified. Site-fidelity analysis revealed that 52.1% of encountered marked adults occur in the area regularly or occasionally. No significant difference among years could be found for mean group sizes (5.73–7.46) and group encounter rates (1.159–1.942 groups/100 km). Pollock's Robust Design models estimated annually variable adult apparent survival (0.737–0.986) and constant temporary emigration rate of 0.172. The estimated abundance varied annually from 116 to 138 individuals and showed a negative slope, but a significant trend could not be confirmed. Age-dependent models estimated first-year calf survival at 0.875. These results provide a baseline for informed management of two Sites of Community Importance, and a benchmark for future monitoring in North Dalmatian waters, an area under significant anthropogenic pressure. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Cetacean physical maturity is defined by growth cessation and complete fusion of epiphyses to vertebral bodies indicated by invisible sutures. Many studies have shown epiphyseal fusion is highly variable among individuals. In-depth examinations into fusion variability are lacking. We analyzed vertebrae of 37 (n = 21 female, n = 16 male) stranded common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the well-studied Gulf of Mexico, Sarasota Bay community. For each specimen, vertebrae were examined by vertebral region for degree of fusion anteriorly and posteriorly of each centrum and categorized from unfused to fused in five degrees. An ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate degree of fusion probability for each epiphysis. The model had fixed effects for age, number of offspring, sex, sexual maturity, and a random effect for epiphysis. Results show that age/reproductive status significantly explains an individual's degree of fusion. Adult females with fewer calves had more fusion than those with more reproductive experience across multiple ages. Access to long-term observational and sample data on the dolphins residing in the area served by Mote Marine Laboratory's Stranding Investigations Program offers a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between energetic demands of reproduction (calcium production/reproductive output) versus preconceived definitions of physical maturity (skeletal fusion) more closely. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Acute-phase proteins (APP) are the foundation to the innate immune response and valuable biomarkers that increase with inflammation, infection, neoplasia, stress, and trauma.2,4,16 Little is known about the acute-phase response in cetaceans and if these proteins can be used for health monitoring in individuals and free-ranging populations. The purpose of this study was to characterize serum concentrations of haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA), as well as electrophoretic profiles of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in free-ranging (n = 33) and professional care (n = 27) settings. Results were correlated to commonly utilized inflammatory indices including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, total white blood cell count (WBC), and absolute neutrophil count. SAA levels, measured with a dolphin-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were significantly higher (P = 0.05) in free-ranging dolphins (mean = 4.26; SE = 1.12) when compared with those under professional care (mean = 1.82; SE = 0.45). For dolphins under professional care, a statistically significant correlation was identified between ESR and Hp (P < 0.001; r = 0.69), ESR and SAA (P < 0.001; r = 0.67), fibrinogen and Hp (P = 0.001; r = 0.58), and fibrinogen and SAA (P = 0.002; r = 0.56). In addition, there was a significant correlation between WBC and SAA (P = 0.01; r = 0.38) and absolute neutrophil count and SAA (P = 0.04; r = 0.32). There were no significant correlations between study variables observed in free-ranging dolphins. The variable correlation of APPs with commonly utilized inflammatory indices demonstrates that these proteins are independent measures of inflammation with unique sensitivity, specificity, and timeline of expression. The results of this study contribute to improved health monitoring of dolphins and have the potential to assist in identification of compromised health. © Copyright 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a ubiquitous bacterium that causes the foodborne illness, listeriosis. Clonal complexes (CC), such as CC121, are overrepresented in the food production industry, and are rarely reported in animals and the environment. Working within a European-wide project, we investigated the routes by which strains are transmitted from environments and animals to food and the food production environment (FPE). In this context, we report, for the first time, the occurrence of a ST121 (CC121) strain isolated from a dolphin brain. The genome was compared with the genomes of 376 CC121 strains. Genomic comparisons showed that 16 strains isolated from food were the closest to the dolphin strain. Like most of the food strains analyzed here, the dolphin strain included genomic features (transposon Tn6188, plasmid pLM6179), both described as being associated with the strain’s adaptation to the FPE. Like all 376 strains, the dolphin strain contained a truncated actA gene and inlA gene, both described as being associated with attenuated virulence. Despite this fact, the strain was able to cross blood-brain barrier in immunosuppressed dolphin exposed polychlorinated biphenyl and invaded by parasites. Our data suggest that the dolphin was infected by a food-related strain released into the Mediterranean Sea. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: More than 9 years since the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident (FDNPPA), the impact of FDNPPA on marine biota is being revealed. In this work, the evolution of FDNPPA derived 134Cs, 137Cs and 110mAg in dolphin fishes (Coryphaena hippurus) in the Northwest Pacific from Dec. 2011 to Sept. 2018 were studied. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) of radiocesium (29–69 with the average of 48) in dolphin fishes were calculated. The background level of 137Cs in dolphin fishes (<0.14 Bq/kgfresh weight) before FDNPPA was estimated. The radioactive levels of these three radionuclides in dolphin fishes decreased with time. Among them, 134Cs and 110mAg decreased at the half-lives of 158 days and 54 days at the population level, respectively. After May 2014, 134Cs and 110mAg cannot be detected and the activity of 137Cs returned to the background level before FDNPPA. Radiation dose assessment demonstrated that it was far from causing radiation harm to dolphin fishes in the open ocean of Northwest Pacific and humans who ingested them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Species distribution models (SDMs) often rely on abiotic variables as proxies for biotic relationships. This means that important biotic relationships may be missed, creating ambiguity in our understanding of the drivers of habitat use. These problems are especially relevant for populations of predators, as their habitat use is likely to be strongly influenced by the distribution of their prey. We investigated habitat use of a population of a top predator, bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, using generalised additive models, and compared the results of models with and without biotic predictor variables.We found that al though habitat use by bottlenose dolphins was significantly correlated with abiotic variables that likely describe foraging areas, introduction of biotic variables describing potential prey almost doubled the deviance ex-plained, from 19.8 to 39.1%. Biotic variables were the most important of the predictors used, and indicated that the dolphins showed a preference for areas with a high abundance of a reef fish, girdled wrasse Notolabrus cinctus. For the dolphins of Doubtful Sound, these results show the importance of prey distribution in driving habitat use. On a broader scale, our results indicate that making an effort to include true biotic descriptors in SDMs can improve model performance, resulting in better understanding of the drivers of distribution of marine predators. © Inter-Research 2020.

ABSTRACT: Based on the special streamline profile of the Phocoenoides dalli head, this paper innovatively proposes to transform the NACA 0018 airfoil into a novel airfoil whose leading edge is similar to the streamline profile of the Phocoenoides dalli head, and makes corresponding minor adjustments to this new airfoil according to the dolphin's motion behavior, and eventually obtains three kinds of dolphin head-shaped new airfoils including the Original Dolphin Airfoil, the Smooth Transition Dolphin Airfoil and the Deflected Dolphin Airfoil. Due to different deflection angles, the Deflected Dolphin Airfoil is then subdivided into five different types. The aerodynamic performances of these three dolphin head-shaped new airfoils as well as the NACA 0018 airfoil are simulated by using the SST k-ω model at Re = 1.6 × 105. The results show that: Compared with the NACA 0018 airfoil, firstly, the aerodynamic performances of three kinds of dolphin head-shaped airfoils are quite different from each other because of the change of the curvature and the radius of the leading edge. Secondly, by comparing the lift and drag coefficients of the Deflected Dolphin Airfoils with five deflection angles, it is speculated that there is an optimal deflection angle for the Deflected Dolphin Airfoil under the conditions of this paper. Eventually, the deflection angle of 24° is found to be the optimal value among these five different deflection angles. The results of this study can provide reference for improving the performance of blade design, such as the rotating mechanical blades, the aeronautical blades, etc. © 2020

ABSTRACT: Indicators for preserving marine biodiversity include knowledge of how the spatial distribution and critical habitats of species overlap with human activities and impacts. Such indicators are key tools for marine spatial planning, a process that identifies and resolves conflicts between human uses and the conservation of marine environments. The common bottlenose dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List and a priority species of the EU Habitat Directive. Here, we estimated spatio-temporal patterns of the species occurrence in the area around one Marine Protected Area (MPA) and two Sites of Community Importance (SCI) of the North western Sardinia, with the aim to predict the species distribution and the main links with the environmental factors and boat traffic. To evaluate whether dolphin groups with calves showed any habitat preference different from groups without calves, separate models for both type of groups were done. The most important contributing variables to the dolphin habitat suitability models were the likelihood of boat presence, habitat type and mean sea surface temperature. Different model outputs were obtained depending on dolphin group composition. The area of high likelihood of dolphin presence ranged between 30 and 60 km2 and was smaller for groups with calves. Further, the area of highest dolphin habitat suitability overlaps with the area of high boat traffic, suggesting that boating in the study site is a potential relevant anthropogenic threat to dolphins. Particularly, boating is concentrated inside and around the MPA/SCIs, indicating the need for stronger restriction measures. We propose updated SCI boundaries for effective protection of common bottlenose dolphins. These areas and the suggestions of regulation are specifically aimed at reducing the impact of boating on dolphins, especially for groups with calves. Synthesis and applications. Management measures should be designed based on the data here provided, and then implemented and enforced to decrease dolphin-boat interactions, especially for mother-calf pairs. The creation of new coastal SCIs should be considered especially where boat traffic overlaps with areas most suitable for dolphins. In these SCIs, boating should be managed to limit disturbance, avoidance or alterations of dolphin vital behavior. © Copyright © 2020 La Manna, Ronchetti, Sarà, Ruiu and Ceccherelli.

ABSTRACT: Long-term monitoring of cetacean vocalizations allows for the exploration of their occurrence, seasonality and abundance. However, accurate automatic detection of vocalizations from vast acoustic datasets containing diverse sound sources remains a challenge. In this study, we propose the permutation entropy (H) and the sample entropy (SE) as metrics for the unattended detection of whistles and clicks. We tested the detection performance of whistles and clicks in various scenarios commonly occurring in marine habitats, including dense snapping shrimps, vessel engine noise and overlapping whistles and clicks. The use of the entropy metrics resulted in detection accuracy of over 95%. In particular, H outcomes correctly detected whistles even if associated with snapping shrimps or engine noise, while SE was a reliable indicator for clicks and robust to vessel noise. These algorithms do not require prior training in vocalization and are computationally fast. The advancement of metrics such as those presented here, will enable non-invasive and cost-effective assessment of cetacean population dynamics and health and may inform future conservation management. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Cardiac auscultation is an important, albeit underutilized tool in aquatic animal medicine due to the many challenges associated with in-water examinations. The aims of this prospective study were to (1) establish an efficient and repeatable in-water cardiac auscultation technique in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), (2) describe the presence and characterization of heart murmurs detected in free-ranging and managed dolphins, and (3) characterize heart murmur etiology through echocardiography in free-ranging dolphins. For technique development, 65 dolphins cared for by the Navy Marine Mammal Program (Navy) were auscultated. The techniques were then applied to two free-ranging dolphin populations during capture-release health assessments: Sarasota Bay, Florida (SB), a reference population, and Barataria Bay, LA (BB), a well-studied population of dolphins impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Systolic heart murmurs were detected at a frequent and similar prevalence in all dolphin populations examined (Navy 92%, SB 89%, and BB 88%), and characterized as fixed or dynamic. In all three populations, sternal cranial and left cranial were the most common locations for murmur point of maximal intensity (PMI). An in-water transthoracic echocardiogram technique was refined on a subset of Navy dolphins, and full echocardiographic exams were performed on 17 SB dolphins and 29 BB dolphins, of which, 40 had murmurs. Spectral Doppler was used to measure flow velocities across the outflow tracts, and almost all dolphins with audible murmurs had peak outflow velocities ≥1.6 m/s (95%, 38/40); three dolphins also had medium mitral regurgitation which could be the source of their murmurs. The presence of audible murmurs in most of the free-ranging dolphins (88%) was attributed to high velocity blood flow as seen on echocardiography, similar to a phenomenon described in other athletic species. These innocent murmurs were generally characterized as Grade I-III systolic murmurs with PMI in the left or sternal cranial region. This study is the first to describe an efficient technique for in-water dolphin cardiac auscultation, and to present evidence that heart murmurs are common in bottlenose dolphins. © Copyright © 2020 Linnehan, Hsu, Gomez, Huston, Takeshita, Colegrove, Rowles, Barratclough, Musser, Harms, Cendejas, Zolman, Balmer, Townsend, Wells, Jensen, Schwacke and Smith.

ABSTRACT: In dolphinaria, dolphins and their trainers build relationships and bonds due to the nature, closeness and repeatability of their interactions, hence training sessions are deemed appropriate to evaluate dolphin welfare. Qualitative Behavioural Assessments (QBAs) have been used to study human–animal relationships and are included in several animal welfare assessments. We introduce here the first QBA aiming to analyse dolphin–trainer interactions during training sessions in terms of dolphin welfare. Our results show that “Willingness to Participate” (WtP) was significantly associated to six other parameters: high-speed approach, high level of excitement, high number of positive responses to trainers’ signals, rare refusal to perform certain behaviours, rare spontaneous departure behaviours and fast approach once the trainer entered into the pool. Therefore, we suggest using WtP and those “alerting factors” when assessing dolphin–trainer interactions under professional care. The evaluation should also consider the time of day, the dolphin’s age, trainer experience level, the nature of the training sessions and to a lesser extent the sex of the dolphins, as contributing and modulating factors. The factor eye contact has been used in various HARs studies and has been proven to be a valid indicator in welfare research works, hence potentially deserving further research. These results demonstrate the pertinence and feasibility of this approach, the ease of use of this methodology by professionals in zoo/aquarium settings and the appropriateness of the obtained results within the holistic frame of animal welfare. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a coastal dolphin endemic to the south-western Atlantic Ocean. Incidental captures in fishing gillnets are the greatest conservation concern for this species. The present study examines the biophysical interactions between the franciscana prey composition and the marine environment. The feeding regime of franciscana was investigated from stomach contents of incidentally caught animals along the southern Brazilian coast. The characteristics of the franciscana habitat may reveal potential factors affecting the distribution and abundance of marine species, thus the franciscana prey (species number and size) was treated as a function of the oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a), and the spatial (latitude and water depth), and temporal (season) parameters, through Linear and Generalized Linear Models (LM and GLM). Season and latitude were important predictors of the franciscana diet, followed by water temperature and depth. Chla parameter only influenced one fish species and therefore was not useful as an explanatory variable for our study. The influence of the predictors and prey distribution of the franciscana diet are similar to that found in the habitat by research cruise data. Some structures analysed (e.g. squid beaks) may remain longer in the stomachs. Therefore, the findings not only suggest a fairly opportunistic behaviour but it is likely that franciscana may occupy, and possibly for long periods, small spatial ranges. This behaviour might be a strategy for minimizing energetic costs by restricting movements to short distance areas, which can be an important factor for conservation planning along the southern Brazilian coast. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of a population’s abundance is of primary importance for conservation management. However, robust estimates of abundance are often difficult to obtain, especially for cetaceans which spend most of their lives submerged. Cetacean abundance is commonly estimated using aerial or vessel-based line transect surveys and distance sampling methods. During 2012–2014, the first line transect surveys to estimate cetacean abundance were conducted in Namibian waters. Surveys took place in the Namibian Islands’ Marine Protected Area (NIMPA), a large MPA located along the southern Namibian coastline. A combined visual and acoustic double-platform survey configuration was used to investigate the factors affecting detectability of the endemic Heaviside’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) and dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus obscurus). The present analysis estimates the probability of detection on the transect line (g(0)) for these two species and generates density and abundance estimates which incorporate a correction for both animals missed on the transect line and attractive responsive movement. The average annual baseline density and abundance estimates for Heaviside’s dolphins in the NIMPA region during 2012–2014 were 0.08 individuals/km2 (CV = 28.6%, 95% CI = 0.04–0.15 individuals/km2) and 1594 individuals (CV = 28.6%, 95% CI = 776–3275), respectively. The average annual baseline density and abundance estimates for dusky dolphins in the NIMPA region during 2012–2014 were 0.16 individuals/km2 (CV = 26.2%, 95% CI = 0.10–0.28 individuals/km2) and 3493 individuals (CV = 26.2%, 95% CI: 2015–6052), respectively. A discussion on the distribution of Heaviside’s and dusky dolphins is provided for this region where such information is urgently needed. Based on existing knowledge of the species and area, these estimates are regarded as reasonable. They indicate moderate sized populations of animals within the NIMPA and provide an important first baseline on which future estimates can build. © Copyright © 2020 Martin, Gridley, Roux and Elwen.

ABSTRACT: Coastal and offshore ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins have been recognized in the western South Atlantic, and it is possible that trophic niche divergence associated with social interactions is leading them to genetic and phenotypic differentiation. The significant morphological differentiation observed between these ecotypes suggests they represent two different subspecies. However, there is still a need to investigate whether there is congruence between morphological and genetic data to rule out the possibility of ecophenotypic variation accompanied by gene flow. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence data and 10 microsatellite loci collected from stranded and biopsied dolphins sampled in coastal and offshore waters of Brazil as well as 106 skulls for morphological analyses were used to determine whether the morphological differentiation was supported by genetic differentiation. There was congruence among the data sets, reinforcing the presence of two distinct ecotypes. The divergence may be relatively recent, however, given the moderate values of mtDNA nucleotide divergence (dA = 0.008), presence of one shared mtDNA haplotype and possibly low levels of gene flow (around 1% of migrants per generation). Results suggest the ecotypes may be in the process of speciation and reinforce they are best described as two different subspecies until the degree of nuclear genetic divergence is thoroughly evaluated: Tursiops truncatus gephyreus (coastal ecotype) and T. t. truncatus (offshore ecotype). The endemic distribution of T. t. gephyreus in the western South Atlantic and number of anthropogenic threats in the area reinforces the importance of protecting this ecotype and its habitat. © 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: The Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in Hong Kong is on the verge of extinction, as it has been facing multiple human-induced threats. Dolphin-watching tours have provided great opportunities for raising public awareness of the conservation of the species; however, such tours may inevitably cause disturbances to dolphins if tourists do not behave responsibly. This study aims to assess the drivers of the environmentally responsible behaviour (ERB) of tourists in terms of motivation, interpretative knowledge enhancement (IKE) and satisfaction. A questionnaire survey was administered to participants of dolphin-watching tours in Tai O, a popular dolphin-watching destination in Hong Kong. A total of 745 questionnaire samples were collected, and structural equation modelling was performed for the analysis. The results show that motivation, IKE and satisfaction were all positively and significantly correlated with ERB, whereas IKE and satisfaction were found to mediate the relationship between motivation and ERB. IKE was found to be a stronger predictor of ERB than satisfaction. The following practical implications for ecotourism are drawn: 1) it is important to include interpretation for management and education in ecotourism; and 2) the content of interpretation should include conservation messages and suggestions for behavioural changes. © 2020 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Background: Herpesvirus infections in cetaceans have always been attributed to the Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. To date, gammaherpesviruses have not been reported in the central nervous system of odontocetes. Case presentation: A mass stranding of 14 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) occurred in Cantabria (Spain) on 18th May 2019. Tissue samples were collected and tested for herpesvirus using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for cetacean morbillivirus using reverse transcription-PCR. Cetacean morbillivirus was not detected in any of the animals, while gammaherpesvirus was detected in nine male and one female dolphins. Three of these males were coinfected by alphaherpesviruses. Alphaherpesvirus sequences were detected in the cerebrum, spinal cord and tracheobronchial lymph node, while gammaherpesvirus sequences were detected in the cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, pharyngeal tonsils, mesenteric lymph node, tracheobronchial lymph node, lung, skin and penile mucosa. Macroscopic and histopathological post-mortem examinations did not unveil the potential cause of the mass stranding event or any evidence of severe infectious disease in the dolphins. The only observed lesions that may be associated with herpesvirus were three cases of balanitis and one penile papilloma. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of gammaherpesvirus infection in the central nervous system of odontocete cetaceans. This raises new questions for future studies about how gammaherpesviruses reach the central nervous system and how infection manifests clinically.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Bioaccumulation of Hg and Cd from food is a complex ecological process that has been oversimplified in the past. Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) provide a powerful model to biomonitor metal concentrations in marine environments worldwide. We combined proportions-based nutritional geometry with metal analysis, stomach content analysis and the proximate composition of prey, to yield novel insights into the accumulation of Hg and Cd. Our analysis showed an age-related accumulation trend for Cd and Hg in kidney and liver, with highest concentrations found at 18 years of age. When viewed through the lens of nutritional ecology, Argentine anchovy (58.1 Mass %) and South American long-finned squid (22.7 Mass %), provided most of the dietary intake of protein (P) and lipids (L) (P:L ratio = 2.6:1.0) and also represented the main source for Cd and Hg levels accumulated in their bodies. This study presents unprecedented evidence on metal accumulation in relation to age and nutritional intake in a marine predator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Spinner dolphins, Stenella longirostris, are the primary target for marine mammal tourism in Egypt. The present study investigated the short-term effects of tourist presence on the behaviour of spinner dolphins at Sha'ab Samadai (Samadai Reef), in the southern Egyptian Red Sea. The reef has a large central lagoon where a population of spinner dolphin regularly rest from mid-morning to mid-afternoon; visitors are permitted to snorkel in the southern part of the lagoon, but not in the northern closed zone that the dolphins mainly use. Dolphin behaviour was monitored both on days when tourist boats were present and on days when they were absent. In the presence of tourists the proportion of time that the dolphins spent resting was reduced by two-thirds, whereas the times spent milling, travelling, and showing avoidance behaviour all increased. Furthermore, upon using Markov chain modelling to investigate the effect of tourist presence on the transition probabilities between dolphin activity states, significant changes were found in 10 of the 25 possible behavioural transitions, including increased probabilities of transitioning from resting to milling or travelling, from milling to travelling or avoiding, and from travelling to avoiding. These findings raise concerns that despite the management measures in place, tourist activities affect the dolphins’ behaviour to a greater extent than was previously apparent, with potential long-term negative effects on their energy budget. The study led to proposals for amending the zoning of the site and for strengthening the regulations for tourist vessels. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The impact of inbreeding on fitness has been widely studied and provides consequential inference about adaptive potential and the impact on survival for reduced and fragmented natural populations. Correlations between heterozygosity and fitness are common in the literature, but they rarely inform about the likely mechanisms. Here, we investigate a pathology with a clear impact on health in striped dolphin hosts (a nematode infection that compromises lung function). Dolphins varied with respect to their parasite burden of this highly pathogenic lung nematode (Skrjabinalius guevarai). Genetic diversity revealed by high-resolution restriction-associated DNA (43 018 RADseq single nucleotide polymorphisms) analyses showed a clear association between heterozygosity and pathogen load, but only for female dolphins, for which the more heterozygous individuals had lower Sk. guevarai burden. One locus identified by RADseq was a strong outlier in association with parasite load (heterozygous in all uninfected females, homozygous for 94% of infected females), found in an intron of the citron rho-interacting serine/threonine kinase locus (associated with milk production in mammals). Allelic variation at the Class II major histocompatability complex DQB locus was also assessed and found to be associated with both regional variation and with pathogen load. Both sex specificity and the identification of associating functional loci provide insight into the mechanisms by which more inbred individuals may be more susceptible to the infection of this parasite. This provides important insight towards our understanding of the impact of inbreeding in natural populations, relevant to both evolutionary and practical conservation considerations. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Although the presence of Brucella spp. in the western Pacific has been suggested by epidemiological studies on cetaceans, it has not been confirmed by bacterial isolation. Here, for the first time, we report that a marine Brucella strain was isolated in the western Pacific from a bottlenose dolphin with osteomyelitis. The isolate from the lesion was confirmed to be B. ceti of sequence type 27 by multilocus sequence typing and Bruce-ladder PCR. Infrequent-restriction-site PCR and omp2 gene sequencing revealed that molecular characteristics of this isolate were similar to those of Brucella DNA previously detected from minke whales in the western North Pacific. These results suggest that genetically related Brucella strains circulate in cetacean species in this region. © 2020 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring the abundance of mobile and wide-ranging cetacean populations for conservation management is challenging, especially when the management is focused on static protected areas. Where abundance estimates are derived from mark–recapture data, such as photo-identification of naturally marked individuals, unpredictable movements of animals in and out of the survey area can reduce ‘capture’ probabilities and affect the precision and accuracy of resulting estimates. A Bayesian hierarchical log–linear model was applied to photo-identification data collected in summer 2014 to derive a multi-site abundance estimate for a population of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, ranging widely throughout the coastal waters of western Ireland. In addition, the effects of varying levels of sampling effort on the minimum detectable decrease in population size were examined. The abundance (median) of dolphins was estimated as 189 (coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean), 0.11; 95% highest-posterior density interval, 162–232). Over 50% of the well-marked dolphins encountered throughout the study were sighted in more than one distinct coastal area, thus displaying high mobility. In addition, it was found that it would require biennial surveys to detect a 25% decline in abundance within the six-year reporting period of the EU’s Habitats Directive. Given that the Special Area of Conservation designated for these dolphins consists of two separate areas covering a substantial portion of the west coast of Ireland, the multisite approach is appropriate for monitoring this population. It produces a more precise estimate and is well suited for sparse recapture data collected opportunistically at multiple sites, when the lack of resources prevents large-scale surveys or when concentrating surveys on smaller localized areas fails to capture the broad range and unpredictable occurrence of the animals. The Bayesian multi-site approach could be applied to the management of other wide-ranging marine or terrestrial taxa. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A previously undescribed skin abnormality, referred to as “linear skin markings” (LSM), has been identified in free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (IRL). The lesions were identified during photo-identification surveys conducted from 2002 and 2015. LSM presented as distinct, parallel lines running dorso-ventrally on the torso and varied in length and width. The goals of this study were to determine (1) prevalence of the condition in IRL dolphins, (2) age and sex distribution of affected animals, (3) spatial and temporal distribution patterns, (4) duration of the condition, and (5) development of hypotheses regarding the etiology of the condition. Among 1,357 individual dolphins identified during the study period, 96 (7.0%) showed evidence of LSM. Nearly all (98.8%) cases with an established home range occurred in the northern and central regions of the IRL. The majority of cases of known sex were female (85%), of which 100% had given birth to one or more calves. The mean age of animals with LSM when first observed was 7.3 with a range of 1–20 years. The maximum observed duration of LSM was 15 years. Once observed, the condition persisted indefinitely. The etiology of LSM has not been established. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Robust population size estimates are essential for informing population conservation status. Residency dynamics show population habitat use through time. Population size of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) has been extensively investigated in Chinese waters, but their residency dynamics are rarely known. Mark-recapture analysis based on photo-identification records was applied to humpback dolphins in the Dafengjiang River Estuary habitat, one of the key habitats in the northern Beibu Gulf, China. Movement analyses based on lagged identification rate indicated the humpback dolphins spent, on average, 78.5 days inside and 46.9 days outside the survey area. Within the study area, the humpback dolphin abundance was 83 identifiable dolphins. A total of 353–430 humpback dolphins, estimated by POPAN modeling, were involved in this fluid habitat-use dynamic. Robust Design analysis showed strong seasonality in humpback dolphin abundance and emigration probability, implying a movement- and habitat-use pattern likely associated with spatiotemporal distribution of oceanographic characteristics and prey occurrences. Population surveys and conservation measures currently conducted in Chinese waters seldom consider seasonality in movements between habitat patches, which can be addressed by genetic analyses across habitats and cross-matching photo-identification records among neighboring habitats. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: We investigated between 2014 and 2016 the concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and HCB and trace elements in blubber and skin samples of Australian humpback and snubfin dolphins collected from the Fitzroy River estuary and Port Curtis, Queensland, Australia. The concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and HCB from this study were compared with results from samples collected in 2009 and 2010 from the same areas. Our results showed that the concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and HCB have increased over time. A large proportion (~68%) of the sampled population accumulated organochlorines contaminants above thresholds over which immunosuppression and reproductive anomalies are known to occur. Results also suggest a general enrichment of some trace elements above natural levels in humpback and snubfin dolphins from the Fitzroy River estuary and Port Curtis. Extensive flooding in adjacent catchments is the most likely primary factor responsible for increased distribution and bioavailability of these contaminants into coastal waters. Land-based pollution from the adjacent catchments is an ongoing threat to coastal systems and particularly for top predators such as dolphins in the Great Barrier Reef. Climate change models predict increasing frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events that will impact coastal Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef. Reduction of land-based persistent pollutants into coastal waters of the Great Barrier Reef will be critical for the health and survival of humpback and snubfin dolphins in this region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans often inhabit a dynamic ocean environment; therefore, a standard approach to estimating abundance faces the difficult task of discriminating between actual population trends and habitat shifts. In addition, because of the wide distribution of many cetaceans, it is often difficult to survey their entire habitat at one time, which makes it difficult to compare abundance estimates between years and to detect a trend. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian habitat model to estimate the abundance and habitat distribution of Risso's dolphins in the western North Pacific. Based on information criteria, a model including depth, temperature, and yearly trends performed better than a model including only depth and temperature. The medians (with 95% credible intervals) of total abundance estimates in June were 54,479 dolphins (25,579–102,086) in 2006, 54,737 dolphins (26,925–103,932) in 2007, and 146,179 dolphins (75,352–264,115) in 2014. Abundance was also estimated in August, but the seasonal difference between June and August was minor. Our models estimated that high densities of Risso's dolphins occurred in the mixed-water region off northern Japan and the cold-water mass off central Japan. These are productive waters because of their complex hydrographic features. Our results showed a probable increase in abundance and not simply a shift in habitat conditions or seasonal migration patterns. This study provides a framework for monitoring widely dispersed species in a dynamic environment, which can improve management and conservation in terms of more reliable trend estimation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The life history of Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) remains poorly known and data from strandings can help provide important information. Data from 126 Risso's dolphins stranded or bycaught along the southeastern coastline of South Africa between 1958 and 2017 were analyzed in relation to their sex, age structure, and diet. Mean estimated length at birth was 146.9 cm, while maximum length was 325 cm for males and 313 cm for females; small sample sizes precluded detailed examination of sexual dimorphism. Age estimates for 33 individuals (14 males, 17 females, 2 unknown sex) indicated a maximum age of 13 years (males) and 17 years (females), respectively; the oldest animal was 19 years (unknown sex). Mean length and age at attainment of sexual maturity were estimated at 280 cm and 7.1 years in males and at 282 cm and 7.7 years in females. Stomach contents from 27 individuals showed that diets of immature and mature males and females overlapped and consisted predominantly of cephalopods. Reported strandings decreased between 2000 and 2017, possibly due to a lack of reporting associated with a ban on driving on beaches or related to the collapse of the local “chokka” squid (Loligo reynaudii) fishery in 2014–2015. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The coast of Fujian Province is a key area for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), but the characteristics of their preferred habitats are poorly defined. The species distribution model, MaxEnt, was used to predict suitable habitat distributions of humpback dolphins in Fujian, China. The model indicated that the distance to the coastline (63.5% contribution), chlorophyll-a levels (20.2%) and the bathymetry (15.6%) were important predictors of humpback dolphin habitats. The model predicted 2,043.96 km2 of highly suitable habitat that was concentrated in five areas. Four are known to be within the area of the current distribution of humpback dolphins; Putian was identified as a new area with suitable habitat, however, it is unclear if dolphins are present. The predicted locations of suitable humpback dolphin habitats provided in this study should be the focus of future research and nature reserve designs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Capture myopathy (CM) is described in wild animals as a metabolic syndrome resulting from the extreme stress suffered during and after capture, handling, restraint, and transport. Although CM has been characterized in many species of cetaceans, descriptions of cardiac injury— an important component of this syndrome, and, according to previous authors, comparable to the existing human pathology so-called stress cardiomyopathy (SCMP)—are still rare. Therefore, the main aim of this report is to illustrate, for the first time, the biochemical analysis, and gross, histopathological, histochemical and immunohistochemical features of CM, and more specifically of the SCMP involved in this syndrome, caused by the live-stranding and consequent rehabilitation attempt, for a certain period of time, in a juvenile male Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus). The animal presented elevated values of creatine kinase, cardiac troponin I and blood urea nitrogen, with some variations during the rehabilitation period. Histologically, we detected vascular changes and acute degenerative lesions analogous to the ones observed in humans with SCMP. We consider this study to be an important contribution to the study of cetaceans since it could help in decision-making and treatment procedures during live-strandings and improve conservation efforts by reducing the mortality of these animals. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Late initiation of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is associated with not achieving viral suppression before giving birth and increased mother-to-child transmission of HIV. We aimed to investigate virological suppression before giving birth with dolutegravir compared with efavirenz, when initiated during the third trimester. Methods: In this randomised, open-label trial, DolPHIN-2, we recruited pregnant women in South Africa and Uganda aged at least 18 years, with untreated but confirmed HIV infection and an estimated gestation of at least 28 weeks, initiating ART in third trimester. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to dolutegravir-based or efavirenz-based therapy. HIV viral load was measured 7 days and 28 days after antiretroviral initiation, at 36 weeks' gestation, and at the post-partum visit (0–14 days post partum). The primary efficacy outcome was a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL at the first post-partum visit, and the primary safety outcome was the occurrence of drug-related adverse events in mothers and infants until the post-partum visit. Longer-term follow-up of mothers and infants continues. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03249181. Findings: Between Jan 23, and Aug 15, 2018, we randomly assigned 268 mothers to dolutegravir (135) or efavirenz (133). All mothers and their infants were included in the safety analysis, and 250 mothers (125 in the dolutegravir group, 125 in the efavirenz group) and their infants in efficacy analyses, by intention-to-treat analyses. The median duration of maternal therapy at birth was 55 days (IQR 33–77). 89 (74%) of 120 in the dolutegravir group had viral loads less than 50 copies per mL, compared with 50 (43%) of 117 in the efavirenz group (risk ratio 1·64, 95% CI 1·31–2·06). 30 (22%) of 137 mothers in the dolutegravir group reported serious adverse events compared with 14 (11%) of 131 in the efavirenz group (p=0·013), particularly surrounding pregnancy and puerperium. We found no differences in births less than 37 weeks and less than 34 weeks gestation (16·4% vs 3·3%, across both groups). Three stillbirths in the dolutegravir group and one in the efavirenz group were considered unrelated to treatment. Three infant HIV infections were detected, all in the dolutegravir group, and were considered likely to be in-utero transmissions. Interpretation: Our data support the revision to WHO guidelines recommending the transition to dolutegravir in first-line ART for all adults, regardless of pregnancy or child-bearing potential.

ABSTRACT: Male Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia, have converged with humans in the formation of nested male alliances and the use of synchrony in alliance behavior. Further, the strength of association among allied male dolphins varies and the stability of alliances correlates with the rate that males consort with estrus females (and is thus a possible indicator of dominance). To examine the possibility that synchrony reflects alliance association strength and dominance relationships, we analyzed videotapes from focal follows of two groups of males that reflect the range of alliance size and the strength of association between individuals in the population. We examined two variables: leadership during synchronous behaviors, based on which animal in a synchronously surfacing pair surfaced first, and the degree of synchrony, based on temporal differences in synchronous surfacing. We predicted that closer associates would exhibit a greater degree of synchrony and that one dolphin in a dyad would consistently lead. Contrary to our predictions, the degree of synchrony was inversely related to strength of association within alliances. This surprising result suggests that individuals with less secure bonds may strive more to achieve synchrony. We found no evidence of leadership during synchronous surfacing or between synchrony and other behavioral variables. Proximate mechanisms for synchronous behavior, such as entrainment and mutual motor imitation (“the mirror game” paradigm), may inhibit leadership in this context. Our results show that synchrony during surfacing is not a useful behavior to examine for dominance relationships in wild dolphins but it may be a useful tool to examine variation in alliance relationships. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common cetaceans found in the coastal waters, estuaries, and mangroves of Ecuador. However, its population size is gradually declining in the Gulf of Guayaquil, and anthropogenic factors including habitat degradation, uncontrolled dolphin watching, dredging activities, increasing maritime traffic, underwater noise, bycatch, and marine pollution have been implicated in their decline. Very little is known about contamination by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from the Pacific coast of South America. To address this research gap, the first assessment of total mercury (THg) and POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in mangroves (El Morro Mangrove Wildlife Refuge) of the Gulf of Guayaquil, was conducted in Ecuador in 2018. Dolphin samples (i.e., skin and blubber; n = 9), were obtained using dart biopsy field methods for contaminant analysis. POP concentrations ranged from 0.56 to 13.0 mg/kg in lipid weight, while THg ranged from 1.92 to 3.63 mg/kg in dry weight. The predominant POPs were OCPs (50% of ΣPOP), followed by PCBs (46%) and PBDEs (6.0%); particularly, p,p′-DDE, the main DDT metabolite and a potent anti-androgenic, accounting for 42% of ΣPOP, ranging from 0.12 to ∼7.0 mg/kg lw, followed by PCB 153 (8.0%) and PCB 180 (5.0%). PBDE 47 accounted for 2.0% of ΣPOP. While the POP concentrations are lower than those found in dolphins from many other regions of the world, some of the THg concentrations are within the concentration range found in dolphins from the southeastern coast of the United States. The ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that some of the sampled dolphins are exposed to immunotoxic and endocrine disruption effects by POPs and mercury. The low genetic diversity of this distinctive dolphin population, likely exhibiting genetic isolation and a unique evolutionary heritage, could be lost if the population continues to decline in the face of anthropogenic threats, including chemical pollution. Our finding shows that bottlenose dolphins in coastal Ecuador are exposed to environmental contaminants and can be used as sentinel species for ecosystem health to monitor pollution in the region and to support ecotoxicological risk assessment and regional pollutant management. © Copyright © 2020 Alava, Calle, Tirapé, Biedenbach, Alvarado Cadena, Maruya, Lao, Aguirre, Jiménez, Domínguez, Bossart and Fair.

ABSTRACT: Boessenecker et al. report the skeleton of a stem toothed whale, from the Oligocene of South Carolina, with intermediate locomotor adaptations between modern toothed whales and the earliest pelagic whales. This cetacean is the first large-bodied macroraptorial dolphin and highlights widespread locomotor convergence between baleen and toothed whales. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Modern whales and dolphins are superbly adapted for marine life, with tail flukes being a key innovation shared by all extant species. Some dolphins can exceed speeds of 50 km/h, a feat accomplished by thrusting the flukes while adjusting attack angle with their flippers [1]. These movements are driven by robust axial musculature anchored to a relatively rigid torso consisting of numerous short vertebrae, and controlled by hydrofoil-like flippers [2–7]. Eocene skeletons of whales illustrate the transition from semiaquatic to aquatic locomotion, including development of a fusiform body and reduction of hindlimbs [8–11], but the rarity of Oligocene whale skeletons [12, 13] has hampered efforts to understand the evolution of fluke-powered, but forelimb-controlled, locomotion. We report a nearly complete skeleton of the extinct large dolphin Ankylorhiza tiedemani comb. n. from the Oligocene of South Carolina, previously known only from a partial rostrum. Its forelimb is intermediate in morphology between stem cetaceans and extant taxa, whereas its axial skeleton displays incipient rigidity at the base of the tail with a flexible lumbar region. The position of Ankylorhiza near the base of the odontocete radiation implies that several postcranial specializations of extant cetaceans, including a shortened humerus, narrow peduncle, and loss of radial tuberosity, evolved convergently in odontocetes and mysticetes. Craniodental morphology, tooth wear, torso vertebral morphology, and body size all suggest that Ankylorhiza was a macrophagous predator that could swim relatively fast, indicating that it was one of the few extinct cetaceans to occupy a niche similar to that of killer whales. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins encountered around the Irish coast are considered part of a wide-ranging coastal community; however, knowledge on the significance of the north of Ireland for this species is limited by a lack of dedicated effort. Through social media, the opportunity now exists to gather large volumes of citizen science data in the form of high-quality images, potentially extending the spatial and temporal scope of photo-identification studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate social media as a data resource for photo-identification studies and to provide a preliminary assessment of bottlenose dolphins in the north of Ireland. Specifically, the study sought to examine the photo-identification data for spatial clustering. The study identified 54 well-marked individuals and provided evidence of potential year-round occurrence, with successful re-sightings throughout the study period (2007–2016). There was a geographic concentration of re-sightings along the north of Ireland, suggestive of interannual site fidelity. These results provide scientific rationale for strategically targeting the north of Ireland in future research on the Irish coastal community. For effective conservation of the bottlenose dolphin it is imperative that scientific research, and resultant management objectives, consider wide-ranging communities such as the Irish coastal community. Our research highlights data collection via social media as a cost-effective and scientifically valuable tool in the photo-identification of coastal cetaceans. We recommend that this method is used in research on low-density and wide-ranging coastal cetaceans. © 2020 Crown Copyright.

ABSTRACT: Species distribution modelling has been used to identify critical habitats for the delimitation of Marine Protected Areas. Although Marine Protected Areas may often overlap with the distribution of key marine species, illegal human activities often continue within these areas, causing negative impacts on the local biodiversity. A generalized linear model with spatial eigenvector mapping was used to investigate, for the first time, the influence of environmental variables and anthropic activities on the number of Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis sightings/grid, and to determine whether a Marine Reserve, in south-eastern Brazil, is adequate for the protection of the local population. Data were collected between May 2007 and October 2013 onboard a 7.5-m vessel with an inboard engine. The models for the different periods (annual, dry, and rainy seasons) all indicated that depth, the distance to seafood farms and fishing grounds, and mean sea surface temperatures influenced the distribution of the dolphins within the study area. The annual and seasonal models predicted that the dolphins prefer a continuous area between Cedro and Pico Islands, a large area that lies outside the limits of the Marine Reserve. Although the habitat of Ilha Grande bay is still much less degraded than that inhabited by other nearby Guiana dolphin populations, the results of the present study indicate that anthropic activities in this area influence habitat use by the dolphins. Less than 30% of the area used by the dolphins is protected by the Tamoios Ecological Station (ESEC Tamoios). Sotalia guianensis is classified as ‘Vulnerable’ in Brazil, although the marine reserve (ESEC Tamoios) does not protect the core area used by the local dolphin population. The results of the present study provide specific locations for the creation of a new multiple-use MPA, as suggested by the Brazilian National Action Plan for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans, or the inclusion of a special management programme for the area between Cedro and Pico islands to better protect the dolphins in the ESEC Tamoios buffer zone. The continuation of surveys to better understand the current and future impacts of human activities, and the development of a closer interaction with both the local community and local stakeholders will help to safeguard Ilha Grande Bay and the local Guiana dolphin population. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The freshwater tucuxi (Sotalia flluviatilis) and the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) are endemic to the Amazon-Orinoco river basin. Their conservation is hindered by human disturbance and uncertainty about total population size and distribution. In this study, we used rapid assessment questionnaires to identify threats to river dolphins in Peru and to identify priority areas for their further study and conservation. We administered questionnaires to fishers (surveyed 2010 n = 162, 2015 n = 251) and community members (surveyed 2015 only; n = 118) at 12 landing ports of the Peruvian Amazon, asking questions about their knowledge, perception and interactions with river dolphins. Dolphins were observed by interviewed fishers based across all ports except for Aguaytia port, which was subsequently excluded from further analysis. Across the sampled ports in 2010, an average of 86 % of fishers (range: 59–100%; n = 8 ports) associated dolphins with negative economic impacts, largely due to net damage with similar findings in the more extensive survey in 2015 (74%, 27–100%; n = 11 ports). Bycatch of dolphins was also reported in 11 ports, with a higher incidence in the Loreto, where up to 10 bycaught individuals per fisher per year were reported for both time periods. The use of dolphins as bait has been practised from at least 2010 (2010: 31% of fishers, 11–57%; 2015: 31%, 0–63%) and is prevalent (>40%) in four of the surveyed ports (Caballococha, Bagazan, Requena and Manantay). Our study can be used as a first reference to guide monitoring of river dolphin populations in priority areas. Future efforts should revisit and extend this survey to other ports in Peru. Doing so will enable detection of trends in fisheries conflicts with river dolphins and improve the estimation of bycatch and direct take of dolphins in the Peruvian Amazon. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: A captive adult female bottlenose dolphin presented with stillbirth. The placenta appeared oedematous. No other gross lesions were evident in the placenta or the stillborn calf. Histopathology revealed mild multifocal placentitis and foetal encephalitis. Brucella sp. was isolated from lung, liver, spleen and kidney. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated this organism to be most similar to Brucella ceti sequence type (ST) 27. Brucella sp. DNA was detected in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded placenta and brain by real-time PCR using primers targeting the IS711 gene. Immunohistochemical staining revealed Brucella sp. antigen in placental inflammation. This is the first report of isolation of Brucella sp. from a marine mammal in the Southern Hemisphere and the first report of marine Brucella-associated disease in Australia. © 2020 Australian Veterinary Association

ABSTRACT: Little research has been conducted on the somatosensory system of toothed whales and it remains uncertain how tactile sensitivity varies about their bodies. In this study, tactile sensitivity to high-frequency (250-Hz) displacement of the skin was quantified in three trained adult common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) using a vibratory device (tactor). The magnitude of skin displacement was controlled by varying the voltage to the tactor held against the skin surface with a constant force. Tactile thresholds were determined using an adaptive method of limits in which dolphins reported perception of the tactile stimulus by producing a whistle. Displacement thresholds ranged from 2.4 to 40 μm, with the greatest sensitivity found along the rostrum, melon, and blowhole. Sensitivity decreased caudally along the body, with the dorsal fin and tip of the fluke being the least sensitive locations tested. The results support hypotheses that the follicles on the dolphin rostrum are particularly important for perception. The reduction in tactile sensitivity at the appendages is consistent with their primary role in stabilization and locomotion compared to exploration or environmental sensing. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Relationships between social status and relative position of group-living animals have been described in a variety of species. For wild cetaceans, who spend most of their time underwater, collecting detailed, continuous data to assess such relationships depends highly on group size, formation, shyness of animals and observation platform. We test a new method for focal group sampling using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), focusing on one long-term followed group of 13 male Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) in the Azores, Portugal. We aim to assess the usefulness of a UAV in delivering robust data to evaluate sociality in relation to relative position. Our analysis is based on recordings of synchronous breathing events, which are taken as an indicator of association strength. Twenty-one separate UAV flights were performed during seven surveys in July–August 2017, recording 2,886 breathing events and 571 synchronous dyads. Results showed strong differences in sociality between individuals and identified two strongly associated pairs, one strongly associated trio and six less associated individuals within the group. We subsequently created continuous time series of relative positions by interpolation of the positions recorded with the UAV at breathing events, and applied the Dynamic Time Warping method to assess associations based on relative position. This analysis identified more detailed association patterns than the synchrony analysis, and revealed a correlation between measures of sociality and relative position, at an individual and sub-cluster level, which may indicate dominant relationships. We compared results with those obtained with Photo-ID to assess any observation bias related to using a UAV. We found that 37% more breathing events were recorded with the UAV, and 21% more synchronous dyads detected, compared with Photo-ID, collected over the same observation periods, but, based on synchrony data, both methods yielded very similar results. We conclude that using a UAV for focal group follows of Risso’s dolphins enables a more granular study of association patterns than Photo-ID, by taking into account the relative position of individuals. The correlation found between measures of sociality and relative position holds promise for using UAVs in future studies of dominant relationships in Risso’s dolphins and other cetacean species. © Copyright © 2020 Hartman, van der Harst and Vilela.

ABSTRACT: The studies on the variation of acoustic communication in different species have provided insight that genetics, geographic isolation, and adaptation to ecological and social conditions play important roles in the variability of acoustic signals. The dolphin whistles are communication signals that can vary significantly among and within populations. Although it is known that they are influenced by different environmental and social variables, the factors influencing the variation between populations have received scant attention. In the present study, we investigated the factors associated with the acoustic variability in the whistles of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), inhabiting two Mediterranean areas (Sardinia and Croatia). We explored which factors, among (a) geographical isolation of populations, (b) different environments in terms of noise and boat presence, and (c) social factors (including group size, behavior, and presence of calves), were associated with whistle characteristics. We first applied a principal component analysis to reduce the number of collinear whistle frequency and temporal characteristics and then generalized linear mixed models on the first two principal components. The study revealed that both geographic distance/isolation and local environment are associated with whistle variations between localities. The prominent differences in the acoustic environments between the two areas, which contributed to the acoustic variability in the first principal component (PC1), were found. The calf's presence and foraging and social behavior were also found to be associated with dolphin whistle variation. The second principal component (PC2) was associated only with locality and group size, showing that longer and more complex tonal sound may facilitate individual recognition and cohesion in social groups. Thus, both social and behavioral context influenced significantly the structure of whistles, and they should be considered when investigating acoustic variability among distant dolphin populations to avoid confounding factors. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) are regularly present in continental shelf areas of the South-western Atlantic. However, there is little information on the natural history and ecology of these delphinids. This study evaluated the occurrence, habitat use and individual movements of the species in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro, south-eastern Brazil. Data were obtained from boat surveys between August 2011 and May 2018, during which rough-toothed dolphins were sighted in 21 distinct events, predominantly in autumn and winter. The mean group size was 29 individuals. Rough-toothed dolphins were usually recorded 130 to 2300 m from the coast, between 7.6 and 28 m depths. In total, 115 individuals were catalogued through dorsal fin marks and 61 (53%) were resighted between one (47.5%) and four (9.8%) occasions. The interval between resightings ranged from seven to 2087 days (mean = 268). Agglomerative hierarchical clustering indicated 30 individuals (49.2%) in low degree, 12 (19.7%) in medium degree and 19 (31.1%) in high degree of site fidelity. Dolphins showed a higher frequency of low degree of habitat use, despite the presence of multiyear recaptures, which may be related to the prevalence of dolphin occurrence in autumn and winter, a large home range and/or the abundance and distribution of food resources. Dedicated surveys and regional collaboration are needed to evaluate the home range and population status of this species for their effective conservation. Our findings enhanced knowledge of this little studied species facing increasing anthropogenic threats in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasonography is widely used in veterinary medicine for the diagnosis of pregnancy, and can also be used to monitor abnormal pregnancies, embryonic resorption, or fetal abortion. Ultrasonography plays an important role in modern-day cetacean preventative medicine because it is a non-invasive technique, it is safe for both patient and operator, and it can be performed routinely using trained responses that enable medical procedures. Reproductive success is an important aspect of dolphin population health, as it is an indicator of the future trajectory of the population. The aim of this study is to provide additional relevant data on feto-maternal ultrasonographic monitoring in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) species, for both the clinicians and for in situ population studies. From 2009 to 2019, serial ultrasonographic exams of 11 healthy bottlenose dolphin females kept under human care were evaluated over the course of 16 pregnancies. A total of 192 ultrasound exams were included in the study. For the first time, the sonographic findings of the bottlenose dolphin organogenesis and their correlation with the stage of pregnancy are described. Furthermore, this is the first report that forecasts the cephalic presentation of the calf at birth, according to its position within the uterus. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed patterns of aggregation and spatial distribution of the epizoic barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis on the flukes of Mediterranean striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba, assessing its potential use as an indicator of the host's hydrodynamics based on data from 55 dolphins. Barnacles occurred along the trailing edge with the cirri oriented towards the oncoming flow. Nearest neighbor analyses suggested that new recruits actively seek placement next to already settled barnacles, forming aggregations possibly to facilitate copulation. The probability of spanwise settlement strongly increased with fluke width (presumably enabling prolonged leading-edge vorticity), and with chordwise length where pressure is predicted to be positive. Consequently, clustering tended to increase nonlinearly towards the fluke notch. Furthermore, it was three times more likely for barnacles to occur on the dorsal vs. ventral side of flukes, at an average abundance ca. 12 times higher. This difference could result from a host's asymmetric oscillation of the tail, which would alter leading-edge vorticity, and/or an interaction between the wake produced by the dorsal fin and the flow associated with flukes. Both processes could primarily enhance cyprid contact and/or attachment on the dorsal side. This study offers a starting point for future comparison with other cetaceans. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Parasite monitoring is considered a necessary step for cetacean management and conservation. Between February 2013 and July 2015, 26 dolphins (15 Stenella coeruleoalba, 10 Tursiops truncatus, and one Grampus griseus) stranded along the Tuscan coastline of the protected marine area “Pelagos Sanctuary”, were examined. Organs, tissues, and faecal and blood samples taken from all animals were analysed by parasitological, immunological, and molecular techniques. Twenty-one out of 26 dolphins (80.77%) tested positive for at least one parasite species, and 13/15 (86.7%) S. coeruleoalba, 7/10 (70%) T. truncatus, and the single G. griseus were found positive. Identified parasites included the nematodes Skrjabinalius guevarai (7.69%, 2/26), Halocercus lagenorhynchi (3.85%, 1/26), Halocercus delphini (7.69%, 2/26), Stenurus ovatus (7.69%, 2/26), Crassicauda spp. (7.69%, 2/26); the trematodes Pholeter gastrophilus (26.92%, 7/26), Campula palliata (3.85%, 1/26); the cestodes Phyllobothrium delphini (42.31%, 11/26), Monorygma grimaldii (23.08%, 6/26), Tetrabothrium forsteri (7.69%, 2/26), Strobilocephalus triangularis (7.69%, 2/26), and the acanthocephalan Bolbosoma vasculosum (7.69%, 2/26). Moreover, 6/26 (23%) animals scored positive to Toxoplasma gondii at serology, but PCR confirmed the infection (T. gondii Type II genotype) in a single animal. In examined dolphins, obtained results showed a high prevalence of endoparasites, which included species considered as a cause of severe debilitation or death. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) exposed to freshwater or low salinity (<10 practical salinity units; PSU) for prolonged periods of time have been documented to develop skin lesions, corneal edema and electrolyte abnormalities, and in some instances they have died. Here we review a case of an out-of-habitat subadult, female common bottlenose dolphin that remained in a freshwater lake in Seminole, Alabama for at least 32 days. Due to concerns for the dolphin's health a rescue was initiated. At the time of rescue bloodwork results indicated minor electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoosmolality). Renal function was not affected (normal creatinine and urea nitrogen) and all other bloodwork parameters (hemogram; serum biochemistry analytes) were within normal limits. The dolphin was deemed healthy enough for immediate relocation and release. A satellite-linked tag was attached to the dorsal fin to track the dolphin following its relocation to a nearby brackish water bay (Perdido Bay, AL), a known habitat for bottlenose dolphins. Twelve weeks following release, the dolphin was found dead as a result of a fisheries interaction (peracute underwater entrapment). A full necropsy was conducted and there was complete resolution of the skin pallor and skin lesions and no evidence of chronic renal or central nervous system lesions. Post-mortem analysis of vitreous humor (used as a proxy for serum analytes and to determine post-mortem interval) was challenging to interpret and has not been validated in dolphins. This supports the need for future research in cetaceans to establish a species-specific approach. Elevated barium (Ba) concentrations in tooth dentin corresponded to increased seasonal freshwater discharge patterns, confirming repeated annual exposure to low salinity conditions prior to death and indicating freshwater exposure may pose an ongoing threat to dolphins in the region. This case provides a unique opportunity to follow the progression of prolonged freshwater exposure and recovery in a bottlenose dolphin and highlights that dolphins in nearshore habitats face a combination of persistent natural and human associated threats. © Copyright © 2020 Deming, Wingers, Moore, Rotstein, Wells, Ewing, Hodanbosi and Carmichael.

ABSTRACT: Background: While cetaceans have been extensively studied around the world, nocturnal movements and habitat use have been largely unaddressed for most populations. We used satellite telemetry to examine the nocturnal movements and habitat use of four bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from a well-studied population in a complex estuary along the east coast of Florida. This also enabled us to explore the utility of satellite tracking on an apex predator within a very narrow and convoluted ecosystem. Our objectives were to evaluate (1) nocturnal home ranges and how individual dolphins moved within them, (2) nocturnal utilization of habitats surrounding ocean inlets, (3) nocturnal movements outside of the population's known range (i.e., the study area), and (4) nocturnal use of select environmental variables. Results: Satellite tags were active between 129 and 140 days (136 ± 4.99) during nocturnal hours (summer/fall 2012), yielding 3.3 ± 1.4 high-quality transmissions per night. Results indicated substantial individual variation among the four tagged dolphins, with home ranges varying in length from 53.9 to 83.6 km (x&macr; = 71.9 ± 12.9). Binomial tests and MaxEnt models revealed some dolphins preferred habitats surrounding inlets, seagrass habitats, and various water depths, while other dolphins avoided these areas. All dolphins, however, showed substantial movement (x&macr; = 5.8 ± 7.4 km) outside of the study area, including travel into rivers/canals and the adjoining ocean (6.0-8.6% and 0.8-2.9% of locations per dolphin, respectively). Conclusions: This study was the first to utilize satellite telemetry on Indian River Lagoon dolphins and provided the first detailed insights into the nocturnal movements and habitat use of this population. Our findings suggest that while individual dolphin home ranges may overlap, they use different foraging strategies, feed on different prey, and/or exhibit intraspecific resource partitioning. In contrast with a prior study, all tagged dolphins showed considerable movement into the adjoining ocean and freshwater sources. This suggests this population has a much larger range than previously thought, which is important to consider for future research and conservation efforts. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have been surveyed for at least two decades on the southern Brazilian coast. However, little is known about their distribution and habitat use in lower latitudes of the South-western Atlantic Ocean. Aiming to study the movements and distribution of the species along the south-eastern Brazilian coast, we made a comparison of photo-identified individuals of the species catalogued in 21 cruises conducted between 2012 and 2015. Additionally, we performed stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen in skin samples (N = 35) to provide some insights of dolphin habitat use and trophic ecology through comparisons among individuals of distinct surveyed sectors (northern and southern) and sex. A total of 177 individuals were identified. Re-sightings (N = 24) occurred at intervals from 82 to 979 days at distances from 7 to 179 km. No individual was sighted in both sectors, suggesting spatial segregation. Isotopic comparisons showed no significant differences in carbon and nitrogen signatures between distinct sectors. However, ecological divergences were found when we divided the samples by gender. Wider isotopic niches were found for the northern bottlenose dolphins vs the southern ones, which could be related to temporal and spatial variation in the availability of resources, as well as possible differences in the home ranges of males and females in each region. This study represents a preliminary evaluation of ecological aspects of bottlenose dolphins along the Brazilian south-eastern coast, however, long-term studies on the feeding ecology and habitat use of this species are important to further improve our knowledge.

ABSTRACT: Cultural behavior, which is transmitted among conspecifics through social learning [1], is found across various taxa [2–6]. Vertical social transmission from parent to offspring [7] is thought to be adaptive because of the parental generation being more skilled than maturing individuals. It is found throughout the animal kingdom, particularly in species with prolonged parental care, e.g., [8, 9]. Social learning can also occur among members of the same generation [4, 10, 11] or between older, non-parental individuals and younger generations [7] via horizontal or oblique transmission, respectively. Extensive work on primate culture has shown that horizontal transmission of foraging behavior is biased toward species with broad cultural repertoires [12] and those with increased levels of social tolerance [13, 14], such as great apes. Vertical social transmission has been established as the primary transmission mechanism of foraging behaviors in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population of Shark Bay, Western Australia [6, 9, 15, 16]. Here, we investigated the spread of another foraging strategy, “shelling” [17], whereby some dolphins in this population feed on prey trapped inside large marine gastropod shells. Using a multi-network version of “network-based diffusion analysis” (NBDA), we show that shelling behavior spreads primarily through non-vertical social transmission. By statistically accounting for both environmental and genetic influences, our findings thus represent the first evidence of non-vertical transmission of a foraging tactic in toothed whales. This research suggests there are multiple transmission pathways of foraging behaviors in dolphins, highlighting the similarities between cetaceans and great apes in the nature of the transmission of cultural behaviors.

ABSTRACT: How larvae of whale and dolphin epibionts settle on their fast-swimming and migrating hosts is a puzzling question in zoology. We successfully reared the larvae of the whale and dolphin barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis to the cyprid stage. We studied the larval developmental ecology and antennular morphology in an attempt to assess whether an epibiotic lifestyle on this extreme substratum entails any unique larval specializations. Morphological parameters were compared with five other barnacle species that also inhabit extreme substrata. We found no larval specializations to a lifestyle associated with marine mammals. The external morphology of the antennules in Xenobalanus cyprids is morphologically similar to species from strikingly different substrata. We found variation only in the structures that are in physical contact with the substratum, i.e., the third segments carrying the villi-covered attachment disc. The third segments of the Xenobalanus cyprid antennules are not spear-shaped as in the stony coral barnacles, which are here used to penetrate the live tissue of their hosts. The presence of a cyprid cement gland implies that Xenobalanus uses cement protein when attaching to its cetacean host. Naupliar instars developed outside of the mantle cavity, indicating dispersal is planktonic. Our results militate against the idea that the cyprids settle during ocean migrations of their hosts. We suggest cyprids settle during coastal aggregations of the cetacean hosts. We conclude that the ecological success of barnacles has ultimately depended on a larva that with little structural alteration possesses the ability to settle on an amazingly wide array of substrata, including cetaceans. © 2020, Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik.

ABSTRACT: This study describes the age structure and sex-specific growth patterns of Lahille's bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus), a subspecies endemic to the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWAO). The ages of 120 animals collected in southern Brazil between 1976 and 2017 were determined. We found high frequencies of young animals, mostly males, with no sex bias among adults. A temporal change in the age structure of strandings was observed, and we conclude it is a consequence of increased bycatch rates of young dolphins after 2000. The oldest male and female were 27 and 44 years old, respectively, suggesting that females live longer than males in southern Brazil. Growth curve analysis using Gompertz and Laird-Gompertz growth models estimated asymptotic lengths of 316.5 cm for females and 351.6 cm for males, (reached around 13 and 18 years old, respectively), supporting sexual size dimorphism for the subspecies. A second growth pulse was identified for males. Our work highlights the benefit of long-term studies and contributes valuable information toward understanding the life history of Lahille's bottlenose dolphin. It will serve as baseline for future studies that seek to understand mortality patterns of bottlenose dolphins elsewhere and the effects of anthropogenic actions on the survival of these animals. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Successful conservation strategies require an accurate estimation of population size, and this parameter is one of the most important factors that determine the rate of various evolutionary processes. In this study, we integrated information from genetic, photo-identification, and aerial surveys of dusky dolphins to determine the effective population size and the number of dolphins that inhabit the gulfs of Península Valdés [Golfo Nuevo (GN) and Golfo San José (GSJ)] and are exposed to tourism vessel traffic. Photo-identification sessions and biopsies samples were collected from a research vessel between 2004 and 2013 to estimate the number of dolphins in the area by capture–recapture methods and the effective population size using mtDNA data. In addition, four aerial surveys were carried out using line transects to estimate density via distance sampling. The long-term effective size estimated was 992.87–1,103.19 individuals. During the photo-identification period and by applying a mark rate of 0.416, the total estimated individuals in GN was 374 (95% CI: 237–511). For GSJ, the estimated individuals in the area were 55 (95% CI: 2–108, mark rate 0.692). From aerial surveys, the overall density estimate was D⌢ = 0.13 dolphins/km2 (95% CI: 0.052–0.35; CV: 49.60). The estimation for GN was 325 (95% CI: 130–875), whereas for GSJ, it was 104 (95% CI: 42–280) individuals. These are the first estimations of the number and the effective population size for dusky dolphins in a small-scale area along north Patagonia. Dusky dolphins groups are impacted by anthropogenic activities; therefore, the information reported here contributes population information to help to the species management and conservation. © Copyright © 2020 Degrati, Loizaga, Coscarella, Sueyro, Crespo and Dans.

ABSTRACT: Individuals and groups within the same population may differ in their use of resources. Also referred to as niche specialization, such differences can be documented through direct or indirect observation of resource or habitat use. Here, we examined selective habitat use in alliance-forming male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Using 6 years of sighting data (2001–2006), we calculated the home ranges of 17 male alliances (comprising 3–14 individuals each). We defined five habitat types in the study area and measured the proportion of each habitat type in the home range of each alliance. Habitat selectivity was examined using selection ratios of used and available habitat within alliance home ranges. Since home range is also a form of habitat selection, we also examined selection ratios of alliances within defined subareas within the study area. Subareas were the combined home ranges of subsets of alliances that were linked by general location, distinctive habitat features and seasonal movement patterns. During each sighting, the predominant group behaviour was recorded. We analysed data from all sightings (which included all behavioural types: resting, travelling, socializing and foraging), as well as a restricted set of foraging groups only. For all sightings, alliances were selective of habitat within each of three subareas (northern, central, southern), and 14 alliances were selective of habitat within their home range. For foraging sightings, alliances within all three subareas were selective with respect to foraging habitat, and seven alliances showed significant selection of foraging habitat within their respective home ranges. Some alliances with broadly overlapping ranges foraged in different habitats. Alliance-specific habitat use may be influenced by ecological and social factors. Our results raise the possibility that the considerable variation in alliance size within this population may be influenced by the distribution of food as well as the distribution of females. © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Marine organisms face relatively few barriers to gene flow, and yet even highly mobile species such as dolphins often show population structure over regional geographic scales. Understanding the processes that promote this pattern of differentiation helps us understand the evolutionary radiation of this group, and to promote more effective measures for conservation. Here we report the first population genetic study of Fraser's dolphin Lagenodelphis hosei (Fraser, 1956), a species that was not recognized by the scientific communities until the early 1970s. We use 18 microsatellite DNA loci and 1 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) locus to compare 112 Fraser's dolphins collected in various locations, mainly from the waters off Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, but also including samples from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Our results indicate differentiation between populations in waters off Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, and support the findings from earlier morphological assessments for differentiation between Japanese and Philippine waters. Small sample sets also show likely differentiation between other regions in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Moreover, neutrality tests and mismatch analysis based on mtDNA data indicate that the populations in the western North Pacific Ocean have expanded demographically and spatially, possibly since the latest global deglaciation, when sea levels and global temperatures started to rise. © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of the population dynamics and residency of common bottlenose dolphin around Reunion Island (southwest Indian Ocean). Understanding dynamics and movement patterns of this local population is essential to guide effective conservation efforts, notably in a context of growing dolphin-watching activities. Dedicated surveys based on photo-identification methods were conducted over 6 years (2010–2015). The species was present year-round, in groups of 25 individuals on average (1–150). Jolly-Seber mark-recapture models resulted in a population estimate of 254 individuals (95% CI = 191–337) and an apparent annual survival rate of 0.83. The population was almost equally split into three residency patterns: residents (33.1%), long-term visitors (32.6%), and short-term visitors (34.3%, including transients, i.e., individuals only seen once [14.9%]), suggesting that the majority of the population showed a moderate-to-high level of residency in the study area. Individuals from the three residency patterns associated randomly, mixing together and forming a single community. Models based on the lagged identification rate indicated emigration and reimmigration to the survey area, with some individuals occupying the study area for about 2 years (832 days), and remaining outside for an average of 276 days, probably exhibiting larger home ranges and extensive movement behavior. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans, including dolphins, serve as definitive hosts of zoonotic anisakid nematodes, which are important etiological agents for human anisakiasis and allergy-Associated health risks. With limited knowledge of these zoonotic parasites from the marine environment in the Philippine waters, the stranding of a Fraser's dolphin (Lagenodelphis hosei Fraser, 1956) off the central Philippines made it possible to identify the worm species isolated from its gut. Parasitological examinations were carried out using morphological and molecular tools. Morphologically, the SEM and LM data revealed that the specimens belong to the genus Anisakis of the Type 1 group. Molecularly, PCR-RFLP results of the ITS region generated only a single fragment pattern on all worm samples corresponding to the reported molecular keys for A.Typica. Further sequence and phylogenetic analyses of both ITS rDNA and mtDNA COX2 genes confirmed the anisakid nematodes' identity as A.Typica. The molecular data obtained in this study support previous findings on the possible existence of local variants of A.Typica in this region. © Meat Technology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna and Karnaphuli (GBMK) River Basin in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh is among the world's most biodiverse river basins. However, human-induced habitat modification processes threaten the ecological structure of this river basin. Among the GBMK’s diverse flora and fauna of this freshwater ecosystem, the endemic Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica; GRD) is one of the most charismatic species in this freshwater ecosystem. Though a >50% population size reduction has occurred since 1957, researchers and decision-makers often overlook the persistence (or evolutionary potential) of this species in the highly fragmented GBMK. We define the evolutionary potential as the ability of species/populations to adapt in a changing environment by maintaining their genetic diversity. Here, we review how evolutionary trap mechanisms affect the dynamics and viability of the GRD (hereafter Ganges dolphin) populations after rapid declines in their population size and distribution. We detected six potential trap mechanisms that might affect the Ganges dolphin populations discretely or in combination: (a) habitat modification; (b) occurrence of finite and geographically restricted local populations; (c) ratio of effective to estimate population size; (d) increasing risk of inbreeding depression in genetically isolated groups; (e) at-risk behavioral attributes; and (f) direct fisheries–dolphin interactions. Because evolutionary traps appear most significant during low water season, they adversely affect demographic parameters, which reduce evolutionary potential. These traps have already caused local extirpation events; therefore, we recommend translocation among populations, including restoring and preserving essential habitats as immediate conservation strategies. Integrative evolutionary potential information based on demographic, genetic, and environmental data is still lacking. Thus, we identify gaps in the knowledge and suggest integrative approaches to understand the future of Ganges dolphins in South Asian waterways. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Wild dolphin-swim tourism has grown in specific locations where Hawaiian spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) have known resting habitat. The increased growth in dolphin-swim businesses has created an industry in Hawaii that earns an estimated $102 million (USD) annually in 2013. Semi-structured interviews with business owners, market research, and boat-based observations provide a platform for estimating revenue generated from dolphin tourism in two popular locations, Waianae, Oahu and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii Island. A revenue analysis of dolphin-swim tourism is presented using a peak season and utilization rate model. These predictions offer an accountability exercise based on a series of assumptions regarding wild dolphin-swim demand and an annual estimate of the number of viewing participants and revenue earned. The results show that dolphin viewing companies are making a larger profit than dolphin-swim businesses by approximately $19 million (USD) per year, however, both avenues are generating large earnings. Sizable differences between businesses in Kona and Waianae are discussed. The average lifetime revenue generated by a dolphin in 2013 is estimated at $3,364,316 (USD) for Waianae and $1,608,882 (USD) for Kona, and is presented as a first step in scenario analysis for policy makers looking to implement management in the bays where tourism occurs. This study offers the first revenue estimates of spinner dolphin tourism in Hawaii, which can provide context for further discussion on the impact and economic role of the dolphin-swim industry in the state. © Copyright © 2020 Wiener, Bejder, Johnston, Fawcett and Wilkinson.

ABSTRACT: Between the 1st of February and the March 31, 2017, 793 stranded cetaceans were found along the French Atlantic coasts. Common dolphins made up 84% of these strandings, and most of these presented evidence of death in fishing gear. The aim of this work is to test an approach that could help identify the fisheries potentially involved in a given stranding event. To do this we examined how the distributions of likely areas of mortality of bycaught dolphins, inferred from carcass drift modelling, coincide with fishing effort statistics of various fleets, generated from the Vessel Monitoring System, in the area over the same dates. Using reverse drift modelling, two main mortality areas were identified. A total of 3690 common dolphins (IC95% [2230; 6900]) were estimated to have died in fishing gear within the Bay of Biscay during this unusual stranding event. There was a positive correlation between the origin of stranded bycaught dolphins and the fishing effort distribution of French midwater pair trawlers, Spanish otter bottom trawlers and French Danish seiners. This co-occurrence highlights a risk and identifies fisheries that require further investigation (through observers or e-monitoring). These fisheries differed in their fishing gear, but two characteristics appear to be shared: they targeted predatory fishes (sea bass and hake) in winter and used high vertical opening gear. © 2019 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Understanding the social organization of coastal dolphins, particularly those that reside adjacent to major cities and urbanized regions, is important for understanding the vulnerability of populations to human impacts. We investigated the sexual segregation and social dynamics in a population of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) inhabiting the near-urban embayment of Moreton Bay, Queensland. Over 160 vessel-based surveys, 148 adults were photographically identified. This included 116 assumed females and 32 assumed males. The population was sexually segregated (SSAS = 0.52, p <.001) and individuals preferred to associate with others of the same sex occupying the same spatial area (p <.025). Association indices between paired males were almost double those of females ((Formula presented.), SD = 0.04 and (Formula presented.), SD = 0.02, respectively). However, females were more gregarious than males and maintained a larger network of associates based on preferred companionships. The social network was also modular with five clusters identified, and a limited number of individuals had a disproportionate influence on connectivity between clusters. This highly fragmented social network implies that the population may be vulnerable to social disruptions from human impacts. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is increasingly being adopted as a non-invasive method for the assessment of ocean ecological dynamics. PAM is an important sampling approach for acquiring critical information about marine mammals, especially in areas where data are lacking and where evaluations of threats for vulnerable populations are required. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (IPHD, Sousa chinensis) is a coastal species which inhabits tropical and warm-temperate waters from the eastern Indian Ocean throughout Southeast Asia to central China. A new population of this species was recently discovered in waters southwest of Hainan Island, China. An array of passive acoustic platforms was deployed at depths of 10–20 m (the preferred habitat of humpback dolphins), across sites covering more than 100 km of coastline. In this study, we explored whether the acoustic data recorded by the array could be used to classify IPHD echolocation clicks, with the aim of investigating the spatiotemporal patterns of distribution and acoustic behavior of this species. A number of supervised machine learning algorithms were trained to automatically classify echolocation clicks from the different types of short-broadband pulses recorded. The best performance was reported by a cubic support vector machine (Cubic SVM), which was applied to 19,215 5-min recordings (∼4.2 TB), collected over a period of 75 days at six locations. Subsequently, using spectrogram visualization and audio listening, human operators confirmed the presence of clicks within the selected files. Additionally, other dolphin vocalizations (including whistles, buzzes, and burst pulses) and different sound sources (soniferous fishes, snapping shrimps, human activities) were also reported. The detection range of IPHD clicks was estimated using a transmission loss (TL) model and the performance of the trained classifier was compared with data synchronously collected by an acoustic data logger (A-tag). This study demonstrates that the distribution and habitat use of a coastal and resident dolphin species can be monitored over a large spatiotemporal scale, using an array of passive acoustic platforms and a data analysis protocol that includes both machine learning techniques and spectrogram inspection. © Copyright © 2020 Caruso, Dong, Lin, Liu, Gong, Xu, Alonge and Li.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean abundance estimation often relies on distance sampling methods using shipboard visual line-transect surveys, which assumes that all animals on the trackline are detected and that the detection of animals decreases with increasing distance from the trackline. Mark–Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) typically employs a secondary visual observation team and may be used to identify the fraction of animals detected on the trackline when it is suspected that animals may have been missed. For species that are difficult to detect using visual observation methods, such as deep-diving species or those with cryptic surfacing behavior, this secondary team may be prone to the same limitations in detection as the primary observation team and alternative modes of detection may improve estimates. Here we examine the potential use of passive acoustic detection as a secondary platform for MRDS of rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) during a combined visual and acoustic shipboard line-transect survey. The average trackline detection probability for rough-toothed dolphins was less than one for both the trial configuration (average p(0) = 0.45 for the visual team) and independent observer configuration (average p(0) = 0.37 for the visual, p(0) = 0.77 for the acoustic and p(0) = 0.84 for both teams combined). This study, while limited in scope, strongly suggests that passive acoustic methods may be an effective alternative for estimating p(0) for some cetaceans species. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

ABSTRACT: This study evaluated the feeding habits of the franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) in south-eastern Brazil. Stomach contents were collected from a total of 145 dead specimens found incidentally caught by fishing vessels or stranded between 2005 and 2015. Fish otoliths, cephalopod beaks and whole non-digested prey were used for prey species identification. A total of 9337 prey items were identified, including 26 species of teleost fishes and three species of cephalopods. The most important prey families were Sciaenidae among fish and Loliginidae among cephalopods. Franciscana dolphins tended to feed on small fish (mean = 5.25 cm) and cephalopods (mean = 8.57 cm). The index of relative importance (IRI) showed that Pellona harroweri and Doryteuthis plei were the most important prey for both males and females. The PERMANOVA test confirmed that there is no significant difference between the feeding habits of different sexes, but detected a significant difference among seasons. Overall, our results show that franciscana dolphins are predominantly ichthyophagous and non-selective in relation to the type of prey, feeding on pelagic, demersal and pelagic-demersal prey.

ABSTRACT: From August 26 to 30, 2017, Hurricane Harvey inundated the Galveston Bay estuary in Texas with record-breaking rainfall. As a result, salinity levels in the bay declined rapidly from an average of 14 to < 1 ppt, altering aquatic habitat in the weeks following the storm. Long-term photo-identification monitoring efforts provided an opportunity to undertake a case study describing the effects of this extreme flood event on the bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting upper Galveston Bay. We compared dolphin encounter rates for the months preceding and following Harvey to a year with no hurricane, examined shifts in habitat-based encounter rates, and evaluated the prevalence and extent of dolphin skin lesions, typically presenting as ulcerated or degraded epidermis. Encounter rates decreased from 1.09 dolphins per linear kilometer (d/km) in August 2017 before Harvey to 0.29 d/km in September 2017 (compared to 0.85 d/km in August 2016 and 0.91 d/km in September 2016). While most dolphins evacuated the upper portion of the bay, many remaining dolphins shifted habitats from shallow open bay to deep channels where salinity increased with depth. Of the dolphins that were sighted in the upper bay during the low salinity event, 96% exhibited at least one lesion and 65% of those dolphins had lesions of medium or high extent (significant increases compared to pre-Harvey levels). After salinity returned to levels above 11 ppt (approximately 8 weeks after Harvey), encounter rates increased and extent of lesions decreased, but prevalence of lesions remained elevated for at least 4 months after Harvey. © 2020, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

ABSTRACT: Bio-accumulation of high levels of persistent organic pollutants represent a serious conservation concern for Mediterranean marine odontocetes. In this study, blubber samples from 10 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded along the Italian coasts during 2015–2016 were analyzed. All specimens showed dl-PCBs > PBDEs ≫ PCDD/Fs. Median concentrations were 1820 ng/g l.w., 456 ng/g l.w. and 23.9 pg/g l.w., respectively. dl-PCBs accounted for 93.3% of total TEQs. PBDE concentrations suggest that the Mediterranean basin may be considered a hotspot for organobromine compounds. OCDD did not represent the greatest contributor to PCDD/Fs profile, most likely due to a change in dioxin environmental sources in the last two-three decades. Despite international regulations, the present study emphasized that POP exposure levels in Mediterranean striped dolphins have not declined significantly in recent years. Toxicological and risk assessment studies on this sentinel species may provide an early indication of potential adverse health effects on Mediterranean ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In the North Sea, white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) occur regularly and are the second most common cetacean in the area, while their close relative, the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), prefers the deeper waters of the northern North Sea and adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Though strandings of both species have occurred regularly in the past three decades, they have decreased in the southern North Sea during the last years. Studies describing necropsy findings in stranded Lagenorhynchus spp. are, to date, still scarce, while information gained through post-mortem examinations may reveal valuable information about underlying causes of this decline, including age structure and the reproduction status. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed and compared the necropsy results from fresh Lagenorhynchus spp. stranded along the southeastern North Sea between 1990 and 2019. A full necropsy was performed on 24 white-beaked dolphins and three Atlantic white-sided dolphins from the German and Dutch coast. Samples of selected organs were taken for histopathological, bacteriological, mycological, parasitological and virological examinations. The most common post-mortem findings were emaciation, gastritis and pneumonia. Gastritis and ulceration of the stomach was often associated with an anisakid nematode infection. Pneumonia was most likely caused by bacterial infections. Encephalitis was observed in three animals and morbillivirus antigen was detected immunohistochemically in one case. Although the animal also showed pneumonic lesions, virus antigen was only found in the brain. Parasitic infections mainly affected the gastro-intestinal tract. Lungworm infections were only detected in two cases and no associations with pathological alterations were observed. Stenurus spp. were identified in two of three cases of parasitic infections of the ears. Twelve of the 26 white-beaked dolphins stranded in Germany were found between 1993 and 1994, but there was no evidence of epizootic disease events or mass strandings during the monitored period. © Copyright © 2020 Schick, IJsseldijk, Grilo, Lakemeyer, Lehnert, Wohlsein, Ewers, Prenger-Berninghoff, Baumgärtner, Gröne, Kik and Siebert.

ABSTRACT: Tracking the origin of propagating wave signals in an environment with complex reflective surfaces is, in its full generality, a nearly intractable problem which has engendered multiple domain-specific literatures. We posit that, if the environment and sensor geometries are fixed, machine learning algorithms can “learn” the acoustical geometry of the environment and accurately track signal origin. In this paper, we propose the first machine-learning-based approach to identifying the source locations of semi-stationary, tonal, dolphin-whistle-like sounds in a highly reverberant space, specifically a half-cylindrical dolphin pool. Our algorithm works by supplying a learning network with an overabundance of location “clues”, which are then selected under supervised training for their ability to discriminate source location in this particular environment. More specifically, we deliver estimated time-difference-of-arrivals (TDOA’s) and normalized cross-correlation values computed from pairs of hydrophone signals to a random forest model for high-feature-volume classification and feature selection, and subsequently deliver the selected features into linear discriminant analysis, linear and quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian process models. Based on data from 14 sound source locations and 16 hydrophones, our classification models yielded perfect accuracy at predicting novel sound source locations. Our regression models yielded better accuracy than the established Steered-Response Power (SRP) method when all training data were used, and comparable accuracy along the pool surface when deprived of training data at testing sites; our methods additionally boast improved computation time and the potential for superior localization accuracy in all dimensions with more training data. Because of the generality of our method we argue it may be useful in a much wider variety of contexts. © 2020 Woodward et al.

ABSTRACT: The presence of pyrethroid compounds in hepatic tissue of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) is reported for the first time. Twelve pyrethroids were determined in 50 animals from eight locations of the Brazilian coast. The highest average concentration of total pyrethroids (∑PYR) was 1166 ng.g−1 lw, with values ranging from 148 to 5918 ng.g−1 lw, in Ilha Grande Bay, Rio de Janeiro State, while the Espírito Santo State had the highest median, 568 ng.g−1 lw. Permethrin was the predominant compound in most areas, contributing for 42% to 81% of the ∑PYR, whereas cypermethrin was the most abundant compound in Guanabara and Sepetiba bays (79% and 81%, respectively), both located in Rio de Janeiro State. Biological factors were not correlated with pyrethroids concentration. Tetramethrin and es/fenvalerate compounds were negatively correlated to the age, suggesting degradation/metabolization capacity in these animals that increases throughout life. Despite being metabolized and excreted, the wide use of these pollutants is reflected in relevant concentrations found in Guiana dolphins. This is the first study evaluating pyrethroids in a representative number of hepatic samples and covering >2600 km of coast. The overall lack of information on pyrethroids in cetaceans highlights the importance of understanding the profile and distribution of these pollutants in dolphins which exclusively inhabit the Southwestern Atlantic coast. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) of the Bocas del Toro archipelago are targeted by the largest boat-based cetacean watching operation in Panama. Tourism is concentrated in Dolphin Bay, home to a population of resident dolphins. Previous studies have shown that tour boats elicit short-term changes in dolphin behavior and communication; however, the relationship of these responses to the local population's biology and ecology is unclear. Studying the effects of tour boats on dolphin activity patterns and behavior can provide information about the biological significance of these responses. Here, we investigated the effects of tour boat activity on bottlenose dolphin activity patterns in Bocas del Toro, Panama over 10 weeks in 2014. Markov chain models were used to assess the effect of tour boats on dolphin behavioral transition probabilities in both control and impact scenarios. Effect of tour boat interactions was quantified by comparing transition probabilities of control and impact chains. Data were also used to construct dolphin activity budgets. Markov chain analysis revealed that in the presence of tour boats, dolphins were less likely to stay socializing and were more likely to begin traveling, and less likely to begin foraging while traveling. Additionally, activity budgets for foraging decreased and traveling increased as an effect of tour boat presence. These behavioral responses are likely to have energetic costs for individuals which may ultimately result in population-level impacts. Boat operator compliance with Panamanian whale watching regulations is urgently needed to minimize potential long-term impacts on this small, genetically distinct population and to ensure the future viability of the local tourism industry.  © 2020 Kassamali-Fox et al.

ABSTRACT: The Strait of Gibraltar is an important habitat for cetaceans due to its high marine productivity. However, it is also the second most navigated channel in the world, subjecting cetaceans to a high level of vessel traffic, including an established whale-watching fleet. Both maritime traffic and whale-watching activities have been shown to impact the behaviour of cetaceans, but little is known about their impact on the demography and dynamics of cetacean populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of both ferry traffic and whale-watching vessels on the apparent survival probability of a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) population that occurs in the Strait. A Bayesian hierarchical mark–recapture modelling approach was applied to 8 years of photo-identification data (2002–2009). Apparent annual survival probability was negatively correlated with ferry traffic, which explained >70% of temporal variation in survival, in contrast to whale-watching, the effect of which was almost negligible. Despite these results, other natural and human-related factors are likely to drive apparent survival in the study area. Abundance increased between 2002 and 2005, and then decreased between 2006 and 2009, while local per-capita recruitment decreased from 2004 until the end of the study period. These shifts correlated temporally with the construction of a large harbour on the Moroccan coast, which increased maritime traffic significantly, including a 40% increase in ferry traffic that regularly transited the Strait. These results highlight the need to better understand the impact of maritime traffic on the demography of the dolphin population in the Strait, in order to implement evidence-based conservation regulations in a region of high cetacean occurrence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Studies of the whistles of Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) have traditionally been restricted to analyses of the human audio range (below 20 kHz). In this study, broadband acoustic recordings of Irrawaddy dolphins in Brunei Bay were obtained using a sampling frequency of 512 kHz. Among the 984 whistles collected, eight (0.81%) high-frequency whistles were detected with fundamentals above 18.4 kHz, which is the reported maximum frequency. Four (50%) of these whistles had the entire fundamentals in the ultrasonic frequency range (above 20 kHz), where 52.3 kHz was the maximum frequency. This is the first description of the ultrasonic components of Irrawaddy dolphin whistles. Our findings demonstrate that the whistles of Irrawaddy dolphins span a wider frequency range than previously published. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Aquatic contamination, oil spills in particular, could lead to the accumulation of antibiotic resistance by promoting selection for and/or transfer of resistance genes. However, there have been few studies on antibiotic resistance in marine mammals in relation to environmental disturbances, specifically oil contaminations. Here we initiated a study on antibiotic resistance bacteria in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in relation to oil contamination following the 2010 BP Oil Spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance prevalence one year after the 2010 BP Oil Spill were compared between Barataria Bay (BB) and Sarasota Bay (SB) by applying the rarefaction curve method, and (generalized) linear mixed models. The results showed that the most common bacteria included Vibrio, Shewanella, Bacillus and Pseudomonas. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance was high in the bacterial isolates at both bays. Though bacterial diversity did not differ significantly among water or dolphin samples, and antibiotic resistance did not differ significantly among water samples between the two bays, antibiotic resistance and multi-drug resistance in dolphin samples was significantly higher in the BB than in the SB, mainly attributed to the resistance to E, CF, FEP and SXT. We also found sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia the first time in the natural aquatic environment. The higher antibiotic resistance in the dolphins in BB is likely attributed to 2010 BP Oil Spill as we expected SB, a more urbanized bay area, would have had higher antibiotic resistance based on the previous studies. The antibiotic resistance data gathered in this research will fill in the important data gaps and contributes to the broader spatial-scale emerging studies on antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceanpox viruses (CePVs) are associated with a cutaneous disease in cetaceans often referred to as “tattoo” lesions. To date, only partial genomic data are available for CePVs, and thus, they remain unclassified members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae within the family Poxviridae. Herein, we describe the first complete CePV genome sequenced from the tattoo lesion of a managed Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), using next-generation sequencing. The T. aduncus CePV genome (CePV-TA) was determined to encode 120 proteins, including eight genes unique to the CePV-TA and five genes predicted to function as immune-evasion genes. The results of CePV-TA genetic analyses supported the creation of a new chordopoxvirus genus for CePVs. The complete sequencing of a CePV represents an important first step in unraveling the evolutionary relationship and taxonomy of CePVs, and significantly increases our understanding of the genomic characteristics of these chordopoxviruses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Geospatial models are used to predict the distribution of terrestrial and marine species, according to their ecological and ethological habits. The bottlenose dolphin is a cosmopolitan marine top predator, inhabiting most of the ocean, with the exception of polar and subpolar waters. This wide distribution is associated with a remarkable plasticity in ecological and behavioural habits, which makes it difficult to model and predict its distribution. This study proposes a ‘multi-type approach’ to predict the presence and distribution of the bottlenose dolphin in the Pelagos Sanctuary, a Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance located in the north-west Mediterranean Sea. A multi-type model based on random forest regression was developed, analysing the distribution habits of two geographical units living in the Pelagos area. When compared with a classical single-type model, the multi-type model performed much better in a prediction test (true skill statistics, TSS = 85% vs. 52%), confirming the value of this experimental approach. This work suggests that wild species should not be considered as one single-type entity, as local specialization may change and shape their distribution habits. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins make many different sounds that have been recorded and described by researchers for over 60 years. This species, Tursiops truncatus, is arguably the most studied marine mammal. They have the ability to hear and produce sounds over a range of at least 150 kilohertz (kHz). Although the human hearing is limited in bandwidth to less than 20 kHz, dolphin sounds have historically been described as humans perceive them (e.g. whistles, squeals, buzzes, barks, quacks, pops, etc.). Often the same names have been used for different sounds and different names have been used for sounds that are apparently the same. In this review, we try and summarize the dolphin sound literature and provide standardized spectrograms where possible. Our goal is to provide a foundation for future research to build upon by providing a tool for identifying whether a sound has been described before. Novel sound types can then be recognized. Also, we encourage future studies that show when dolphins perceive two sound types as different. Detailed reports linking sound and behaviour are also essential. Only then can we have a complete idea of the dolphin repertoire and begin to understand how they use sound for communication. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: There is increasing evidence that animal personality can affect many aspects of an individual's behaviour, life history and fitness. However, there have been few studies about the link between personality and social organization in the context of wild mammals in their own natural environments. This article reports on ecologically relevant data, linking experimental data from the wild to long-term social association data in a socially and cognitively complex mammal species (bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus). Here, I used behavioural data to describe personality differences between bottlenose dolphins and social network analysis to assess the relationship between personality and social structure. First, I measured the reaction of photo-identified individuals over time and across contexts as a trade-off between a novelty-seeking behaviour (boldness) and a novelty-averse behaviour (shyness). Second, I applied social network analysis to understand the link between the observed shy–bold continuum and social organization, while controlling for other factors that could contribute to affiliation. This study presents for the first time consistent individual differences in behavioural response to novelty, as a proxy for the shy–bold continuum, in wild bottlenose dolphins. Bold individuals had a central role in the social network with stronger associations than shy individuals, suggesting that bold individuals may play an important role in group cohesion, group stability and the spread of information through the network. Together, these findings provide insights into how a social network is structured by personality in wild bottlenose dolphins, with potential fitness consequences. Furthermore, this study provides additional evidence of the existence of social personalities in nonhuman animals and contributes to the understanding of the role of personality in determining the extent to which mammals associate with others. © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Based on optimal foraging theory, animals are expected to maximize foraging benefits whilst minimizing risks. Despite risking being subjected to anthropogenic impacts such as water contamination, marine traffic, and underwater noise, estuaries have been identified as the preferred habitat of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis, IPHD). However, it remains unclear why this vulnerable species favours such risky habitats. Here, an exploratory case study in Zhanjiang estuary, China, was conducted to test the hypothesis that IPHDs select estuarine habitats as a trade-off that maximizes foraging opportunities whilst minimizing the risk of mortality. The results showed that IPHDs accept greater mortality risks for higher food rewards but select habitats with lower risks when food rewards are similar between two locations. Although this type of information is important for underpinning models for individual dolphins, its principal role is to show environmental protection agencies why IPHDs favour estuaries despite the increased mortality risks. Habitat conservation plans should carefully consider prey stocks, possibly through the presence of marine protected areas near estuaries, as local overfishing may lead vulnerable cetacean populations to take greater risks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Human-animal interactions with mutual benefits in the wild are rare. Such positive interactions seem to require an intricate knowledge from the human side on the animals' behavior and their habitat. In southern Brazil, dolphins and human net-casting fishers have specialized in a cooperative foraging, in which fishers report being able to identify and name dolphins. Here, we evaluate the consensus in their ability to recognize the individual dolphins they interact with. By investigating the reliability of this recognition process, we assess the pros and cons of relying on the fishers' traditional knowledge to further understand the behavior and ecology of dolphins at the individual level. We also assess the potential role of traditional knowledge for the maintenance of this unusual interaction. Methods: We interviewed 38 fishers using a semi-structured questionnaire. During each interview, we evaluate their recognition ability of dolphins by showing high-quality photos of dorsal fins of different dolphins, asking questions about the dolphins' behavior and traits, and about how fishers recognize each dolphin. We also evaluated information about the fishers. Different indices were used to measure the fishers' ability to recognize dolphins via photos, and their consensus on individual identification. These indices were modeled as functions of traits of both dolphins and fishers to investigate which ones influence the recognition process. Results: We found that fishers can primarily recognize dolphins by natural marks in the dorsal fin but there was little consensus in recognition. Fishers also tend to repeat the name of the most "popular" dolphins for different photos, indicating low reliability in individual recognition. We also found that fishers who learned from relatives (vertical learning) how to interact with dolphins tend to be more accurate and have higher consensus in dolphin recognition than those fishers who learned from friends (horizontal learning) or individually. Conclusion: Artisanal fishers have a deep understanding of the dolphins and the system they are inserted in. However, the lack of consensus in identifying individual dolphins herein reported indicates that using their traditional knowledge to further understand dolphin behavior and ecology at the individual level requires caution. Our study also suggests that the transmission of this tradition from parents to sons can be crucial to preserve such a unique human-animal positive interaction in its original form. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is considered the most threatened cetacean in the South Western Atlantic due to bycatch in gillnet fisheries of Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. As gillnet fisheries operate in the same areas inhabited by dolphins, methods and strategies to reduce bycatch require particular attention. This study investigated the potential of switching gillnets to bottom longlines to reduce franciscana bycatch rates while maintaining economic returns in a small-scale artisanal fishery in Argentina. Trials were conducted in Bahía Samborombón and Cabo San Antonio between October 2004 and January 2007, in cooperation with artisanal fishermen who simultaneously fished using bottom longlines and gillnets. Target and non-target catch composition, fishing yield, catch size distribution and quality of catch, as well as bycatch of dolphins, sea turtles, and interaction with sea lions were compared between the two fishing methods to assess the profitability of switching fishing gears. Hauls of both gear types deployed simultaneously in the same locations showed similar fish catch composition and catch size with both gears but reduced catch of juvenile fishes in longlines. Bycatch of franciscana in bottom longlines was limited to only one dolphin in three consecutive years of trials, and no direct interaction between turtles and hooks were recorded. The economic analysis showed financially acceptable perspectives under a 5-year scenario. Reducing gillnet effort by switching to bottom longlines appears a practical approach to creating a sustainable fishery that could result in significant mitigation of current bycatch of franciscana dolphins in Argentina. However, implementation requires acceptance and compliance by the artisanal gillnet fishery. © Copyright © 2020 Berninsone, Bordino, Gnecco, Foutel, Mackay and Werner.

ABSTRACT: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are intelligent machines that have been widely studied in recent years. The safety of USVs' activities is a priority issue in their applications; one effective method is to delimit an exclusive safety domain around the USV. Besides considering collision avoidance, the safety domain should satisfy the requirements of encounter situations in the COLREGs (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea) as well. Whereas the model providing the safety domain for the USVs is defined through the experience of the manned ships, a specific model for USVs has been rarely studied. A dynamic navigation safety domain (DNSD) for USVs was proposed in this paper. To construct the model, the essential factors that could affect the navigation safety of the USVs were extracted via a rough set, and the extension functions of these factors were carried out. The DNSD was employed in various situations and compared with the ship domain models of common ships. It was found that the domain boundary can be automatically corrected according to the change in the working conditions when the DNSD is in use. Compared with the Fujii and Coldwell models, the DNSD can provide a larger safety area for a USV's action of collision avoidance. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive success is vital in sustaining free-ranging and managed bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) populations. Ultrasonography is an invaluable, non-invasive tool in assessing the fetomaternal unit in humans and animals, including dolphins and horses. The purpose of this prospective longitudinal cohort study was to develop a protocol for fetomaternal ultrasonographic monitoring in dolphins and to report normal measurements and descriptive findings correlated with a positive outcome. From 2010 to 2017, serial ultrasonographic evaluations of 12 healthy dolphins were performed over the course of 16 pregnancies. A total of 203 ultrasound examinations were included in the study. Several metrics were accurate in predicting fetal age. Fetal biparietal diameter (BPD), thoracic width in dorsal and transverse planes, thoracic height in a sagittal plane, aortic diameter, and blubber thickness all demonstrated high correlation with gestational age (r > 0.94, P <.00001). Regional uteroplacental thickness significantly increased with each trimester (range 0.22–0.40 cm; P <.00011 cranial uterus, P <.00057 mid, and P <.000011 caudal). Lung:liver mean pixel intensity was 2.57 ± 0.46 (95% confidence interval 2.47-2.67). Ultrasonographic characteristics of normal pregnancy in dolphins are described and an equation for prediction of parturition date in Tursiops is reported: days to parturition = 348.16 − (26.03 × BPD(cm)) (R2= 0.99). Future applications of these normal data will help identify in utero abnormalities indicative of fetal morbidity, and improve understanding of reproductive failure in wild and managed populations. © 2020 National Marine Mammal Foundation.

ABSTRACT: The bottlenose dolphin, genus Tursiops, is cosmopolitan occurring in tropical and temperate regions, with morphological variation between and within different oceans. Since the genus' taxonomy has been under discussion for a long time, this work aimed at analyzing the cranial variability of T. truncatus from different regions of the world. Geometric Morphometrics analyses were performed in 201 skulls of adult specimens, on dorsal, ventral, and lateral views, from the Eastern North Pacific, Eastern North Atlantic, Eastern South Atlantic, and Western South Atlantic oceans. The results indicate differences between individuals that inhabit the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Within the Atlantic Ocean, there is an evident longitudinal differentiation of specimens from the eastern and western regions. A latitudinal separation was also observed, considering specimens from the North and South Atlantic Ocean. In the Western South Atlantic statistical differences were found between two morphological groups, identified as T. gephyreus (sensu Lahille, 1908) and T. truncatus, and the cross-validation presented 98% as minimum confidence for correct classification of these two groups. The present study provides strong morphological support to consider these two lineages as separate species. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Fisheries bycatch is a primary driver of cetacean declines, especially for threatened freshwater cetaceans. However, information on the factors influencing cetacean susceptibility to bycatch in small-scale fisheries is limited, impeding development of evidence-based conservation strategies. We conducted 663 interviews with fishers from southern Bangladesh to investigate the influence of net and set characteristics on seasonal bycatch rates of Ganges River dolphins Platanista gangetica gangetica and assess the sustainability of annual mortality levels. Between October 2010–October 2011, 170 bycatch events (and a minimum of 14 mortalities) were reported, 89% of which occurred in gillnets. The probability of bycatch increased as water depth declined, and as net mesh size increased. While the number of recorded bycatch incidents was higher in gillnets, risk of mortality was greater in set bagnets. Our mortality estimate indicates that fisheries-related bycatch currently exceeds the sustainable limit recommended by the International Whaling Commission by 3.5 times. Numerous regulations have been developed to improve the productivity of commercially important fisheries, and if regulations were effectively enforced, these may also reduce river dolphin bycatch. © 2019 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Cognitive enrichment aims to provide animals with opportunities to use their cognitive skills and to promote behaviors associated with positive wellbeing. Cooperation in mammals has been recorded during various behavioral contexts such as hunting, mating, playing, and parental care. Coordinated activity, often with some level of problem-solving action included, is required during cooperation. To investigate dolphins’ ability for collaborative problem-solving, an enrichment device was introduced to two adult male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). The device contained fish and ice and was designed to be opened by simultaneously pulling on both ends. After repeated presentation, it became apparent that only one dolphin had active interest in the device. To facilitate opportunities for problem-solving by this individual, an alternative collaborator, a human partner, was provided. Still, both dolphins had access to the device throughout the entire experiment. After the first opening, the same dolphin was highly successful in collaborating with the human in both joined (93%) and delayed (100%) partner conditions. The device provided a novel opportunity for the dolphin to use his cognitive skills. Even though only one dolphin participated actively, both dolphins showed varying degrees of interest to the device throughout the study. Both dolphins spent an average of 48% and 16% of their time, respectively, with the device, which resulted in a significant decrease in their other two most frequently observed behaviors: swimming and poolside observation. As a novel cognitive challenge, the device may be considered as a type of cognitive enrichment. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) can become entangled in fishing line and other marine debris. Infrequently, dolphins can be successfully disentangled, released back into the wild, and later examined postmortem to better understand the pathology and long-term effects of these entanglements. Case presentation: An entangled common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) calf was observed in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, USA, with monofilament fishing line wrapped tightly around its maxilla. A multi-agency team successfully disentangled the dolphin for immediate release back into its natural habitat. A year after disentanglement, photos and observations indicated that the now independent calf showed a decline in body condition, characterized by grossly visible ribs and a prominent post-nuchal depression. More than 2 years post-disentanglement, the freshly dead carcass of this juvenile dolphin was recovered with extensive predation wounds. Despite the forestomach being ~ 50% full of ingesta (fish), the dolphin was emaciated. During postmortem examination, we collected and evaluated photographs and measurements of the maxillary damage resulting from the entanglement. Conclusion: The monofilament entanglement caused permanent, bilateral deformation of the maxillary dental arcade, including a 4.0-4.2 cm long, 0.5 cm deep linear groove where the entanglement eroded the lateral edges of the maxilla. There was no evidence of maxillary fracture and the dolphin survived for more than 2 years after disentanglement. External evidence of propeller scars and a fishing hook discovered embedded in the laryngeal mucosa at necropsy indicated repeated human interactions.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Due to their sensitivity and dramatic declines, freshwater mussels are prime targets for conservation and environmental monitoring. For this, however, information is needed on life history and ecological traits, which is lacking in many taxa, including threatened species. Species recently described or recognized as valid are of particular concern, due to the shortage of even basic knowledge. A case in point is the recently recognized and Near Threatened dolphin freshwater mussel Unio delphinus Spengler, 1793, which is endemic to the western Iberian Peninsula and has suffered marked population declines. To overcome information gaps for U. delphinus, we carried out a holistic biological study across the species range, aiming to: i) estimate the area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) based on updated distribution data taken from the literature and recent surveys; ii) estimate growth patterns from biometrical (shell dimensions and growth annuli) measurements taken on specimens from seven populations; iii) estimate sex ratios from gonad tissue biopsies collected on specimens from eight populations; iv) estimate gametogenesis and sex ratio through histological examination of gonad and gill tissues collected monthly for a year, from a single population; and v) determine host species from infestation trials of glochidia with co-occurring fish species. We estimated an EOO of 706 km2 and an AOO of 61 km2, which together with data on declines assigns the species to the Endangered category using IUCN criteria. Unio delphinus was found to grow faster and to be shorter-lived (up to 11 years, maturity at around 2 years old) than other European freshwater mussels. Growth and life span are similar across the range in lotic habitats, but different from that in lentic habitats. The larvae of U. delphinus may attach to most co-occurring fish species, but only native species were effective hosts. Native cyprinids, especially those from the genus Squalius, seem to be the primary hosts. Overall, the information provided contributes to a better conservation status assessment, selection of conservation and rehabilitation areas, guidance for the establishment of propagation programs and better timing for specimens’ manipulation including monitoring and possible translocations. The framework presented here highlights the importance of basic biological studies to define good ecological and physiological status. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Population structure studies play an increasingly integral role in conservation and management of marine mammal species. Genetic markers are commonly used; however, ecological markers (i.e. chemical compounds) are a fairly recent and useful tool to investigate ecological management units. The objective of this study is to investigate the population structure of the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) within its distribution in the Atlantic Ocean using data from stable isotopes of δ13C and δ15N and persistent organic pollutants as ecological markers. Based on previous studies that addressed distribution, morphometric analyses and molecular and ecological markers, we hypothesize that there are several ecological management units within the Atlantic Ocean. Our results confirmed population differentiation previously detected using genetic markers. Additionally, dolphins from the south-eastern coast of Brazil do not show complete ecological segregation from the Caribbean ones, while molecular analyses suggested genetic differentiation between the two regions. In the light of these results, we propose that at least two ecological management units should be considered, east and west of the Atlantic Ocean; however, the presence of one or two management units along the Atlantic coast of Central and South America needs further investigation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Diet analysis allows exploring how coastal dolphins interact with the environment and their role in the marine food webs. We studied the diet and feeding ecology of the Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, through analysis of stomach content from 42 animals stranded on the eastern coast of Brazil. A total of 1,336 semidigested prey items (fish, otoliths, cephalopod beaks, and crustaceans) were identified. Teleost fish comprised the most frequent food item (92% of the total), followed by cephalopods, and crustaceans. Prey belonged to 34 taxa and richness in individual stomachs varied from 1 to 15 prey taxa. Prey were generally small, but showed a significant trend to increase in size with dolphin length. The main prey of Guiana dolphins were demersal, estuarine, and sound-making fish such as catfish and sciaenids. No sex-related differences in diet were found. Diet composition varied seasonally and occurrence of prey items was coherent with breeding or high abundance periods of some fish species and squids. Our study shows the importance of demersal prey from estuarine and soft-sediment habitats to Guiana dolphin in the Abrolhos Bank and reveals that feeding habits are generalist and opportunistic, with diet reflecting the seasonal abundance and availability of prey. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: A freshly dead juvenile bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), recovered from the waters near Sand Key, Clearwater, FL, was imaged postmortem using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging prior to conventional necropsy. The pattern of imaging findings in the brain was compatible with severe multifocal meningoencephalitis with intralesional necrosis and/or hemorrhage, and the pattern of imaging findings in the lungs was compatible with severe multifocal bronchopneumonia. The subsequent investigation included necropsy, histology, culture, and molecular diagnostics and demonstrated disseminated coinfection of dolphin morbillivirus and Aspergillus fumigatus. This is the first report documenting the cross-sectional imaging findings of this important cetacean comorbidity and demonstrates advances in modern, cooperative investigations of marine mammal mortality events. © 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Spinner dolphins Stenella longirostris longirostris in Hawai'i exhibit a predictable diurnal behavioral pattern which makes them vulnerable to human disturbance: Feeding at night in offshore waters and resting during daytime in bays. There is concern that human activity, such as swimming with and viewing wild dolphins from vessels, is altering their natural behavioral patterns and preventing them from having adequate rest. In light of this, state and federal management agencies are proposing enhanced protection measures. Research on spinner dolphins has largely focused off Hawai'i Island and there are insufficient data from Maui Nui (Maui, Lana'i, Kaho'olawe, and Moloka'i) to inform appropriate management measures for the genetically distinct stock that resides around these islands. Using location data from 316 encounters between 1996 and 2019, we identified 2 hotspots for spinner dolphins within the region, located along west Maui and south Lana'i. The predominant behavior observed was traveling, and there was little resting behavior documented throughout the study period, with no resting behavior observed along the coastline of Maui. Our findings revealed that spinner dolphins use a wide variety of available habitat in Maui Nui and were observed resting both near the shore of Lana'i and in the channels between islands. Based upon these findings, the proposed lone area for closure in south Maui is inadequate for providing protection to spinner dolphins during resting hours, and we propose that the identified hotspots be considered as additional sites for closures, in addition to an approach limit for vessels transiting Maui Nui. © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Odontocetes are considered ideal sentinel species to monitor environmental trace element concentrations. Although frozen tissues are preferable for trace element analysis, formalin-fixed tissues are often the only samples available; however, it is uncertain whether formalin fixation alters tissue trace element concentrations. To explore whether formalin-fixed tissues could be utilized for toxicology studies, concentrations of 14 trace elements (arsenic [As], cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, selenium, tin, vanadium, and zinc [Zn]) were measured in frozen and formalin-fixed bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) tissues following short-term (6 wk; tissues: blubber, liver, and lung) and long-term preservation (3–7 yr; tissues: blubber, brain, kidney, liver, lung, and skin) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Following both short-term and long-term preservation, there were significant differences in tissue trace element concentrations between preservation methods. Some trace elements were found in greater concentrations in frozen tissues compared with formalin-fixed tissues, suggesting leaching (e.g., mean As concentrations were between 1.4 and 7.6 times greater in frozen tissues). In contrast, other trace elements were found in greater concentrations in formalin-fixed tissues compared with frozen tissues, suggesting contamination (e.g., mean Zn concentrations were up to 8.7 times higher in some formalin-fixed tissues). Our results suggest that it may be possible to account for the effects of formalin fixation for some trace elements, but leaching and contamination should be carefully considered.

ABSTRACT: Age composition is an important population parameter for understanding and managing endangered species. There are very few studies involving cetaceans in estimating the age of individuals in the wild. In this study, we rigorously quantified the body color pattern of 37 stranded Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), which showed a significant, albeit with variability between individuals, correlation with age for both the males (between age 1 and 35, r2 = 0.84) and females (between age 1 and 25, r2 = 0.85). The population-averaged correlation (r2 = 0.85) was then applied to a large volume of photo-identification data (2011–2015) to estimate the age composition of the population occurring in the greater deltaic region, which further suggested a spatial difference in age composition and, therefore, a complex demographic process of the humpback dolphin across the region. In particular, the age composition of humpback dolphins in the east PRE (Lingding Bay) is severely aged. Finally, a population viability analysis with the consideration of observed age structure and the simulated age-specific fecundity suggested that 95.75% of the Lingding Bay humpback dolphins are projected to be lost after three generations. Given the sophisticated anthropogenic landscape in the PRE, we suggest that management units of the humpback dolphins should be clearly defined and the regional-specific conservation measures are much needed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This study focuses on the dolphins populating the water between Gibraltar and Algeciras in the south Iberian Peninsula, an area subjected to pressure due to high human activity. The area is considered an important feeding and breeding ground for common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). Due to the degree of residence of some specimens, and the large gap in knowledge about the evolution of wounds in D. delphis specimens with lacerations, this work sought to perform the following analyses: identify lacerated individuals; characterize sequences of 'before - during - after' with respect to the occurrence of lacerations; and associate the type of injury with its severity. This work will inform future studies by expanding a database on injured individuals and contribute to periodical monitoring of specimens that frequent these geographic areas. Between 2013 and 2017, we were able to track the healing process of five injured individuals of common dolphins from a whale-watching platform thanks to photo identification. The animals exhibited fresh external wounds from different sources. In the majority of individuals, the wound-healing processes lasted 3-21 weeks. The frequency with which sightings are made and knowledge about the local population will help track injured animals, follow their wound evolution, and document their survival rates. The documented injuries inflicted by human interactions described in this paper may include fishing interactions and propeller strikes, probably as a consequence of the high intensity of recreational fishing and whale-watching activities in the area.

ABSTRACT: Globally, the exploitation of marine mammals has shifted from hunting to viewing over the last few decades. While refraining from actively killing animals may have a positive effect on marine mammal populations, whale and dolphin watching can induce changes such as displacement from preferred habitat and disruption of foraging that may also have severe fitness costs. Under some circumstances, this non-lethal disturbance may affect populations in a manner similar to directed mortality. Here, we focus on inshore dolphin populations that are known to show short-term behavioral responses to boat approaches. Long-term fitness effects have only been clearly identified in a small number of these populations, and all share certain characteristics, i.e., closed, small and food-limited. This raises the question of importance of context when considering the long-term effects of disturbance, since many dolphin populations may be open, large, and/or free from resource restriction. We explored the effect of disturbance based on the characteristics of populations using the population consequences of disturbance (PCoD) framework. PCoD was developed to link short-term changes in individual behavior and physiology to presumed long-term effects on population dynamics. To ensure our scenarios were biologically plausible, they reflected the ecological context of four well-studied populations of dolphins, Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, Sarasota Bay, United States, Durban Bay, South Africa, and Jervis Bay, Australia, in terms of their size, closure, and food resources. We found that the characteristics of the populations being disturbed are important with regards to the level of disturbance that could be tolerated. Closed populations were most sensitive, while large, open populations with no food limitation appeared to be able to withstand a higher probability of disturbance. This implies that population characteristics should be accounted for when determining the suitability of whale and dolphin watching operations in a given area. © Copyright © 2020 New, Lusseau and Harcourt.

ABSTRACT: Titanium (Ti), used in many dailyuse products, such as shampoos and sunscreen filters, in the form of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), may elicit adverse marine biota effects. Marine mammal Ti data is scarce, and subcellular distribution and detoxification information is non-existent. Ti concentrations and metalloprotein detoxification in Pontoporia blainvillei and Steno bredanensis dolphins from Southeastern Brazil were assessed. Metallothionein (MT) concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, total and subcellular Ti, by ICP-MS and detoxification, by HPLC-ICP-MS. Ti detoxification occurred through MT complexation. Statistical Ti-MT associations were observed in S. bredanensis liver, indicating TiO2 NPs contamination, as Ti binds to MT only as NPs. MT-Ti correlations were observed for both the coastal (P. blainvillei) and offshore (S. bredanensis) dolphins, evidencing oceanic TiO2 diffusion. Ti detoxification through binding to reduced glutathione occurred in both species. Thermostable subcellular fractions are a valuable tool for cetacean Ti detoxification assessments and should be applied to conservation efforts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We investigated the short-term effects of non-targeted tourism on the behaviour of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in the South Adriatic off the coast of Montenegro, by comparing dolphin group behaviour during impact (the presence of non-targeted tourism vessels) and control (absence of all marine vessels) scenarios. Tourism vessel and dolphin behavioural data were collected through systematic weekly land-based surveys. Using instantaneous focal 'group' scan sampling, the predominant behaviour of bottlenose dolphin groups was determined. To quantify the effect of vessel interactions on the behavioural budget of the dolphins, we followed a stepwise modelling approach. A first-order Markov chain was used to calculate the transition probabilities between behavioural states before a Monte Carlo simulation estimated the behavioural budgets of dolphins during impact and control situations. In the presence of non-targeted tourism, dolphins were found to be less likely to remain diving (during which dolphins were assumed to be feeding), whilst milling-socialising and surface feeding were completely absent from their behavioural repertoires. Nevertheless, the behavioural budgets demonstrated an increase in resting behaviour in the presence of non-targeted tourism vessels. No significant changes to travelling behaviour were observed. The decrease in foraging behaviour (both surface feeding and diving) could result in a reduction in energy intake for dolphins, which over time (assuming repeated disturbance) could negatively affect body condition, and ultimately survival and reproduction. Regulations on non-targeted tourism should therefore be considered to minimise potential long-term negative effects on dolphins within Montenegrin territorial waters. © Inter-Research 2020.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins and other cetaceans (marine mammals) have seen a surge of environmental advocacy in the decade since The Cove (2009) emerged. Drawing upon Western popular culture texts such as the popular film and television series, Flipper (1963), The Cove seeks to flip or reframe our cultural understanding of dolphins from friends to victims in need of help. In this essay, I argue that The Cove is an exemplar eco-doc that employs an intertextual dialogue to facilitate a multi-media outreach campaign that changed public perception of dolphins and lead to dolphin advocacy efforts. By analyzing how The Cove incorporates and challenges the interspecies friendship trope and then investigating the ways the film and outreach integrate aspects of the action-thriller plot, I demonstrate how intertextuality facilitates a revised, urgent advocacy message designed to raise awareness and generate action to stop dolphin over-exploitation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Photo analysis offers a simple, noninvasive approach to characterizing and quantifying skin lesions in cetaceans; however, this process involves methodological considerations that have often gone unaddressed or have varied in approach among investigators. Subjectivity associated with classifying skin lesion types of unknown etiology and quantifying measures of skin lesion prevalence and extent from photo data raises questions about observer bias and agreement (i.e., interrater reliability), which are often ignored. The purpose of the present study was to improve upon data quality control and assessment practices when studying skin lesions using only photo data. Specifically, we tested interrater reliability of a skin lesion classification system, compared methods of quantifying skin lesion extent, and determined the validity of the dorsal fin as a proxy for skin lesions on the entire body. Acceptable levels of interrater reliability were achieved for only 7 of 17 defined lesion types, but reliability was high for the two tested measures of lesion extent. Skin lesion extent measured from the dorsal fin alone was not a decent proxy for the whole visible surface; disparities between measures were as high as 43%. We discuss the potential pitfalls discovered and provide recommendations for others attempting similar approaches. © 2020 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) dolphins are primarily exposed to chlorinated organic contaminants through the consumption of contaminated fish. We assessed the potential risk of chlorinated organic contaminants to Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins by determining the concentration of 21 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and 28 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in 14 fish species collected from the South China Sea coastal waters. The results of the study showed that bioaccumulation of OCPs and PCBs was influenced by sampling location, fish species, and fish niche. The average ∑DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) concentration was 3 times higher in benthopelagic fish (488 ng/g) compared to pelagic-neritic fish (155 ng/g) from Jiangmen, whereas an opposite pattern of the lower DDTs concentration in benthopelagic and demersal fish compared to pelagic fish from Zhuhai (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the molecular diagnostic ratios using DDT and its metabolites (DDT/(DDD + DDE) were less than one, suggesting the DDT contamination at Zhuhai and Jiangmen may due to the historical agricultural usage of the lands. The reference dose-based (RfD) risk quotient (RQ) suggested that DDTs are potential risk in Qinzhou, which is in accordance with the high DDTs concentration found in fishes captured in Qinzhou. The RfD risk quotient of PCBs is at potential risk for all sites (RQ > 100), except Xiamen and Qinzhou. A highest average ∑DDT concentration was observed Qinzhou. This study showed that fish consumption might pose a health risk to Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. However, further studies are required to determine the contribution of fish niche to the overall risk. © 2020

ABSTRACT: Peracute underwater entrapment (PUE) is a recognized cause of death associated with anthropogenic trauma in marine mammals. We describe internal lesions likely resulting from extreme agonal exertion in bottlenose dolphins due to entanglement and forced submergence in fishing gear during PUE. We reviewed necropsy findings from bottlenose dolphins with known PUE statuses in Virginia, United States from 2016–2019 (n = 31) for the presence of five lesions: pulmonary petechiae, pulmonary perivascular edema, hemorrhagic pulmonary lymph, separation of the rectus abdominis muscles, and acute abdominal hernias. Of the 31 cases, 23 were considered PUE cases due to the presence of external ligature marks consistent with entanglement in fishing gear. Of the animals examined, pulmonary perivascular edema, pulmonary petechiae, and hemorrhagic pulmonary lymph were found in both PUE and non-PUE cases. Though found in one non-PUE case, pulmonary perivascular edema was significantly related to PUE. There was no significant relationship between PUE and pulmonary petechiae or hemorrhagic pulmonary lymph. Rectus abdominis muscle separations and acute abdominal hernias were only found in PUE cases and nine animals exhibited either one (n = 7) or both (n = 2) of these traumatic lesions. Although these two lesions were relatively rare, there was a statistically significant relationship between the presence of one or both of the lesions and positive PUE status. This study suggests that pulmonary perivascular edema, acute hernias and separations of the rectus abdominis muscles may be useful for diagnosing PUE in the absence of external fishery interaction lesions, and highlights the severity of agonal fisheries interactions. © Copyright © 2020 Epple, Daniel, Barco, Rotstein and Costidis.

ABSTRACT: Aim: The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is an endangered cetacean found throughout Southeast Asia. The main threat to this species is human encroachment, led by entanglement in fishing gear. Information on this data-poor species’ ecology and habitat use is needed to effectively inform spatial management. Location: We investigated the habitat of a previously unstudied group of Irrawaddy dolphins in the eastern Gulf of Thailand, between the villages of Laem Klat and Khlong Yai, in Trat Province. This location is important as government groups plan to establish a marine protected area. Methods: We carried out boat-based visual line transect surveys with concurrent oceanographic measurements and used hurdle models to evaluate this species’ patterns of habitat use in this area. Results: Depth most strongly predicted dolphin presence, while temperature was a strong predictor of group size. The highest probability of dolphin presence occurred at around 10.0 m with an optimal depth range of 7.50 to 13.05 m. The greatest number of dolphins was predicted at 24.93°C with an optimal range between 24.93 and 25.31°C. Dolphins are most likely to occur in two primary locations, one large region in the center of the study area (11o54′18′′N to 11o59′23′′N) and a smaller region in the south (11o47′28′′N to 11o49′59′′N). Protections for this population will likely have the greatest chance of success in these two areas. Main Conclusions: The results of this work can inform management strategies within the immediate study area by highlighting areas of high habitat use that should be considered for marine spatial planning measures, such as the creation of marine protected areas. Species distribution models for this species in Thailand can also assist conservation planning in other parts of the species’ range by expanding our understanding of habitat preferences. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Varying levels of population structure may arise from interactions between intrinsic behavioral and demographic factors and extrinsic environmental factors. Social organization, habitat use, resource partitioning, or even individual preferences are putative drivers of population genetic differentiation over fine spatial scales. Here, genome-wide data from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data were used to examine population structure and niche partitioning among three social units of bottlenose dolphins with strong home range overlap in a relatively small geographic area in southern Brazil. Results from model-based and model-free analyses of population structure supported the delineation of two populations, one with preferences for estuarine waters and another strictly coastal, consistent with isotopic niche differentiation. These findings suggest that genetic and ecological structuring is mainly driven by habitat use. At finer scale, we also detected low but significant genetic differentiation among the three social units. The outcomes of this study provide new insights into population structure of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins in the Patos Lagoon estuary and its adjacent coastal waters, which are exposed to increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbances, such as intensive artisanal fisheries, pollution, and boat traffic. Although for demographic studies, the estuary and the coastal dolphins should be treated separately, for conservation purposes, we recommend that the three social units be regarded as different entities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We report the pathological features of a facial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and an abdominal peripheral nerve sheath tumour (PNST) with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation in an aged free-ranging rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis). The animal was found stranded dead in poor body condition. On external examination, there was a 25 × 7 × 3 cm extensively ulcerated area on the right maxillary region of the rostrum, involving the oral mucocutaneous junction with prominent nodular edges, severe soft tissue loss and extensive maxillary and premaxillary bone lysis. On abdominal dissection, a 5 × 4 × 3.5 cm pale tan to red, raised mass expanded the inner aspect of the right transverse abdominis muscle. Microscopically, the aggressive facial lesion was an acantholytic SCC with extensive osteolysis; there was no evidence of metastasis in the tissues examined. The abdominal mass had cytohistomorphological features compatible with a localized PNST, including whorling, Antoni A and Antoni B areas and Verocay bodies intermixed with rhabdomyoblastic components, as suggested by phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin stain. This neoplasm was locally infiltrative, yet no metastases were observed in the tissues examined. No immunohistochemical investigations could be performed due to lack of tissue availability. Total DNA from the formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded SCC was extracted and tested by polymerase chain reaction for herpesvirus and papillomavirus genetic material. There was no amplification for either of these genera. Other pathological findings observed in this animal were related to the ‘live-stranding stress response’. The severity and extent of the facial SCC likely related to anorexia and poor body condition and might have played a role in the stranding and death of this dolphin. These two tumour subtypes add to the relatively uncommon reports of neoplasia in cetaceans. Specifically, these appear to be the first neoplasia records for rough-toothed dolphins, including the first documentation of a PNST with features compatible with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation in a marine mammal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In dolphins, centrum shape is one of the features that allows determination of stable and flexible regions in the vertebral column. The Commerson's (Cephalorhynchus commersonii; n = 37), Peale's (Lagenorhynchus australis; n = 24), dusky (Lagenorhynchus obscurus; n = 29), and hourglass dolphins (Lagenorhynchus cruciger; n = 10) are closely related species inhabiting the Southern Hemisphere that have diverse prey and habitat preferences. We applied 3D geometric morphometrics to describe differences in centrum shape along the vertebral columns of these species, and hypothesize how these differences may affect swimming. On each column, we chose a maximum of eight vertebrae and digitized 18 landmarks on each centrum with a Microscribe G2X. We explored shape differences amongst regions employing principal components analyses and computing Mahalanobis distances. We describe differences in centrum shape in relation to functional regions and among species; and analyze shape changes in relation to particular biomechanical requirements. The species studied here may be partially sympatric in the Southern Hemisphere, but they have important differences in foraging ecology and habitat preferences that could be related to differences in centrum shape along the vertebral column. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Synchronous displays are hallmarks of many animal societies, ranging from the pulsing flashes of fireflies, to military marching in humans. Such displays are known to facilitate mate attraction or signal relationship quality. Across many taxa, synchronous male displays appear to be driven by competition, while synchronous displays in humans are thought to be unique in that they serve a cooperative function. Indeed, it is well established that human synchrony promotes cooperative endeavours and increases success in joint action tasks. We examine another system in which synchrony is tightly linked to cooperative behaviour. Male bottlenose dolphins form long-lasting, multi-level, cooperative alliances in which they engage in coordinated efforts to coerce single oestrus females. Previous work has revealed the importance of motor synchrony in dolphin alliance behaviour. Here, we demonstrate that allied dolphins also engage in acoustic coordination whereby males will actively match the tempo and, in some cases, synchronize the production of their threat vocalization when coercing females. This finding demonstrates that male dolphins are capable of acoustic coordination in a cooperative context and, moreover, suggests that both motor and acoustic coordination are features of coalitionary behaviour that are not limited to humans. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, is a small cetacean species found on the Atlantic coast of Central and South America from Honduras to Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The nematode Halocercus brasiliensis infects this cetacean, resulting in lung pathologies and death. The present study aimed to conduct a morphological and morphometric study of specimens of H. brasiliensis collected from S. guianensis from the coast of the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. For this study, 7 dolphins were collected and examined for the presence of lung parasites. Nematodes were collected and processed for light microscopy, and lung fragments were processed for histological analysis. The nematodes were identified as H. brasiliensis according to their morphology and morphometry. The histopathological analysis revealed mineralization of the bronchiolar cartilage and inflammatory process. The parasitic infections by H. brasiliensis in S. guianensis can contribute to the debilitating status of these cetaceans, resulting in their stranding and accidental capture in fishing nets. © American Society of Parasitologists 2020.

ABSTRACT: The striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) is one of the most abundant cetaceans of the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless, it is ranked as ‘Vulnerable’ by IUCN Red List experts. To implement conservation strategies within the Mediterranean Sea, it is crucial to understand how striped dolphins are distributed at different geographical scales. The present study investigates its distribution within the EU Adriatic and Ionian Sea Region. To model striped dolphin distribution, topographic (distance from shore, depth and slope) and oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature and phytoplankton concentration) were employed, and species distribution models (SDMs) were developed using Maxent software. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to improve the information supplied by the SDMs, allowing the description of response curves to striped dolphin occurrences. Statistical analysis shows that striped dolphins are not evenly distributed within the investigated area. The higher encounter rates observed in the Gulf of Taranto and the Gulf of Corinth confirm that both sub-regions are crucial for its conservation. Furthermore, SDMs also indicate suitable areas in the offshore waters of the Adriatic Sea, along the continental slope of the north-eastern Ionian Sea and over its continental shelf. Within the EU Adriatic and Ionian Sea Region, striped dolphins prefer areas at a greater distance from shore, with steeper slopes, deeper waters, and higher sea surface temperature. The topographic variables are the most explicative factors for both modelling approaches. The analysis of striped dolphin SDMs allows the identification of important areas for conservation and highlights zones where appropriate mitigation strategies could reduce the impact of human activities on this Vulnerable species. Further analysis of SDMs for different periods of the year, as well as a genetic study, could highlight seasonal movements across and within sub-regions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Melioidosis is an emerging infectious disease of humans and animals caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei and endemic in tropical regions, principally Southeast Asia and northern Australia. In September 2017, after Hurricane Maria impacted the Dolphin Discovery facility in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, a juvenile male bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) died within 96 hr of presenting with acute anorexia, lethargy, and respiratory distress. Histopathology demonstrated necrohemorrhagic bronchopneumonia, necrotizing hepatitis, splenitis, and lymphadenitis, with intralesional Gram-negative bacilli. B. pseudomallei was confirmed by bacteriological culture and DNA sequencing. This case emphasizes the challenges of melioidosis diagnosis, the importance of awareness for both early detection and efficacious treatment, and recognition in tropical regions where it has been either not reported or underreported. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of cetacean melioidosis in the Caribbean Islands, an often severe and fatal disease with increasing prevalence on the American continent. © 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Photographs collected during a 23 yr photo-identification study in the Moray Firth were examined to assess the prevalence, type and severity of vertebral deformations present in bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus calves. Fifteen cases of presenting spinal anomalies (scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis and combinations thereof) of variable severity were identified in 7.4% of all known calves from the population. Thirteen of the 15 anomalies were either manifest from birth or acquired from an early age, as ascertained from longitudinal sightings histories of their mothers. Most afflicted calves died during early development or shortly after maternal separation. However, 3 survived to adulthood and persist in the population to date, in addition to 2 dependent infants whose fate remains to be established. At 15+ yr of age, the oldest surviving individual was remarkably one of the most severe cases identified, highlighting the ability of these delphinids for adaptation to such gross structural deformities. The aetiology of the observed conditions could be attributed to a range of causative factors that may have implications for the well-being and health of this North Sea coastal dolphin population, a topic which merits further investigation.  © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Providing for infants nutritionally via lactation is one of the hallmarks of mammalian reproduction, and infants without motivated mothers providing for them are unlikely to survive. Mothers must maintain regular contact with infants both spatially and temporally while utilising their environment to forage, avoid threats and find shelter. However, mothers can only do this and maximise their reproductive success with some degree of co-operation from infants, despite their developing physical and cognitive capabilities. The neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) triggers proximity-seeking behaviour and acts in a positive feedback loop across mother-infant bonds, stimulating appropriate pro-social behaviour across the pair. However, data on infant OT levels is lacking, and it is unclear how important infants are in maintaining mother-infant associations. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a mammalian species that is fully physically mobile at birth and has multi-year, but individually variable, lactation periods. We investigated OT concentrations in mother-infant pairs of wild individuals compared to other age and reproductive classes. An ELISA to detect OT in dolphin plasma was successfully validated with extracted plasma. We highlight a statistical method for testing for parallelism that could be applied to other ELISA validation studies. OT concentrations were consistently elevated in calves up to at least 4 years of age with lactating mothers (12.1 ± 0.9 pg/ml), while all mothers (4.5 ± 0.4 pg/ml) had OT concentrations comparable to non-lactating individuals (5.9 ± 0.5 pg/ml). Concentrations within infants were individually variable, and may reflect the strength of the bond with their mother. The OT system likely provides a physiological mechanism for motivating infants to perform behaviours that prevent long-term separation from their mothers during this crucial time in their life history. Elevated infant OT has also been linked to energetic and developmental advantages which may lead to greater survival rates. Environmental or anthropogenic disturbances to OT release can occur during bond formation or can disrupt the communication methods used to reinforce these bonds via OT elevation. Variation in OT expression in infants, and its behavioural and physiological consequences, may explain differences in reproductive success despite appropriate maternal behaviour expression. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The airways and lungs of vertebrates are an entrance way for several microbial pathogens. Cetaceans present an upper and lower respiratory anatomy that allows the rapid flow of large air volumes, which may lead to high susceptibility to respiratory infections. Mortality and stranding rate of Cetaceans increased dramatically, so wide the knowledge about the immune system and specific antibodies identifying immune cells populations, is of fundamental importance to monitor and document cetacean health. The aim of this study was to identify the localization of dendritic cells marked by Langerin/CD207 in airways, lungs and associated lymph nodes, of the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba. Samples of trachea, bronchi, lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes were obtained from a stranded adult male of Stenella coeruleoalba. Our results showed abundant lymphoid aggregates (LAs) in the lung of S. ceruleoalba. Langerhans-like dendritic cells were well distributed along the epithelium and interstitium of respiratory tract and in associated lymph nodes. The present study deepens the knowledge about the cetacean's immune system and report about the exploitability of a commercial antibody (Langerin/CD207) for cetacean species. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolpliins (Tursiops inmca-tus truncatus) (hereafter referred to as "dolpliins") are distributed along the east coast of Florida in a longitudinal continuum within inland waterways and federally managed via assignment into stocks. Seven regional studies have identified local estuaiine populations with resident and seasonally transient dolpliins. However, study area boundaries limit understanding of distribution and movement patterns between these geographically separated regions. To reveal the bigger picture of spatiotemporal movements, a multi-organizational consortium conducted semiannual photo-identification surveys from the Florida-Georgia border to Titusville, Florida (331 km). The study area incorporated dolpliins occurring in the Jacksonville Estuaiine System (JES) stock in the north, the Mosquito Lagoon within the Indian River Lagoon Estuaiine System (IRLES-ML) stock in the south, and the connecting 156-km inland waterway currently managed under the Western North Atlantic Northern Florida and Central Florida coastal stocks. The area was divided into segments, and simultaneous surveys were conducted from 2011 to 2016 during two primary sampling seasons within each year: five summers and five winters (primary period), with two to three surveys (secondary sessions) within each primary period separated by one-week intervals to allow mixing of the population. A total of 6,896 dolpliins. including 196 neonates, were observed, and 649 individuals were identified. Spatial autocorrelation analyses of 222 marked dolphins sighted in > 5 primary surveys revealed that 78fc exhibited significant regional and seasonal fidelity to one or more segments, which no single study could elucidate. Additionally, JES-North dolphins demonstrated strong regional site fidelity and were consistently sighted during both seasons, similar to studies in the 1990s, and continued to be partitioned from dolphins to the south. JES-Soutli and IRLES-ML dolphin home ranges extended beyond previously known boundaries. Based on spatiotem-poral movement patterns between the segments, recommendations are made to revise boundaries of the JES and IRLES stocks. © 2020 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a global marine mammal species for which some populations, due to their coastal accessibility, have been monitored diligently by scientists for decades. Health assessment examinations have developed a comprehensive knowledge base of dolphin biology, population structure, and environmental or anthropogenic stressors affecting their dynamics. Bottlenose dolphin health assessments initially started as stock assessments prior to acquisition. Over the last four decades, health assessments have evolved into essential conservation management tools of free-ranging dolphin populations. Baseline data enable comparison of stressors between geographic locations and associated changes in individual and population health status. In addition, long-term monitoring provides opportunities for insights into population shifts over time, with retrospective application of novel diagnostic tests on archived samples. Expanding scientific knowledge enables effective long-term conservation management strategies by facilitating informed decision making and improving social understanding of the anthropogenic effects. The ability to use bottlenose dolphins as a model for studying marine mammal health has been pivotal in our understanding of anthropogenic effects on multiple marine mammal species. Future studies aim to build on current knowledge to influence management decisions and species conservation. This paper reviews the historical approaches to dolphin health assessments, present day achievements, and development of future conservation goals. © Copyright © 2019 Barratclough, Wells, Schwacke, Rowles, Gomez, Fauquier, Sweeney, Townsend, Hansen, Zolman, Balmer and Smith.

ABSTRACT: Species relationships in the bottlenose dolphin (genus Tursiops Gervais, 1855) are controversial. We carried out a comprehensive osteological study of 264 skulls, including type specimens, and 90 postcranial skeletons of Tursiops spp. to address taxonomic uncertainties in Australia using two-dimensional (2D) measurements, and three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (3DGM), tooth and vertebral counts, and categorical data. Analyses provided support for the presence of two forms, aligned to the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus (Ehrenberg, 1832)) and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821)), including type specimens. The Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis Charlton-Robb, Gershwin, Thompson, Austin, Owen and McKechnie, 2011) fell well within T. truncatus for both 2D and 3DGM methods. Thirteen Tursiops spp. specimens, no T. australis specimens, were of intermediate size (2D) and could not be assigned to either species. For 3DGM data, there was a strong allometric influence and few non-allometric differences between species. Length and width of the cranium and rostrum were important discriminating variables. Tursiops aduncus was smaller, had more teeth, fewer vertebrae, and more erosion on the pterygoids and frontals than T. truncatus. Overall cranium shape was round in T. aduncus and angular in T. truncatus. Skull length of T. aduncus was smaller in low than in high latitudes. This study highlights the importance of large sample size, multiple analytical methods, and extensive geographical coverage when undertaking taxonomic studies. © 2019 Canadian Science Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean-watching tourism has become an economically important recreation industry, but can compromise cetacean viability and hence tourism sustainability. While current management tactics pay much attention on industrialized cetacean-watching tourisms, impacts of tours operated by motorized boats in inshore waters are seldom discussed. This study investigated the spatial and temporal activities of dolphin-watching tours in Sanniang Bay, China, where tours specifically focus on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis). The primary boat-dolphin interaction directly overlaps with a core habitat of humpback dolphins. Average tour duration was shorter than 40 min and approximately one third of time was spent on following dolphins. Monthly tour activities were extremely high in February, early May, August, and October that corresponded to Chinese national festivals. An eastward shift of primary interaction site during high-tour-activity months implies a long-term tour impacts on habitat use of humpback dolphins in northern Beibu Gulf. We urge a collaboration and coordination between boat captains, tour managers, maritime administrative, academic teams, and NGOs to systematically collect tour statistics in Sanniang Bay, including daily tour and visitor numbers, encounter duration and locations, and unsustainable maritime activities. As eco-tourisms targeting humpback dolphins and other coastal cetaceans adopting small motorized boats are rapidly growing in southeastern Asia, management guidelines involving codes of conduct, allowable daily trips, and sustainable tourism tactics are urgently needed before the tourism becomes industrialized and economically oriented. Variables and statistics presented in this study can provide a baseline proxy to help design management guidelines to minimize unsustainable impacts on the target animals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: South American sub-continent, housed the largest diversity of river dolphins on the planet, here there are two species in the genus Sotalia and three species in the genus Inia. Tonina, present on the Orinoco basin, are expose to many different anthropogenic threats, such as: the fragmentation and loss of aquatic ecosystems; acoustic contamination; risk of collision with boats; entanglement; deaths by retaliation, resulting from biological and operational interactions with artisanal and industrial fisheries; biomagnification of heavy metals such as mercury in the aquatic trophic web; capture of individuals for their usage as bait for the fishery of Calophysus macropterus, primarily on borderline localities between Colombia and Venezuela; and finally, the negative effects of climate change. We conducted a study to determine population sizes and anthropogenic threats affecting river dolphins populations during the beginning of high-water season, between November 2018 and February of 2019, along 1,402 km. We calculated the degradation index for streams of continental waters and density of the river dolphins. Water quality, habitat transformation, species exploitation, and the increment in number of human settlements were identified as the main conservation stressor in the analyzed area. We obtained density values by habitat type for different aquatic environments and population sizes for river dolphins and the value in the index of degradation, with a potential increment in value through time. River confluences were identified as priority areas for the conservation of the species. Water quality, habitat modification, and species exploitation were particularly intense. Our results highlight a potential transformation of the ideal conditions that allow for the establishment of the species, explaining its distribution with predicted values between 46.6 % and 70.1 % for the evaluated timeframe due to the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems. The Meta River, has the highest value for the index of freshwater ecosystems degradation followed by the Orinoco basin, water quality and species exploitation appear to be the major stressors for dolphins in these areas. Finally, river confluences were identified as conservation hot spots for dolphin populations. We point out on the importance of river dolphins as bioindicator, sentinel species, and one of the most susceptible to the negative effects of climate change. © 2020 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología,.

ABSTRACT: The use of cryopreserved dolphin spermatozoa facilitates the exchange of genetic material between aquatic parks and makes spermatozoa accessible to laboratories for studies to further our understanding of marine mammal reproduction. Sperm cryopreservation in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) has been developed for the exchange of gametes within the ex situ population. The aim of this study was to develop an effective method for refrigeration of bottlenose dolphin spermatozoa diluted in a commercial extender (BTS). In Experiment 1, the effect of temperature (5 compared with 15 °C) on sperm quality was evaluated during 7 days of storage at 100 × 106 spermatozoa/ml. In Experiment 2, the effect of the storage concentration (100 × 106 compared with 20 × 106 spermatozoa/ml) on sperm quality was assessed during 7 days of storage at 5 °C. In Experiment 1, total motility (including % of rapid sperm) was greater at 5 than 15 °C. When the effect of storage concentration was evaluated (Experiment 2), total motility and ALH were greater at the higher storage concentration (100 × 106 spermatozoa/ml). For both experiments, values for viability, acrosome integrity, and normal morphology variables were consistent throughout the 7 days of refrigeration. In Experiment 3, a microbiological study was performed to evaluate the effect of the refrigeration temperature and days of storage on bacterial growth. The results of microbiological analysis indicated there was Staphylococcus aureus in some samples, however, there was no effect of temperature or days of refrigeration. In conclusion, bottlenose dolphin semen can be refrigerated for a short to medium period of storage and there is maintenance of functionality of sperm when stored at 100 × 106 spermatozoa/ml at 5 °C. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Citizen science is increasingly popular and has the potential to collect extensive datasets at lower costs than traditional surveys conducted by professional scientists. Ferries have been used to collect data on cetacean populations for decades, providing long-term time series for monitoring of cetacean populations. One cetacean species of concern is the common dolphin, which has been found stranded around the north-east Atlantic in recent years, with high numbers on French coasts being attributed to fisheries bycatch. We estimate common dolphin densities in the north-east Atlantic and investigate the ability of citizen science data to identify changes in marine mammal densities and areas of importance. Materials and Methods: Data were collected by citizen scientists on ferries between April and October in 2006-2017. Common dolphin sightings data from two ferry routes across three regions, Bay of Biscay (n = 569); south-west United Kingdom to the Isles of Scilly in the Celtic Sea (n = 260); and English Channel (n = 75), were used to estimate density across ferry routes. Two-stage Density Surface Models accounted for imperfect detection, and tested the influence of environmental (chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, depth, and slope), spatial (latitude and longitude) and temporal terms (year and Julian day) on occurrence. Results: Overall detection probability was highest in the areas sampled within the English Channel (0.384) and Bay of Biscay (0.348), and lowest on the Scilly's route (0.158). Common dolphins were estimated to occur in higher densities on the Scilly's route (0.400 per km2) and the Bay of Biscay (0.319 per km2), with low densities in the English Channel (0.025 per km2). Densities on the Scilly's route appear to have been relatively stable since 2006 with a slight decrease in 2017. Densities peaked in the Bay of Biscay in 2013 with lower numbers since. Densities in the English Channel appear to have increased over time since 2009. Discussion: This study highlights the effectiveness of citizen science data to investigate the distribution and density of cetaceans. The densities and temporal changes shown by this study are representative of those from wider-ranging robust estimates. We highlight the ability of citizen science to collect data over extensive periods of time which complements dedicated, designed surveys. Such long-term data are important to identify changes within a population; however, citizen science data may, in some situations, present challenges. We provide recommendations to ensure high-quality data which can be used to inform management and conservation of cetacean populations. Copyright © 2020 Robbins et al.

ABSTRACT: Place-based management can be an effective conservation tool to protect cetaceans from anthropogenic pressures. The spatial use of the world's second largest population of the threatened Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) is not well-documented, which makes it challenging to designate protected areas for this population. To address this knowledge gap and to test the efficacy of an existing dolphin protected area (Zhanjiang Leizhou Bay Municipal Humpback Dolphin Nature Reserve, ZLBMHDNR), boat-based surveys were conducted to document dolphin occurrence from 2015 to 2018, covering an area of 1221 km2 in the eastern waters off Zhanjiang, China. In total, 253 dolphin group sightings were obtained during 174 survey days. Spatial analysis showed that humpback dolphins aggregated in three core-use areas with higher sighting density within the survey area. Furthermore, intermediate-use and broad-use areas were identified that could be essential for the movements of humpback dolphins among these core-use areas. The spatial usage of humpback dolphins was compared inside and outside the ZLBMHDNR. Results suggest that the ZLBMHDNR is insufficient to encompass a significant portion of dolphin habitat. The ZLBMHDNR (21 km2) is not large enough, and thus it should be expanded for effective place-based conservation management in this region. For developing a protected area network, important dolphin habitats identified in this study should be protected as a single management unit. Additionally, mitigation of anthropogenic pressures is needed to be taken into consideration as conservation initiatives in the study area. This study provides support for a more science-informed protected area network, and highlights the necessity of implementing place-based conservation and management for the world's second largest humpback dolphin population. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Male alliances are an intriguing phenomenon in the context of reproduction since, in most taxa, males compete over an indivisible resource, female fertilization. Adult male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, form long-term, multilevel alliances to sequester estrus females. These alliances are therefore critical to male reproductive success. Yet, the long-term processes leading to the formation of such complex social bonds are still poorly understood. To identify the criteria by which male dolphins form social bonds with other males, we adopted a long-term approach by investigating the ontogeny of alliance formation. We followed the individual careers of 59 males for 14 years while they transitioned from adolescence (8-14 years of age) to adulthood (15-21 years old). Analyzing their genetic relationships and social associations in both age groups, we found that the vast majority of social bonds present in adolescence persisted through time. Male associations in early life predict alliance partners as adults. Kinship patterns explained associations during adolescence but not during adulthood. Instead, adult males associated with males of similar age. Our findings suggest that social bonds among peers, rather than kinship, play a central role in the development of adult male polyadic cooperation in dolphins. Multilevel cooperation in adult male bottlenose dolphins is based on friendships that are formed among similarly aged males during their adolescence. Although cooperative behaviors in many animals are found among relatives, this is not the case in dolphins. Our findings reveal the existence of enduring friendships in a complex marine mammal society, similar to those that have been described in many primate species including humans. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

ABSTRACT: The Bolivian river dolphin, known locally as the bufeo, is one of 4 species of river dolphin in South America. Endemic to the upper basin of the Madeira in the Bolivian Amazon region, the species is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. This article provides information related to the geographic distribution of the species, and a review of the studies of its abundance that have been conducted in Bolivia since the 1970s. We discuss the surveys, the analysis methods used in the different studies, and the ways in which these methods might influence the population estimates. We found 63 population abundance estimates for the Bolivian river dolphin across 17 reviewed publications. These studies report relative abundance data for rivers that range from 0.2 to 2.81 bufeos km-1, and density ranges from 0 to 7.59 bufeos km-2. The information presented here reflects the knowledge of the population size of the species in Bolivia obtained over 4 de-cades, and will be useful for developing conservation strategies and as a tool for decision makers. © The authors 2020.

ABSTRACT: The Irrawaddy dolphins in Guimaras Strait compose the second population to be reported in the Philippines. Their very small population size, isolation, and high vulnerability to human-induced threats in the coastal areas have earned them a local conservation status of critically endangered. Appropriate conservation and management of this species will need a better understanding of their relationship with their known habitat and interactions with human activities. Regular boat-based surveys were conducted in a defined study area in the coastal waters of Bago and Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, Philippines, to document behaviour and gather photo ID data from 2010 to 2016. Behaviour and habitat use were quantified using area use and activity indices, while site fidelity was analysed using photo catalogues. Of the nineteen catalogued individuals, at least eight dolphins were present throughout the study, indicating high site fidelity. The dolphins used a relatively small nearshore area spanning a commercial port and northward towards the mouth of Bago River. The Minimum Convex Polygon area is estimated at 12.68 km2 and is one of the smallest core areas known to have been recorded for this species. The dolphins showed a preference for areas with a steep increase in water depth and were often observed foraging, highlighting the importance of these areas as feeding grounds. Several threats to the dolphins were identified, most of which are related to human activities. Identifying the behavioural aspects of the Irrawaddy dolphins’ local ecology helps put the scope and limitations of managing their population into perspective and provides the critical information needed to delineate special management or conservation areas in their habitat. © National University of Singapore.

ABSTRACT: This chapter looks in closer detail at hydrodam projects in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region and their legacy; primarily so-called ‘green energy’ hydrodam developments are done in pristine and great landscapes, and sometimes in relation with protected areas such as found in Chitwan, Nepal and several ones in Tibet. Six species and topics are discussed here specifically and a cumulative impact view is promoted. It is shown that endangered species fare poorly, such as the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the river dolphin (Platanista gangetica); fish migration is poorly studied but also affected resulting in food security issues and in the wholesale destruction of formerly sustainable lifestyles for centuries. Electricty production, e.g. for industrial projects, has increased and leaves us with a massive footprint and problem, globally. It equals ‘social engineering’ and created the ‘homo electricus’. We found that hydrodams are not benign for impacts, and not sustainable on most metrics. Here the wider strategic implications are discussed towards a more sustainable lifestyle in the watersheds of the HKH region and worldwide where as hydrodams are still globally promoted -naively and wrongly- as so-called successful ‘green energy’ concepts. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: Temporal trens in plasma concentrations of per- an polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in free-ranging bottlenose olphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting two geographic areas: Inian River Lagoon, Floria over the years 2003-2015 an the waters surrouning Charleston, South Carolina over 2003-2013, were examine. Nine PFAS met the inclusion criteria for analysis base on percent of values below level of etection an sampling years. Proportionate percentiles parametric quantile regression assuming lognormal istributions was use to estimate the average ratio of PFAS concentrations per year for each chemical. Plasma concentrations ecrease over time for perfluoroecanoate (PFDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an perfluorounecanoate (PFUnDA) in both locations. Perfluorononanoate (PFNA) ecrease with time in Inian River Lagoon olphins. Perfluorooecanoate (PFDoDA) concentrations significantly increase over time among female Inian River Lagoon olphins. Regulation an phaseout of specific PFAS groups may have le to the ecreasing levels of those PFAS an increasing levels of other replacement PFAS. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: The South American river dolphins of genus Inia are distributed throughout the Amazon, Orinoco and Araguaia-Tocantins basins. They are categorized as Endangered and the knowledge on their basic ecology is still scarce. Therefore, investigation efforts must contribute to the knowledge and conservation of these species in their area of distribution. For the Bolivian river dolphin we used a database of 10 years of upstream and downstream surveys, accumulating approximately 6,100 km of double routes from three main rivers of the Upper Madeira River basin (Ibare, Mamoré and Tijamuchi) by following standardized methods where each encounter with a single or a group of river dolphins was registered. Preferred sites by Bolivian river dolphin were based on Kernel density estimation. This methodology considers the accumulated data of georeferenced sightings, generating a map of probability of occurrence in each river. In the three rivers, the accumulated density of sightings is concentrated in meanders and confluences, resulting in a high probability of sighting Bolivian river dolphin in these habitats. It was also identified that the number of Bolivian river dolphin sightings decreased over time in the upper Tijamuchi River. The Bolivian river dolphin preferred both meanders and confluence habitats. Between the Ibare and Tijamuchi rivers (Mamoré sub-basin), the distribution of the species tended to be more uniform. According to these results, it is important to reinforce the management of the Ibare-Mamoré municipal protected area, since important Bolivian river dolphin populations are concentrated there. Same trend was also shown in the lower-middle zone of the Tijamuchi River, suggesting the need of implementing conservation strategies in this area, where currently there are none. Los delfines de río sudamericanos del género Inia se distribuyen por las cuencas del Amazonas, Orinoco y Araguaia-Tocantins, se clasifican como en peligro de extinción y el conocimiento sobre su ecología básica aún es escaso. Por lo tanto, las investigaciones deben contribuir a la conservación y el conocimiento de estas especies en su área de distribución. Para el delfín del río boliviano, utilizamos una base de datos de 10 años de recorridos río aguas-arriba y río aguas-abajo, acumulando aproximadamente 6,100 km de rutas dobles en tres ríos principales en la subcuenca alta del río Madeira (Ibare, Mamoré y Tijamuchi). Siguiendo los métodos estandarizados cada encuentro con uno o un grupo de delfines de río fue registrado. La identificación de los sitios preferidos por los bufeos fue estimada por la densidad del Kernel. Esta metodología considera los datos acumulados de avistamientos georreferenciados que generan un mapa de probabilidad de ocurrencia en cada río. En los tres ríos, la densidad acumulada de avistamientos se concentra en meandros y confluencias, lo que resulta en una alta probabilidad de ver bufeos en estos hábitats. También se determinó que los avistamientos de bufeos han disminuido en la parte superior del río Tijamuchi. Los bufeos prefirieron los hábitats de meandros y de confluencia; entre los ríos Ibare y Tijamuchi (cuenca Mamoré), la distribución de las especies tendió a ser más uniforme. Según estos resultados, es importante reforzar la gestión del área protegida municipal de Ibare-Mamoré, ya que allí se concentran importantes poblaciones de bufeo. La misma tendencia también se mostró en la zona media-baja del río Tijamuchi, lo que sugiere la necesidad de implementar estrategias de conservación en esta área, donde actualmente todavía no se ha declarado ninguna. © 2020 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología.

ABSTRACT: At the time of COVID-19 social distancing, the move from the real to a digital public life has propagated viral videos of ‘capturing’ wild animals performing unusual behaviours in typically urban habitats. From Welsh sheep using rounda-bouts to dolphins swimming in the Venice canals, the real from the fake becomes difficult to discern through technological advances but also in the belief in the underlying ideological environmental message it enables. In this article, I examine how these viral videos are not only being faked for the social validation of likes and retweets but have also become a tool for ecofascism: a far-right ideology that marries environmentalism with white supremacist ethnonationalism. I examine how social media is used to implicitly spread ecofascist ideas through an environmentalism fakery such as the urban Venetian dolphin that shows how humans, not COVID-19, are the virus and how these human-less vignettes are ultimately used by ecofascists to argue against immigration in order to ‘bring nature back to the natural order of things’. In conclusion, I look at what the initial implications are for communication and environmentalism and the potential these human-less lockdowns have for making convincing arguments for even the smallest of societal changes to mitigate climate change. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Limited information is available on cetacean interactions with the parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Direct observations of sea lamprey attachment are rare, and the resulting wounds and scars often provide the only evidence of a parasite-host relationship. In spite of extensive research of natural markings such as nicks and skin scarring patterns, previous studies do not describe sea lamprey attachment marks on the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Herein, we used opportunistically taken photographs to present direct evidence of sea lamprey attachment on a bottlenose dolphin. Furthermore, we analysed photo-identification data from long-term bottlenose dolphin studies in the Adriatic Sea and found eight skin marks attributable to sea lamprey attachment, providing indirect evidence linking the two species. Size estimation and geographic exclusion were used to corroborate the findings. The presence of scars corresponding to pierced wounds confirms that active feeding took place. Sea lamprey attachment marks on bottlenose dolphins are identifiable but appear to be rare, hard to notice, and short-lived. Therefore, such scars are not suitable for long-term photo-identification. Our findings confirm the bottlenose dolphin is a sea lamprey host and highlight the need to assess possible negative impacts of such interactions. © 2020 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: From an evolutionary aspect, dolphins share a very close phylogenetic relationship with pigs. Previously, we characterized porcine cerebral artery responsiveness to intrinsic vasoactive substances. Therefore, here, we investigated dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) cerebral artery responsiveness to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), histamine (His), angiotensin (Ang) II, acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), and bradykinin (BK) to characterize their related receptor subtypes. We also compared dolphin cerebral artery responsiveness with porcine cerebral artery responsiveness. We found that 5-HT and His induced concentration-dependent contraction of the dolphin cerebral artery. Ketanserin (a 5-HT2 antagonist) and methiothepin (a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for 5-HT to the right. Although diphenhydramine (an H1 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for His to the right, cimetidine (an H2 antagonist) had no such effect. Ang II and ACh did not produce any vasomotor actions. NA induced concentration-dependent relaxation. Propranolol (a β antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for NA to the right, whereas phentolamine (an α antagonist) had no significant effect. BK induced relaxation followed by contraction in pre-contracted arteries with intact endothelium. HOE140 (a B2 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for BK to the right, whereas des-Arg9-[Leu8 ]-BK (a B1 antagonist) had no significant effect. These results suggest that 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and H1 receptor subtypes are important in arterial contraction and that β and B2 receptor subtypes modify these contractions to relaxations. The responsiveness of the dolphin cerebral artery is very similar to that of porcine cerebral artery, supporting their evolutionary linkage. © 2020 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Social systems are characterized by the associations and interactions between individuals. For highly social groups such as delphinids, understanding the demographics and long-term association patterns of a population is the first step in interpreting its overall social structure and specific relationships between individuals. This study investigated the social patterns of a population of Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) off Bimini, The Bahamas, during a 14-year period (2003–2016). We generated association indices and conducted cluster, network, and temporal analyses using SOCPROG 2.8. Dolphins in this population display long-term, year-round residency around Bimini, as well as long-term preferences in association with a combination of rapid disassociation, constant companions, and casual acquaintances. We found no evidence of distinct social clusters within the study group; however, we discovered at least one subgroup with higher association than the rest of the population. This group was composed of male spotted dolphins, which overall tended to associate together more than females and chose companions with similar levels of association to themselves. Despite strong relationships between males, we found no evidence for the existence of alliances or coalitions. This study provides a baseline understanding of the social structure of this population that will allow us to investigate the variable relationships between individuals, in addition to exploring the effects of demographic changes within the resident population. © 2019, ISPA, CRL.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans and humans shared the same route of exposure to many anthropogenic contaminants via fish consumption. To assess the health risks associated with heavy metal levels in fishes from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and the seasonal dynamics, 13 fish species (n = 675) consumed by the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and humans were analyzed for concentrations of nine heavy metals. Heavy metal levels vary significantly by species and by season in the PRE fishes. The two eel goby species were the most contaminated fish species, which had the highest levels of Cu, Pb, Hg, Mn and Se. Levels of non-essential metals (As and Pb) in many different fish species were all found significantly higher in dry season than in wet season, which may reflect the dilution effect on contaminant levels in the PRE waters in rainy season. For essential metals, Cu, Cr and Se in many fish species were significantly higher in dry season compared to wet season, while Se and Mn in the other fish species showed an opposite pattern, since essential metal accumulation could be influenced by several physiological processes in life. Risk assessment for dolphins showed that inorganic-As levels in all fishes exceeded the safe limits, whereas a more conservative approach indicated that the levels of all metals in all fish samples had toxic effects on dolphins, except for Hg. Human health risk analysis showed that inorganic-As levels in tonguesole (all year) and sillago (dry season) and Cr levels in pomfret (dry season) exceeded the acceptable values. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The development of offshore wind farms has been a way for the state to repackage national development projects using green energy discourses. In Taiwan, where the further development of nuclear power is suspended due to public antinuclear sentiment, offshore wind farms have been heavily promoted as a way of meeting electricity demand. The planned site for offshore wind farms, mainly the intertidal zone along the coast of Changhua County, overlaps with both oyster farms and the habitat of Taiwanese humpbacked dolphins, categorized as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This has resulted in a clash between conserving the oyster farming landscape, protecting an endangered species, and developing green energy. Facing this dilemma, pro–wind farm discourses that highlight concerns about global climate change have gradually supplanted those stressing the welfare of oysters and dolphins, even though the latter have been used successfully as local icons by movements opposing previous development projects on the intertidal zone. This article reconsiders the politics of territorialization implied by the “green” label affixed to offshore wind farm projects and other forms of green energy in general. As such, the meaning of offshore wind farms, as a newly discovered energy resource, is intertwined with the changing meanings of both dolphins and oyster farms, as rival nonhuman objects of resource exploitation and natural conservation. The territorialization of such resources in the emerging discursive space of green energy has proceeded via relational placemaking with nonlinear connections among multiple human and nonhuman elements. Key Words: conservation, intertidal zone, landscape, renewable resources, resource frontier. © 2019, © 2019 by American Association of Geographers.

ABSTRACT: Harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins have severe negative impacts on marine mammals, particularly for Florida bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) which frequently experience mass mortality events. Dolphins on the Florida Atlantic coast inhabit a region endemic to two HAB species, Karenia brevis and Pyrodinium bahamense, which produce the neurotoxins brevetoxin (PbTx) and saxitoxin (STX), respectively. Although toxic HABs and associated dolphin mortality events have been reported from this region, there is a lack of available data necessary for comparing toxin exposure levels between bloom (‘exposed’) conditions and non-bloom (‘baseline’) conditions. Here we present a 10-year dataset of PbTx and STX concentrations detected in dolphins stranding in this region, and compare the toxin loads from HAB-exposed dolphins to those detected in dolphins recovered in the absence of a HAB. We analyzed liver tissue samples from dead-stranded dolphins (n = 119) recovered and necropsied between 2002–2011, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) modified for use with mammalian tissues. For dolphins recovered during baseline conditions, toxin-positive samples ranged in concentration from 0.27 to 1.2 ng/g for PbTx and from 0.41 to 1.9 ng/g for STX. For K. brevis-exposed dolphins, concentrations of up to 12.1 ng PbTx/g were detected, and for P. bahamense-exposed dolphins, concentrations of up to 9.9 ng STX/g were detected. Baseline PbTx values were similar to those reported in other regions where K. brevis blooms are more frequent and severe, but HAB-exposed PbTx values were considerably lower relative to these other regions. Since no baseline STX dolphin data exist for any region, our data serve as a first step towards establishing reference STX values for potential dolphin mortality events associated with STX-producing blooms in the future. This study demonstrates that although HABs in eastern Florida are only infrequently associated with dolphin mortalities, the presence of toxins in these animals may pose significant health risks in this region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Our objective was to analyze the main anatomical structures of the dolphin head during its developmental stages. Most dolphin studies use only one fetal specimen due to the difficulty in obtaining these materials. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of two fetuses (younger and older) and a perinatal specimen cadaver of striped dolphins were scanned. Only the older fetus was frozen and then was transversely cross-sectioned. In addition, gross dissections of the head were made on a perinatal and an adult specimen. In the oral cavity, only the mandible and maxilla teeth have started to erupt, while the most rostral teeth have not yet erupted. No salivary glands and masseter muscle were observed. The melon was well identified in CT/MRI images at early stages of development. CT and MRI images allowed observation of the maxillary sinus. The orbit and eyeball were analyzed and the absence of infraorbital rim together with the temporal process of the zygomatic bone holding periorbit were described. An enlarged auditory tube was identified using anatomical sections, CT, and MRI. We also compare the dolphin head anatomy with some mammals, trying to underline the anatomical and physiological changes and explain them from an ontogenic point of view. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In Europe, monitoring contaminant concentrations and their effects in the marine environment is required under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC). The striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) is the most abundant small cetacean species in Portuguese oceanic waters, representing a potential biomonitoring tool of contaminant levels in offshore waters. Concentrations of nine trace elements were evaluated by ICP-MS in kidney, liver and muscle samples of 31 striped dolphins stranded in the Portuguese continental coast. The mean renal Cd concentration was high (19.3 μg.g−1 wet weight, range 0.1–69.3 μg.g−1 wet weight) comparing to striped dolphins from other locations. Therefore, the present study reports a possibly concerning level of Cd in the oceanic food chain in Portuguese offshore areas. This study also aimed at evaluating potential relationships between trace element concentrations and striped dolphins' biological and health-related variables. Individual length was related with some of the trace element concentrations detected in striped dolphins. Indeed, Cd, Hg and Se bioaccumulated in larger animals, whereas the reverse was observed for Mn and Zn. Striped dolphins with high parasite burdens showed higher levels of Hg, while animals showing gross pathologies presented higher concentrations of Cd and Se. This study reported relationships between trace element concentrations and health-related variables for the first time in striped dolphins and it also provided information on the relative contamination status of Portuguese oceanic waters in comparison to other regions in the world. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Despite their typical large group sizes, limited research exists on the occurrence of common dolphins Delphinus delphis because of the pelagic, offshore nature of this species and the lack of barriers to their movement in this environment. The main purpose of our study was to investigate the occurrence of common dolphins off the Wild Coast of South Africa (western Indian Ocean) and whether spatiotemporal and environmental conditions affected their encounter rate, relative abundance and mean group size. The annual sardine run in this region, during austral winter (May to July), is considered a main driver of dolphin occurrence; however, our boat-based surveys over the period 2014–2016 indicated that common dolphins occur and feed in this area outside of this time-frame. In terms of environmental factors, the largest group (∼1 250 animals) was found in the deepest waters. Additionally, at Hluleka, dolphins were observed primarily feeding, which could suggest that this coastal area is highly productive. As common dolphin distribution is thought to be correlated with prey distribution, our findings suggest that sufficient prey exists along the Wild Coast both during and outside the annual sardine run to sustain large groups of the dolphins and that their presence in the area is not solely a function of the sardine run. © 2020 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: A comprehensive evaluation of the effects of sex, age, and season on blood analytes in a robust population size of ex situ bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) has not been investigated to date. Aim: To define the variation in hematological and biochemical analytes of dolphins due to sex, age, and season. Methods: 1,426 blood samples collected from 156 clinically normal dolphins consisting of 59 males and 97 females in which 37 analytes were measured were retrospectively identified. The dolphins were categorized by age, sex, and season, and categories were compared. Results: About 23 (64%) analytes differed by age. The number of differences between adjacent age groups decreased with advancing age. MPV, glucose, BUN, globulins, GGT and Cl progressively increased with age, whereas Abs lymphs, total protein, ALP, CK and Ca progressively decreased with age. Three (8%) of analytes differed between sex, whereas 16 (44%) analytes differed by season. Female dolphins had higher median iron (33 µmol/L) than male dolphins (25 µmol/L). Female dolphins also had higher Abs lymphs and MCHC, but Abs lymphs and MCHC also differed between age and season, respectively. Sex inconsistently and relatively infrequently influences analytes. Delphinids of advancing age experience immune senescence and decreasing renal perfusion or clearance. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of considering the influences of sex, age, and season on blood data, provide a baseline for accurate interpretation of clinicopathological analytes of delphinids in managed care, and will be useful for investigations into health, disease, and stressors of wild delphinids. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Photo-identification has been used to monitor the resident bottlenose dolphin (Dirsiops iruncuius) population in the Lower River Shannon Special Area of Conservation in Ireland as part of European Union obligations since 1997. A discovery curve using data collected by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG) between 2011 and 2015 suggested all animals in the population were captured during this period, providing an abundance of 145 extant individuals. The IWDG photo-identification catalogue was compared with an independendy derived photo-identification catalogue compiled by the National Parks and Wildlife Service during 2015 to identify whether any individuals were not captured by the IWDG during that year; there were uone. Mark-recapture analysis of both photo-identification catalogues indicated that the higher survey effort provided a higher and more precise abundance estimate, and the estimate of 145 individuals in the population was supported. Population Viability Analysis using this most up-to-date abundance estimate and new data on life-history characteristics were used to explore population status under a range of potential scenarios. A baseline model showed slowly declining dynamics with a growth rate (r) of-0.007. An increase in adult mortality from 3.3 to 7.0% (e.g., due to bycatch) led to a steep decline in population size. Similar results were obtained when the effects of an infrequent catastrophic event (e. g_. a large oil spill) were simulated. Sensitivity analysis revealed the importance of female reproductive capacity for population viability. These results will help local managers to understand the implications of events that may affect this small, genetically discrete resident population. The current monitoring strategy may be insufficient to obtain a thorough understanding of population dynamics; hence, higher survey effort is recommended to gain a better knowledge of key demographic parameters which may affect population viability, especially those limiting female reproductive capacity. © 2020, European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: A subset of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus gephyreus population in Laguna, southern Brazil, specialize in foraging cooperatively with fishermen. In this study, we describe reproductive parameters for these dolphins and investigate whether this specialized tactic generates reproductive advantages for females that frequently engage in this unusual behavior. We analyzed photo-identification data collected during 233 boat-based surveys during 2007–2009 and 2013–2017. From 27,808 high-quality photographs, we identified and tracked the fate of 24 reproductive females and 45 of their calves. Calving was found to be seasonal, with most births occurring in late spring/summer. The average crude birth rate was 0.09, and estimated fecundity was 0.17. The mean inter-birth interval was 2.09 (for all calves) or 2.43 years (for surviving calves only). Survival to 1 and 2 years estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method was 0.78 (95% CI 0.65–0.92) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.51–0.83), respectively—which represents a survival rate in the second year of 0.83. We investigated the potential influence of birth timing, resource availability, and maternal foraging tactic, home range size and frequency of interaction with fishermen on calf survival. Timing of birth was a significant predictor of calf survival. Giving birth close to the local mullet season would provide lactating females with increased seasonal prey resources, leading to increased calf survival. Due to our sample size (n = 9 cooperative and 15 non-cooperative females), we could not conclude whether or not the cooperative foraging tactic influences calf survival and female reproductive success. We emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring of populations to understand regional life history characteristics and provide accurate information for viability analyses. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Baseline knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for cetacean management and conservation. Such knowledge is particularly important in areas where gillnet fishing occurs, as the Upper Gulf of California, which increases the probability of bycatch of cetaceans. In this area, the vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) has been widely studied, but the knowledge of other cetaceans is scarce and based on traditional visual survey methods. We used data collected by an array of acoustic click detectors (C-PODs) during the summers 2011 to 2015 to analyze the distribution of dolphins in the Vaquita Refuge in the Upper Gulf of California. We recorded 120,038 echolocation click trains of dolphins during 12,371 days of recording effort at 46 sampling sites. Based on simultaneous visual and acoustic data, we estimated a false positive acoustic detection rate of 19.4%. Dolphin acoustic activity varied among sites, with higher activity in the east of the Vaquita Refuge. Acoustic activity was higher at night than during the day. We used negative binomial generalized linear models to study the count of clicks of dolphins in relation to spatial, temporal, physical, biological and anthropogenic explanatory variables. The best model selected for the response variable included sampling site, day-night condition, and vertical component of tide speed. Patterns in the spatial distribution of predicted acoustic activity of dolphins were similar to the acoustic activity observed per sampling season. Higher acoustic activity was predicted at night, but the tide speed variable was not relevant under this condition. Acoustic activity patterns could be related to the availability of prey resources since echolocation click trains are associated with foraging activities of dolphins. This is the first study of the distribution of dolphins in Mexico using medium-term systematic passive acoustic monitoring, and the results can contribute to better management to the natural protected area located in the Upper Gulf of California. © 2020 PeerJ Inc..

ABSTRACT: A previously published analytical method demonstrated the quantification of the hormone cortisol in cetacean skin. However, little is known about the transfer of hormones between blood and skin. Recognizing that such information is essential to effectively using skin samples within marine mammal stress research, the primary goals of this study were to (i) expand on the number of steroid hormones proved quantifiable in the cetacean skin matrix and (ii) validate the use of cetacean skin as a matrix for measuring stress-related hormones. Five adult bottlenose dolphins were subjected to an out of water stress test. Non-invasive sloughed skin samples were collected from each dolphin: once ~3 and once ~1 week prior to the stress test; at the time of the stress test; and twice weekly for 11 to 17 weeks subsequent to the stress test. LCMS/MS analysis of the samples recovered consistent data on three corticosteroids (cortisol, aldosterone, corticosterone), two androgens (testosterone, DHEA) and one progestagen (progesterone). A range of other hormones were also quantifiable, although not consistently so across samples. Results demonstrated that the hormonal response to an acute stressor could be detected in skin: the time from stress test to skin cortisol peak was an average of 46 days, whereas it was 55 days for corticosterone and 47 days for aldosterone. Results also showed that baseline hormonal concentrations were obtainable from skin samples collected during or immediately after the animals were subjected to the acute stressor. This study further develops and validates a non-invasive method for measuring cortisol and other hormones related to stress, health, and reproduction in the skin of cetaceans, potentially supporting investigations of acute and chronic stress, such as cetacean endocrine responses to distinct (e.g. naval sonar exposure) or prolonged stressors (e.g. shipping noise).  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: The physiological demands of pregnancy inevitably result in changes of both biochemical and hematological parameters as the fetus develops. Alterations in blood parameters have been observed to shift according to both trimester and species, to support fetal physiological needs and maternal basal requirements. Establishing normal reference ranges for each stage in gestation is important to facilitate diagnosis of underlying health concerns and prevent over-diagnosing abnormalities. Despite bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) being one of the most highly studied cetaceans, the blood profile changes occurring as a result of pregnancy have not been previously described. A retrospective analysis was performed from blood samples obtained from 42 successful pregnancies from 20 bottlenose dolphins in a managed population over 30 years. Samples were compared to non-pregnant states and among trimesters of pregnancy. Blood profile fluctuations occurred throughout gestation, however significant alterations predominantly occurred between the 2nd and 3rd trimester. Hematological changes from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester included a decrease in lymphocytes, decrease in platelet count, and hemoconcentration with increased hematocrit and hemoglobin. Biochemical changes in the 3rd trimester included significant reductions in ALKP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) with significant increases observed in albumin, globulins, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides and CO2. It's important to note that despite significant shifts occurring between the 2nd and 3rd trimester, there was no significant change in platelets, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes or CO2 between non-pregnant and 3rd trimester blood samples. The normal reference ranges for each trimester established herein, will enable future identification of abnormalities occurring during pregnancy and help improve our understanding of factors potentially influencing a failed or successful pregnancy outcome. © 2019 The Authors

ABSTRACT: There exists a surprising diversity in the physiology and endocrinology of pregnancy among mammals in both the source (luteal/placental) and metabolism of progesterone. To evaluate the possible diversity of steroid metabolism within toothed cetaceans, we investigated 5α-reduced progesterone metabolites and androgens in cyclic (luteal phase) and pregnant captive killer whales, belugas and bottlenose dolphins (n = 5/species) bled longitudinally in early, mid- and late pregnancy (0.16, 0.50 and 0.85 fractions of 535, 464 and 380 gestation days, respectively). Mid-luteal samples were also collected. Serum was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry as previously validated for (among others) progesterone, 20αOH-progesterone (20αOHP), 5α-dihydroprogesterone (DHP), several additional 5α-reduced metabolites and androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione and testosterone). The predominant mid-luteal pregnanes were: progesterone, belugas; progesterone and 20αOHP, dolphins; allopregnanolone (3α-DHP) and progesterone, killer whales. Progesterone was 2-4-fold higher in early pregnancy than mid-luteal samples but decreased thereafter. The predominant metabolite, 3β,20α-dihydroprogesterone (3β,20α-DHP; 40–80 ng/ml) was higher in mid- and late-than early gestation in all 3 species. Concentrations of 20αOHP and 3β,20α-DHP were similar at mid-gestation but 20αOHP declined in late-gestation in killer whales, and 20αOHP was lower than 3β,20α-DHP in belugas and dolphins throughout gestation. Other 5α-reduced metabolites, DHP, 3α-DHP and 20α-DHP, were far lower throughout pregnancy (<10 ng/ml). DHP and 3α-DHP decreased from early to mid-gestation in belugas, but changed little in killer whales and dolphins. These data suggest that progesterone metabolism is relatively conserved among these cetacean species. As in equine pregnancies, 3β,20α-DHP is the major metabolite, increasing at the expense of progesterone as pregnancy progresses. Androstenedione and testosterone also increased detectably in mid- to late-gestation in these species. The tissue source remains unknown, but progesterone metabolism during gestation in these cetaceans is similar to horses and, together with androgens, may be reliable biomarkers of pregnancy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) are a globally Endangered cetacean species found in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters across Southeast Asia. Whilst much attention has concentrated on understanding freshwater populations of the species, marine populations have received less research attention, with the majority of marine studies focusing on determining abundance and distribution. As part of The Cambodian Marine Mammal Conservation Project, the current study utilises a combination of year-long land and boat survey techniques to identify seasonal critical habitats for the species in Cambodia’s Kep Archipelago, as well as fill knowledge gaps on the species’ behavioural ecology, to contribute to the design of effective and tailored regional conservation strategies. Results showed Irrawaddy dolphins to be present in the Kep Archipelago in all seasons, with the highest encounter rates in Summer Monsoon (May–September) and Post-Monsoon (October–November) seasons, and the lowest encounter rates in Pre-Monsoon season (March–April). Juveniles were present in all seasons, suggesting the region represents an important nursing ground for the population. Foraging was the most commonly observed behaviour, with significant associations found between certain behavioural states and events, group sizes and seasons, group sizes and juvenile presence, and swim styles and juvenile presence. © National University of Singapore.

ABSTRACT: The Ganges River Dolphin Platanista gangetica has been classified as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The IUCN changed its status from 'Vulnerable' to 'Endangered' in 1996 as the species population was declining in its entire distribution range. It is, however, classified as 'Critically Endangered' in Nepal. Historically, the freshwater cetacean has been documented in the Karnali, Koshi, Narayani, and Mahakali basins. With their population and distribution range in decline, the Ganges River Dolphin (GRD) is no longer found in the Mahakali River system, which demarcates and traverses the Western border of India and Nepal. This study examines the status and distribution of the GRD in the river systems of Nepal during the monsoon of 2016. The national dolphin population survey was conducted in the three largest river basins in Nepal-Karnali, Narayani, and Koshi. Each of the three basins represent the extreme upstream limit of the GRD distribution in Ganges River basin. The national population survey included both a boat-based survey and shore-based synchronized counting in each of the three river systems. Fifty-two (Best-High-Low: 52-61-50) dolphins were counted during the entire nationwide survey, conducted in July-August, 2016. Researchers gathered social-data from locals residing alongside the observed basin, giving priority to artisanal fishers and those subsisting to some degree from the rivers known to host the river dolphin. A questionnaire survey of ninety-two residents from riparian villages adjacent to the GRD hotspots sheds light on the local perspectives towards dolphin conservation coupled with an assessment of their socio-economic status; artisanal fishing practices; and their awareness of dolphin conservation. According to the survey, notable threats to dolphin conservation are prey depletion; non-availability of suitable habitat; habitat fragmentation and a low level of awareness. Based on the counting outcomes and social survey, recommendations have been put forward for the conservation of this species. © Shah et al 2020.

ABSTRACT: Scientific observer programs in fisheries are being deployed worldwide in order to obtain robust data for fishery studies, and in relation to its interaction with target and bycatch species. A comparison between two observer programs in Mexican purse seine tuna fishery in the Eastern Pacific Ocean is performed considering the incidental mortality per trip as a metric recorded by both observers programs from 1999 to 2016. A Bayesian t-test approximation was used for the comparison between the two methods since, due to its probabilistic nature reduces uncertainty. The analysis showed a very low probability of differences for the estimated bycatch rate between both programs. © 2019, University of Valparaiso. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Scheduled scientific surveys are a valuable asset in beginning to understand the behavior and vocalization of free-ranging cetaceans. The fortuity of a nonscheduled survey has proven to be beneficial as well. In October 2003 a team of biologist oceanographers began a trip aboard a 44.29 feet catamaran sailing boat from Piraeus Greece to Cape Verde Archipelago intending to observe free-ranging cetaceans. Acoustic recordings were conducted using a towed stereophonic hydrophone array consisted of two Benthos AQ4 type hydrophones. Photographs were taken in order to ensure species identification. Information on vocalization administration during foraging of Lagenodelphis hosei and Steno bredanensis has been acquired. Calculation of ASPL (apparent source power level) revealed that dolphins’ vocalizations did not match to usual vocalization activities. The relation of vocalization administration by dolphins with brain to mash ratio (BMR) is introduced as an additional predator’s strategy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: Identifying foraging variation within a population and assessing its relationship with social structure is essential to increase knowledge about the evolution of social systems. Here, we investigated individual foraging variation in bottlenose dolphins and its potential influence on their social organization. We used generalized affiliation indices and applied social network analysis to data collected over four consecutive years of research in a coastal area subject to significant use and pressure by humans. Our findings revealed variation in foraging behavior among individual bottlenose dolphins, which in turn shapes their social organization. Our results indicated that individuals that frequently foraged within human-altered areas (i.e., shellfish farms) exhibited weaker Strength, Reach, and Affinity compared to others. These bottlenose dolphins profit from a reliable and easily located food source, which may increase their energy intake and interindividual competition. In contrast, individuals that foraged less frequently within the shellfish farms occupied a central position within the network and exhibited strong associations. These individuals may benefit from increased cooperation and reduced intragroup competition, thus increasing learning and information sharing, as they may face a patchy and irregular distribution of prey. We also demonstrated that bottlenose dolphins preferred to affiliate with other individuals with similar foraging strategies (i.e., homophily), which could promote, through time, a segregation of the population into behaviorally distinct groups. These findings provide valuable insight into the evolution of bottlenose dolphin social systems and their response to human-induced changes in the marine environment. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: This study reports historic capture-mark-recapture survival and abundance estimates of common bottle-nose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) based on photoidentification surveys of coastal Venezuela (along the Aragua coast between Turiamo Bay and Puerto Colombia). We used the most recent data available: dolphins identified by unique dorsal fin marks during wet and dry season surveys conducted from 2004 to 2008. Dolphin encounter histories were analyzed in the Closed Capture Robust Design framework, with the top model including random movement, constant survival, and capture-recapture probabilities that varied by secondary periods. Survival of marked adults was estimated at 0.99 (95% CI = 0.97 to 1.00). Population estimates for all adults (marked and unmarked) averaged 31 animals (SD = 13.8), and for all dolphins (all adults and calves), 41 animals (SD = 17.2). Coastal bottlenose dolphins face numerous threats, including ship strikes, oil spills, conflict with recreational and industrial fisheries, other negative human interactions, biotoxins, chemicals, noise, freshwater discharge, and coastal development. Further, small populations are, in general, at increased risk due to reduced resiliency and recovery potential when exposed to such threats and to expected environmental and demographic stochasticity. These historic estimates of abundance and survival are critical for establishing a reference state and indicate a need for ongoing monitoring of the small dolphin population while the Aragua coast is still, as of yet, relatively little impacted by humans. Should coastal development increase (as is the global trend) and/or environmental catastrophes (e.g., harmful algal blooms, hurricanes, and oil spills) occur, these historic estimates will be essential for assessing impacts and guiding management and conservation interventions. Our results show year-round dolphin presence and highlight the Venezuelan coastal-oceanic landscape as an area of both future research and conservation importance. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: The extinct family Squalodontidae consists of heterodont, medium-sized odontocetes, featuring a long rostrum that houses large, procumbent incisors and heavily ornamented postcanine teeth carrying accessory denticles, hence their vernacular name, "shark-toothed dolphins". These longirostri-ne toothed whales are often seen as bridging the anatomical gap between archaic Oligocene odontocetes and their late Miocene to Holocene relatives. Possibly among the major marine predators of their time, the shark-toothed dolphins are important components of several lower Miocene marine-mammal assemblages from the North Atlantic and Mediterranean/Paratethysian realms. In the present work, a partial skull of Squalodontidae is described from the strata of the Bolognano Formation cropping out in the northeastern sector of the Montagna della Majella massif (Abruzzo, central Italy), which has previously yielded a rich lower Miocene marine-vertebrate assemblage, including eleven taxa of elasmobranchs as well as subordinate teleosts and very fragmentary remains of marine reptiles and mammals. The specimen consists of the anterodorsal portion of a rostrum, preserving parts of both pre-maxillae and left maxilla, and the anteriormost seven upper left teeth. This partial skull is here identified as belonging to the genus Squalodon, whose presence in the Montagna della Majella vertebrate assemblage had already been tentatively proposed on the basis of two fragmentary teeth. The paleontological significance of this find is discussed in the broader framework of the Euromediterranean record of Squalodon. © 2020, Carnets de Geologie. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: During the construction of a pipeline from an offshore gas field in northwest Ireland, shore-based watches and opportunistic boat-based photo-identification surveys for bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus were undertaken. Seven years of data were used to investigate the influence of Construction-Related Activity (CRA) on the occurrence of dolphins in the bay where the pipeline made landfall. CRA varied substantially over the seven years and included dredging, pipe-laying, and rock armouring as well as seismic surveys. While individual activities could not be examined in isolation, there was no evidence of aggregated CRA or season influencing occurrence, despite a greater number of CRA days during summer months. There was weak support for the influence of year, but lower occurrence rates did not correspond to years with more CRA days, or vice versa. The uncorrected (marked animals, only) and corrected (accounting for unmarked individuals) annual abundance estimates with the lowest coefficient of variation were 67 (95% CI = 62–84; CV = 0.08) and 140 (95% CI = 106–174; CV = 0.12) in 2010, which was comparable to estimates from a neighbouring region on the west coast of Ireland. Of the well-marked individuals approximately 50% were re-sighted in two or more years and re-sightings within years were as high as 70%. Overall, there was little evidence to suggest that the extended period of CRA resulted in a short- or long-term reduction in the occurrence of dolphins within the bay. However, given the relatively coarse spatial and temporal scale of the CRA data it was not possible to assess fine-scale movements, such as redistribution within the bay in response to CRA within the immediate area. To better inform management and mitigation practices, greater emphasis should be placed on designing robust monitoring programmes that focus beyond fine-scale displacement as the sole indicator of an impact. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Quantifying details of an animal's foraging strategy can provide insight into its energetic requirements, environmental constraints, and other pressures it must balance in behavioral decision-making. Data from ship-based echosounders provided 4888 observations of Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus in the context of heterogeneous prey fields, while an autonomous underwater vehicle carrying similar instruments was used to describe 519 discrete prey patches containing dolphins. We integrated these data with prey net tows, dolphin surface observations, and results from a parallel tagging study that quantified detailed aspects of behavior of 3 indi - viduals. These data provide complementary perspectives on the foraging strategies of Risso's dolphins at a range of time scales from individual prey patch selection to diel cycles. Rather than being solely nocturnal teuthivores as previously suggested, we found that Risso's dolphins dove to depths exceeding 500 m both day and night. Risso's dolphins switched many times daily from being more generalist predators near the surface to specializing on larger squid at depth, commonly within the course of a single 5-10 min dive. Simple energy calculations suggest that shallow prey comprise relatively small contributions to individual energy gains, yet these prey played a strong role in determining the spatio-temporal habitat use of Risso's dolphins. This underscores the importance of examining strategic foraging behavior in light of requirements to access both prey resources and oxygen. The novel integration of multiple complementary sensing methods employed simultaneously on Risso's dolphins provide remarkable insights into the behavioral ecology of individuals and the population. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: The solitary behavior is an unusual and peculiar behavior reported in a few sociable dolphin species. This study presents the solitary behavior of an adult rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis, in the Açu Superport (21º49’S; 041º00’W), northern Rio de Janeiro State, SE Brazil. Data about the dolphin were obtained from mobile phone videos and reports by local professionals. Probably, the same dolphin was there since 2017-2018 up to April 2020 (at least). In general, the solitary dolphin swims next to supply boats navigating along the port internal channel, and it rarely continues towards open sea. The dolphin plays with buoys and containment barriers, rubs itself against hulls, and bow-rides and jumps. There is no report of people swimming with this solitary dolphin, touching it, or offering it food in the Açu Superport. Thus, there seems to be no threats to the animal’s integrity locally. © 2020, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The juvenile period is a challenging life-history stage, especially in species with a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics, such as bottlenose dolphins, where maternal protection is virtually absent. Here, we examined how juvenile male and female bottlenose dolphins navigate this vulnerable period. Specifically, we examined their grouping patterns, activity budget, network dynamics, and social associations in the absence of adults. We found that juveniles live in highly dynamic groups, with group composition changing every 10 min on average. Groups were generally segregated by sex, and segregation was driven by same-sex preference rather than opposite-sex avoidance. Juveniles formed strong associations with select individuals, especially kin and same-sex partners, and both sexes formed cliques with their preferred partners. Sex-specific strategies in the juvenile period reflected adult reproductive strategies, in which the exploration of potential social partners may be more important for males (which form long-term alliances in adulthood) than females (which preferentially associate with kin in adulthood). Females spent more time alone and were more focused on foraging than males, but still formed close same-sex associations, especially with kin. Males cast a wider social net than females, with strong same-sex associations and many male associates. Males engaged in more affiliative behavior than females. These results are consistent with the social bonds and skills hypothesis and suggest that delayed sexual maturity in species with relational social complexity may allow individuals to assess potential associates and explore a complex social landscape without the risks associated with sexual maturity (e.g., adult reproductive competition; inbreeding). © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: On 08 April 2019, a mature female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen, 1833), 185 cm in length (TL), was found dead across the shores of the Mersin Naval Museum, Mersin on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Striped dolphins may accidentally enter the fishing nets, which may be one of the reasons for their death. Although this species has been classified as Vulnerable in the IUCN list, considering the frequency of deaths among this species, the necessity to develop species conservation strategies for the Mediterranean was once again proven by the death of this individual. © 2019, ABADER (Adıyaman Bilimsel Arastırmalar Dernegi).

ABSTRACT: The genus Cephalorhynchus contains four dolphin species, of which three are classified as Near Threatened or Endangered and one subspecies is close to extinction. Understanding the species’ abundance, distributions and habitat preferences is necessary for effective management to prevent further population declines. Heaviside’s dolphin C. heavisidii is endemic to the Benguela ecosystem off southwest Africa, and like other Cephalorhynchus species these dolphins produce narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation clicks with a centroid frequency around 125 kHz. We conducted dedicated visual and acoustic line-transect surveys within and adjacent to the Namibian Islands Marine Protected Area in 2012–2014. Acoustic data were processed in the passive acoustic monitoring software PAMGuard, using the default porpoise click detector and classifier to identify NBHF echolocation clicks. Click detection and classification in PAMGuard included a large excess of false positives, which were easily identified by manual verification of events, and ultimately provided 52 definite detections. The acoustic methods provided data in offshore areas and during overnight periods, but were imperfect and not suitable for ecologically important shallow coastal areas. While demonstrating the utility of passive acoustic monitoring in line-transect surveys targeting Cephalorhynchus species, the study shows that both visual and acoustic methods were needed to collect data throughout the range of Heaviside’s dolphin. © 2020 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bone diseases such as deformations, fractures, bone growths and the fusion of some vertebrae processes in dolphins and other marine mammals have been scarcely reported in Mexico. Here, we report a case of spondyloarthritis in several lumbar vertebrae and the fusion of some processes of the lumbar and caudal vertebrae in a Bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus. The specimen was an adult female (2.39 m total length) found stranded on the West coast of the Statal Reserve Chetumal Bay Manatee Sanctuary. The anomality in the vertebrae of this individual consisted of the fusion of the neural spines of two lumbar vertebrae, the fusion of the arch sheets of two caudal vertebrae and the presence of spondyloarthrosis in several lumbar vertebrae. © 2020 Station Biologique de Roscoff.

ABSTRACT: Pseudaliid lungworms infect the lungs and sinuses of cetaceans. Information on the life cycle and epidemiology of pseudaliids is very scarce and mostly concerns species that infect coastal or inshore cetaceans. Available evidence indicates that some pseudaliids are vertically transmitted to the host, whereas others are acquired via infected prey. We documented pseudaliid infections in an oceanic cetacean, the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the western Mediterranean, and investigated the possibilities of vertical vs. horizontal transmission and the potential influence of host body size, sex, and season on infection levels. We found two species of lungworm in 87 dolphins that stranded along the Spanish Mediterranean coast between 1987 and 2018. One or two larvae of Stenurus ovatus were found in three adult dolphins. Larger numbers of larvae and adults of Skrjabinalius guevarai were collected in 51 dolphins, including unweaned calves. These observations suggested that Skrjabinalius guevarai could be vertically transmitted. The abundance of Skrjabinalius guevarai increased significantly with host size, which suggested that it could be trophically transmitted, as well, with larger hosts consuming more infected prey. Infection levels peaked in spring, outside of the calving season, which is likely a reflection of a seasonal shift in dolphin diet. In summary, results indicate that Skrjabinalius guevarai was capable of both vertical and horizontal transmission, but future research should be directed at clarifying the potential mechanics behind transmission and intermediate hosts. © Wildlife Disease Association 2020.

ABSTRACT: Pollution by heavy metals is becoming a serious threat to food safety and the health of humans and marine animals in many areas, including the Mediterranean Sea. Cadmium and mercury are among the most toxic of these metals. Their presence in various environmental compartments, which is partly due to human activity, inevitably leads to their bioaccumulation in the food chain. In this study, levels of cadmium and mercury were determined by means of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry in liver, kidney and muscle tissues of specimens the dolphinid Stenella coeruleoalba stranded at various locations in coastal areas of the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Sea in Southern Italy from 2015 to 2018. The data were compared with those reported for other Mediterranean locations. Correlations between biometric data (body length, weight and gender) and cadmium and mercury concentrations in tissue samples from these specimens were statistically analyzed in order to investigate the risk that these contaminants may pose to the health of delphinids. Examination of the pattern of contaminants revealed a significantly high concentration of mercury in all the matrices analyzed (liver, kidney and muscle tissue). By contrast, elevated concentrations of cadmium were found only in liver (range: 0.005 - 8.95 mg/kg w.w.) and kidney (range: 0.005 - 34.1 mg/kg w.w.), owing to the accumulator role of these organs during long-term exposure.

ABSTRACT: Toothed whales depend on sound for communication and foraging, making them potentially vulnerable to acoustic masking from increasing anthropogenic noise. Masking effects may be ameliorated by higher amplitudes or rates of calling, but such acoustic compensation mechanisms may incur energetic costs if sound production is expensive. The costs of whistling in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have been reported to be much higher (20% of resting metabolic rate, RMR) than theoretical predictions (0.5–1% of RMR). Here, we address this dichotomy by measuring the change in the resting O2 consumption rate (V O2), a proxy for RMR, in three post-absorptive bottlenose dolphins during whistling and silent trials, concurrent with simultaneous measurement of acoustic output using a calibrated hydrophone array. The experimental protocol consisted of a 2-min baseline period to establish RMR, followed by a 2-min voluntary resting surface apnea, with or without whistling as cued by the trainers, and then a 5-min resting period to measure recovery costs. Daily fluctuations in V O2 were accounted for by subtracting the baseline RMR from the recovery costs to estimate the cost of apnea with and without whistles relative to RMR. Analysis of 52 sessions containing 1162 whistles showed that whistling did not increase metabolic cost (P>0.1, +4.2±6.9%) as compared with control trials (−0.5±5.9%; means±s.e.m.). Thus, we reject the hypothesis that whistling is costly for bottlenose dolphins, and conclude that vocal adjustments such as the Lombard response to noise do not represent large direct energetic costs for communicating toothed whales. © 2020.

ABSTRACT: The efficacy of Bay leaf (Laurus nobilis) essential oil (LnEO) as a herbal anesthetic agent was evaluated with 2-Phenoxyethanol (2-PE) in Blue Dolphin Cichlid, Cyrtocara moorii. Fish were exposed to different anesthetic concentrations and the lowest effective concentrations (LECs) were determined according to deep anesthesia (AD<3 min) and full recovery (RF<5 min) times. LnEO showed anesthetic properties, and all applied concentrations of both agents induced AD in C. moorii. The LECs of LnEO and 2-PE for C. moorii were determined as 800 µl L-1 (AD; RF → 183 ± 6.3 s; 191 ± 2.6 s) and 600 µl L-1 (AD; RF → 171 ± 3.2 s; 239 ± 4.9 s), respectively. Significant differences were found between anesthetic agents in terms of deep anesthesia and full recovery times for the same concentrations (p<0.05). Induction and recovery times decreased with increasing in LnEO concentrations. On the other hand, anesthesia times were decreased with increasing of 2-PE concentrations, while recovery times increased. Induction and recovery times for LnEO were significantly dependent on concentrations and positive relationships were recorded between AD and RF, whereas the relationship was negative in 2-PE. Bay leaf essential oil has not been used as an anesthetic agent in fish until now. Our results showed that LnEO was an effective anesthetic agent with some minor side effects on C. moorii. © 2020, Israeli Journal of Aquaculture - Bamidgeh. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Fungal infections that affect marine mammals, like most fungal infections, can be secondary to environmental stress or other infectious diseases. This article describes a case of pulmonary infection by Aspergillus spp. in a specimen of Pontoporia blainvillei found dead near the town of San Clemente de Tuyu and near the bay of Samborombón, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The lung was collapsed with necrotic foci, fragments were collected, fixed in 10% formalin and submitted to histopathological examination. Microscopically, a marked change of the pulmonary architecture was observed, with total alveolar collapse, extensive necrotic areas, where septal hyphae were observed weakly, when stained with H-E and clearly evidenced with Grocott staining. Since the potential causes of immunosuppression were not evident, the authors consider it probable that infection by Aspergillus spp. was established in the lungs that presented a primary, possibly bacterial pneumonia, as a result of some degree of immunosuppression. © 2020, Brazilian Association of Veterinary Pathology.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about the ecology of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) inhabiting the coastal waters of tropical north-western Australia. We used photo-identification data collected between 2013 and 2015, site fidelity indexes and capture-recapture models to estimate the abundance and site fidelity patterns of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (T. aduncus) inhabiting the coastal waters off the North West Cape (NWC), Western Australia. A standardized site fidelity index (SSFI) indicated low site fidelity (SSFI = 0.019) at the population level to the 130 km2 study area. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) of individual re-sight rates classified 58% of individuals as “non-residents.” Open POPAN modeling estimated a super-population size of 311 (95% CI: 249–373) individuals over the study period. A maximum likelihood transient model which considers both resident and non-resident individuals in a population, estimated a resident population of 141 (95% CI: 121–161) individuals and a super-population of 370 (95% CI: 333–407) individuals. These models indicate that a large population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins of relatively high density (an average of 2.4–2.8 bottlenose dolphins per km2) inhabits the waters off the NWC. The large number of both resident and non-resident bottlenose dolphins found throughout the coastal waters off the NWC suggest this area, as well as neighboring waters outside our study area, are of high importance to this species. © Copyright © 2020 Haughey, Hunt, Hanf, Rankin and Parra.

ABSTRACT: Current abundance estimates for populations of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) in bays, sounds, and estuaries are lacking throughout most of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), including areas of Texas and western Louisiana. To address this issue, we conducted 92 small-boat photographic identification surveys covering ∼2000 km2 and comprising ∼11,000 km of track-line in winter and summer seasons in West Bay, TX (2014-2015, n = 25), the Galveston Bay, TX system (2016, n = 50), Sabine Lake, TX (2017, n = 17), and adjacent coastal waters. Individual dolphin encounter histories were constrained by spatiotemporal parameters to approximately represent 1) a "Bay" estimate of individuals limited to the interior of each embayment, and 2) a "Selective" estimate of the number of individuals in each survey area (including nearshore coastal waters), filtered for potential transient dolphins. Using the Selective dataset, estimated bottlenose dolphins (95% CI) were (winter and summer, respectively) 38 (29-47) and 37 (33-40) for West Bay, 842 (694-990) and 1,132 (846-1,417) for Galveston Bay, and 122 (73-170) and 162 (114-210) for Sabine Lake. A range of 4-15% of marked individuals in each study area were identified as inter-bay matches. These results provide new insights on the potential spatial range of each population, update previous abundance estimates for West Bay and Galveston Bay, and contribute novel population information for Sabine Lake and adjacent coastal waters of the northwestern GOM. © 2020 University of Southern MIssissippi.

ABSTRACT: The Atlantic humpback dolphin remains an understudied, critically endangered cetacean species. Here, we describe the first complete mitogenome of Sousa teuszii, derived from an animal stranded on Île des Oiseaux, Sine Saloum, Senegal. The S. teuszii mitogenome is composed of 16,384 base pairs and is 98.1% identical to its closest relative with a mitogenome, Sousa chinensis. Phylogenetic analysis confirms its placement with S. chinensis, as well as the placement of the genus Sousa within subfamily Delphininae. © 2019, © 2019 Smithsonian Institution.

ABSTRACT: No conservation agreement works in isolation. In NW European seas there are several other pieces of legislation that have come into force to protect the marine environment. Most notable of these are the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives, the Oslo and Paris Convention (OSPAR) and the Helsinki Convention (HELCOM). This chapter reviews their history and development, and how they relate to cetacean conservation. Comparisons are then made with cetacean legislative agreements in other parts of the world, starting with the sister agreement of UNEP's Convention on Migratory Species, ACCOBAMS, that applies to the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and then to others: the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that applies globally, and Marine Mammal Protection Acts and related legislation in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The strengths and limitations of these are reviewed, with a view to making the ASCOBANS Agreement more effective. © 2020 Peter G.H. Evans Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Blubber has been proposed as a possible alternative to blood in the assessment of endocrine physiology in marine mammals because it can be collected via remote biopsy, which removes some of the confounding variables and logistical constraints associated with blood collection. To date, few studies have directly assessed the relationships between circulating versus blubber steroid hormone profiles in marine mammals, and these studies have been limited to a small subset of steroid hormones, which collectively limit the current utility of blubber steroid hormone measurements. In this study, we used liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to screen for 16 steroid hormones in matched blood and blubber samples from free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Seven steroid hormones were detected and quantified, including two progestogens, two androgens, and three corticosteroids. Using principal components analysis (PCA), we explored relationships between hormones in both matrices and three physiological states: sexual maturity, pregnancy, and acute stress response. Plasma and blubber testosterone and its precursors, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione, loaded to the first principal component (PC1), and PC1 scores were higher in mature males. Plasma and blubber progesterone loaded to PC2, and pregnant/probable pregnant females had significantly higher PC2 scores. Pregnant females also had higher PC1 scores than other females, suggesting differences in androgen profiles between these groups. There was disagreement between plasma and blubber corticosteroid profiles, as indicated by their loading to different PCs; plasma corticosteroids loaded to PC3 and blubber corticosteroids to PC4. PC3 scores were significantly predicted by elapsed time to blood collection (i.e., time between initiating the capture process and blood collection), while elapsed time to blubber collection significantly predicted PC4 scores, indicating that corticosteroid profiles shift in both tissues during acute stress. Corticosteroid profiles were not related to demographic group, site-month, body mass index, water temperature, or time spent outside of the water on the processing boat. Overall, these results demonstrate that blubber steroid hormone profiles reflect changes in endocrine function that occur over broad temporal scales. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Aquatic species such as bottlenose dolphins can move in 3 dimensions and frequently view objects from different orientations. This study examined their ability to identify 2-D objects visually despite changes in orientation across 2 rotation planes. A dolphin performed a matching-to-sample task in which a sample was presented at a different orientation from its match in a 3-alternative choice array. Samples were presented at 6 aspect angles in the picture plane (0°, ±45°, ±135°, 180°) and 6 aspect angles in the depth plane (0°, −45°, ±90°, +135°, 180°). Alternatives were always presented at 0°. Performance was significantly better than chance for all aspect angles in both rotation plane tests. There was a significant linear decline in accuracy as the sample object was rotated from 0° toward 180° in the picture plane. Performance with familiar objects (M = 97.1%) exceeded performance with novel objects (M = 76.9%). In the depth plane rotation test, there was a significant quadratic trend in accuracy as the sample object was rotated from 0° toward 180°, in which performance was significantly lower at ±90° than at all other orientations. Performance in the picture plane where all object features were available irrespective of orientation was significantly better than performance in the depth plane where the availability of visible features were dependent upon orientation (M = 81.2% vs. M = 63.0%). The dolphin’s performance in this study shows evidence of both viewpoint-independent and viewpoint-dependent processes.

ABSTRACT: Theodolite tracking observations of Hector’s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) and boat activity were conducted from cliff-side 30 m above sea level within a defined study site in Akaroa Harbour, South Island, New Zealand from 5 January 1999 to 12 February 1999 and from 6 January 2000 to 14 February 2000. Data were compiled and analysed to assess whether there were changes in dolphin distribution, or behaviour, due to boat activity. A total of 232 hours and 48 minutes of observations were made that covered 1369 boats and 2620 dolphin groups. Recreational boats were the most common boat type observed, comprising 64.1% in 1999 and 58.5% in 2000 of the total boat activity observed; however, recreational boats comprised only 1% and 2% respectively of total boat observations that were associated with dolphins. Dolphins were most commonly associated with kayak groups during both observation periods. The dolphin behaviour ‘swimming’ was significantly correlated with increasing boat density. Overall, dolphin density in the study area was independent of boat density and dolphin group size did not change with boat presence. Fourteen multi-boat events were observed where two or more boats in close proximity to each other were associated with the same group of dolphins. Included are observations of dolphin/boat/people interactions in Akaroa Harbour, a note on two calf mortalities in 1999 (possibly caused by boat strikes) a note on four beach-cast dolphins in 2000, and management and research recommendations. © December 2001, Department of Conservation.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic noise has received much attention as a potential factor affecting the behavior of marine mammals. For behavioral responses to occur, a sound stimulus would have to be a certain number of decibels (dB) above noise levels and the animal's audiogram. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have good hearing sensitivity in the mid-to high-frequency range (15 to 50 kHz). Thus, in tins stud)", two captive bottlenose dolphins housed in a floating pen were subjected to three tonal signals of 15, 20, and 50 kHz with the same signal durations and duty cycles. The effect of each signal was judged by comparing the dolphins' surfacing locations, number of surfacings, and number of echolocation clicks during test periods with those during baseline periods. The location of the sound source did not change during the study. The results showed that the two dolphins swam away from the sound source and came up to the surface more often, but the dolphins exhibited a slight degree of habituation to the sounds. The two dolphins produced fewer echolocation clicks when the three signals were produced. The average avoidance threshold sound pressure level (SPL) of bottlenose dolphins for the three test signals were approximately 65,70, and 83 dB above the hearing threshold SPL, respectively. © 2020 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The topography of ganglion cells in the retina of three neonatal bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus has been studied in retinal wholemounts. Two areas of high ganglion cell density have been identified in the form of local spots in the temporal and nasal quadrants of the retina, near a horizontal diameter at a distance of 10–15 mm from the optical disk. The maximum density of ganglion cells in these areas on average for five preparations is 657 and 636 cells/mm2 in the temporal and nasal quadrants, respectively. The retinal resolution, estimated by the maximum density of ganglion cells and a posterior nodal distance of 13 mm, was 0.17° for the temporal quadrant and 0.18° for the nasal one. These data are comparable with the results for the previously studied adult dolphin and whale species. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to assess the prey species and foraging behaviour of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dol-phins (Tursiops aduncus) around Mikura Island, a small oceanic island ~200 km south of Tokyo, Japan, using underwater observations and stom-ach content analysis of eight individuals to deter-mine the feeding ecology of this population. Our results suggest that T. aduncus feed on various species and exhibit concentrated foraging behav-iour at night. We recorded 11 fish species, seven cephalopod species, and one crustacean species as prey, as well as 10 fish species and one crustacean species as potential prey. Our underwater obser-vations revealed that females performed foraging behaviour during daytime significantly more fre-quently than males. This is the first study using underwater observations to assess foraging and prey species of small cetaceans in Japan. © (2020), (Western Illinois University). All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Many gregarious species require complex patterns of communication for maintaining coordinated behaviors, articulated social structure and group cohesion. In mammal species, social complexity has been considered the driving force for the development of advanced acoustic communication systems. Striped dolphins are highly social, showing large group size with females maintaining strong bonds with kin. Here, we tested the hypothesis that more complex acoustic pattern plays a key role in social activity in the striped dolphins. The production rate of clicks, whistles and burst pulses, and the acoustic features of whistles have been related to the activity context (feeding, traveling, resting, and socializing). Furthermore, complex calls, consisting of a combination of frequency-modulated, and/or pulsed components were detected. Higher whistles and burst pulses production rates were recorded during socializing. Also, the social activity can be discriminated basing on the modulation of the whistle contour. Biphonic calls were especially recorded during social interaction events, suggesting that these phenomena can encode information about individual or group identity to conspecifics. Outcomes indicate the pivotal role of vocal complexity during social context and elicit further investigations of the communication system of small odontocetes from local to wider spatial scale. © 2020, Frontiers Media S.A..

ABSTRACT: The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) is a small odontocete distributed from Santa Catarina state, Brazil, to Honduras. Although it is currently considered “near threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, considerable knowledge on health and disease aspects of this species has been gained over the last decade. The main threats for the species are represented by multiple anthropic factors. Guiana dolphins feed on a variety of taxa, primarily teleosts, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Herein, we reported a case of severe laryngeal displacement and esophageal impaction with ulceration associated with a deglutted adult leatherjacket (Oligoplites sp.). This fish species is not a common prey item of Guiana dolphins’ diet. Severe upper aerodigestive compromise likely led to death by mechanical asphyxia (choke) in this dolphin. This report attested the occurrence of upper aerodigestive dysfunction due to overzealous feeding in Guiana dolphin and contributed to general knowledge on pathology of the species. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

ABSTRACT: Context: In competitive swimming, many swimmers experience low back pain (LBP). Lumbar hyperextension may cause LBP, and tight hip-flexor muscle may cause lumbar extension during swimming. Objective: The purpose of this study was to clarify the features of the elastic moduli of the muscles and the lumbar extension when swimmers with LBP perform a dolphin kick (DK). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Single center. Other Participants: Eleven male college swimmers were enrolled as the LBP group (who have LBP when swimming and during a lumbar extension), and 21 male college swimmers were recruited as the control group (no LBP). Interventions: The elastic moduli of the psoas major, iliacus, teres major, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, and pectoralis minor were measured through ultrasonic shear wave elastography. The lumbar and hip extension angles during a DK were measured using a video camera. The passive hip extension and shoulder-flexion range of motion (ROM) were measured using a goniometer. Main Outcome Measures: Muscle elastic moduli and lumbar extension angles during DK. Results: The characteristics, muscle elastic moduli, DK motion, and ROM were compared between the 2 groups. LBP group demonstrated significantly higher elastic modulus of the psoas major and lower modulus of pectoralis minor compared with the control group. Also, LBP group showed greater lumbar extension during a DK and less hip extension ROM than the control group. Conclusions: The higher elastic modulus of the psoas major and greater lumbar extension during a DK may be related to the LBP in swimmers. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This report provides insights into the behavioural ecology of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in Mercury Bay, on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island, New Zealand. The report also includes a preliminary assessment of the influence of tourism activity on common dolphins in the area. From 1998 to 2001 (excluding the austral winter months May to September) we conducted 166 boat-based surveys, resulting in 102 ‘focal group follows’, with 118.2 hours spent observing common dolphins. In Mercury Bay common dolphins showed a geographical movement associated with seasonal changes. The dolphins were found further inshore in spring and increasingly offshore through summer and during autumn. Anecdotal reports suggest continued offshore movement over winter. However, re-sightings of identifiable dolphins indicate movement of individuals between Mercury Bay and the Hauraki Gulf to the north and west (by sea) and between Mercury Bay and the waters off Whakatane to the south. Data revealed that common dolphins spent 57% of their daylight time traveling, 21.5% milling, 13% feeding, 8% socialising, and 0.5% resting. Common dolphins were observed to prey on at least six different species of fish. Boat traffic altered the behaviour of some dolphin groups, especially those containing few individuals; however, low-level commercial tourism appeared to have little impact on the dolphins. Few attempts at swimming with common dolphins resulted in a sustained interaction. This information about Mercury Bay common dolphins will be useful for comparative purposes as recreational and tourism activity increases in the future. © July 2005, New Zealand Department of Conservation.

ABSTRACT: An algorithm for detecting tonal vocalizations from estuarine dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) specimens without interference of a human operator was developed. The raw audio data collected from a passive monitoring sensor in the Cananéia underwater soundscape was converted to spectrogram images. Detection is a four-step method: first, ridge maps are obtained from the spectrogram images; second, a probabilistic Hough transform algorithm is applied to detect ridges similar to thick line segments, referred to as line-like, which are adjusted to the geometry of the whistles in the images via an active contour algorithm; third, feature vectors are built from the geometry of each detected whistle, with 9 descriptive features; and fourth, the detections are fed to a random forest classifier to parse out mistakes by the detection process. We developed a system for classifying the characteristic patterns detected as Sotalia guianensis whistles or random empty detections. We obtained accuracy of 0.977 and F1-score of 0.981. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are ecosystem sentinels. In the Gulf of California, Mexico, they are found in areas that overlap with human activities, as in the case of the Ensenada de La Paz lagoon. A custom-made recorder -moored at medium depth (2.0 m) in the entrance to the lagoon- recorded acoustic data from June to November 2017 (8 deployments; 293 h). Whistles -an indicative of bottlenose dolphin presences- were pooled over time to acquire acoustic encounters, which were analysed to infer continuity of animal presence and test for statistically significant differences between deployments, day and night, and hours. Whistles were recorded during all deployments and evidenced night-time presence of bottlenose dolphins in the lagoon. Significant differences of acoustic encounters were observed between ‘Jun-Jul’ and ‘Sep-Nov’. Acoustic encounters were higher at night but were not different at an hourly level. Acoustical data proved the continuous presence of bottlenose dolphins, highlighting the importance of the Ensenada de La Paz for their population. This initial study highlights the usefulness of long-term passive acoustic monitoring to inform stake holders involved in management and conservation plans. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Due to their long life-span and top trophic position, odontocetes can accumulate high concentrations of mercury (Hg) in their tissues. This study measured the concentration of total Hg (THg) in the blubber and skin of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that stranded along the Florida (FL) panhandle and Louisiana (LA) coasts and investigated the relationship between total Hg (THg) concentration and sex, body length, age, stranding location, diet/trophic position (δ13C and δ15N, respectively), and foraging habitat (δ34S). Additionally, we compared models using body length and age as explanatory variables to determine which was a better predictor of THg concentration. In both tissues, sex was not an influential predictor of THg concentration and there was a positive relationship between body length/age and THg concentration (p < 0.001). Florida dolphins had greater mean blubber and skin THg concentrations compared to LA dolphins (p < 0.001). There was a modest improvement in model fit when age was used in place of body length. δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S differed between stranding locations and together with age were significant predictors of THg concentrations (R2 = 0.52, P < 0.001). Florida dolphins were δ13C enriched compared to LA dolphins (p < 0.001) and THg concentrations were positively correlated with δ13C (R2 = 0.22, p < 0.001). Our results demonstrate spatial variability in THg concentrations from stranded bottlenose dolphins from the northern Gulf of Mexico; however, future research is required to understand how fine-scale population structuring of dolphins within FL and LA impacts THg concentrations, particularly among inshore (bay, sound, and estuary) stocks and between inshore and offshore stocks, as variations in biotic and abiotic conditions can influence both stable isotope ratios and THg concentrations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This long-term project provides the first look at serial prolactin concentrations in the female bottle-nose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) during known reproductive states using non-invasive urine sampling. Prolactin concentrations were detectable during anestrus, estrous, pregnancy, lactation, and when non-mothers cohabitate with mother–calf dyads. Prolactin concentrations were higher during pregnancy than during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle indicating a possible role in pregnancy maintenance. A prolactin rise at the end of gestation suggests an involvement in pre-parturition mammary gland development, and concentrations were higher in months 1 through 5 of lactation vs months 15 through 18. Prolactin concentrations were found to be elevated in both nulliparous and parous non-mothers when they cohabitated with mother–newborn dyads, and lactational anestrous was observed. Spontaneous lactation occurred in a nulliparous female when cohabitating with a mother–newborn calf dyad that was positively correlated with elevated prolactin concentrations. There was no positive correlation between northern meteorological seasons and prolactin concentrations suggesting that dolphins may not use photoperiod in reproduction regulation as is observed in horses and sheep. Methodologies such as mammary gland ultrasound and testing urinary prolactin in pregnant females to help predict healthy vs unhealthy pregnancies could be used by field researchers conducting wild dolphin health assessments. This information is of particular importance when investigating the long-term effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on bottlenose dolphin reproduction in the Gulf of Mexico. © 2020.

ABSTRACT: Despite dedicated longitudinal studies, lack of information on ranging patterns of “resident” dolphins can limit our ability to apply conservation directives at the appropriate scale. Herein, we present satellite-linked telemetry data on movements over 108 days (1,067 Argos locations) for an adult male Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) in The Bahamas. This individual (“Lamda”) has been known to researchers in the Bimini area since 2010 and was seen there wild swimming on 7 August 2018. On 26 August 2018, Lamda live-stranded in the Berry Islands, approximately 110 km east of Bimini. Lamda was transported to Dolphin Cay in Nassau on 30 August where he was diagnosed with pneumonia, gastric ulceration, gastritis, myopathy, and dehydration. On 29 October 2018, Lamda was airlifted to the Bimini area, instrumented with a SPOT6 Finmount location-only satellite-linked tag, and released. He travelled rapidly south, covering 410 km in 48 hours, stopping near Cuba, well beyond what was previously considered his normal range. Lamda stayed in this southern area (3,572 km2) for 13 days, but there were no opportunities to document behaviors or potential associations with other dolphins. Over the next 16 days, Lamda traveled back to Bimini; and on 7 January 2019, he was observed in a group with other known Atlantic spotted dolphins. He remained in the Bimini area (1,203 km2) until his tag stopped transmitting on 14 February 2019 and has since been seen 24 times near Bimini, through the end of August 2019. Assuming Lamda’s movements are representative of ranging patterns by non-rehabilitated dolphins, these data provide insights that have important implications for the conservation of this species. Notably, the majority of Lamda’s locations were in the Bimini area where there is pressure from increasing tourism, and his locations in the southern area overlap with existing petroleum licenses where test drilling is scheduled. © 2020

ABSTRACT: In the Amazon and Orinoco basins, mercury has been released from artisanal and industrial gold mining since the Colonial time, as well as a result of deforestation and burning of primary forest, that release natural deposits of methyl mercury, affecting the local aquatic vertebrate fauna. This study reports the presence of mercury in river dolphins’ genera Inia and Sotalia. Mercury concentrations were analysed in muscle tissue samples collected from 46 individuals at the Arauca and Orinoco Rivers (Colombia), the Amazon River (Colombia), a tributary of the Itenez River (Bolivia) and from the Tapajos River (Brazil). Ranges of total mercury (Hg) concentration in muscle tissue of the four different taxa sampled were: I. geoffrensis humboldtiana 0.003–3.99 mg kg−1 ww (n = 21, Me = 0.4), I. g. geoffrensis 0.1–2.6 mg kg−1 ww (n = 15, Me = 0.55), I. boliviensis 0.03–0.4 mg kg−1 ww (n = 8, Me = 0.1) and S. fluviatilis 0.1–0.87 mg kg−1 ww (n = 2, Me = 0.5). The highest Hg concentration in our study was obtained at the Orinoco basin, recorded from a juvenile male of I. g. humboldtiana (3.99 mg kg−1 ww). At the Amazon basin, higher concentrations of mercury were recorded in the Tapajos River (Brazil) from an adult male of I. g. geoffrensis (2.6 mg kg−1 ww) and the Amazon River from an adult female of S. fluviatilis (0.87 mg kg−1 ww). Our data support the presence of total Hg in river dolphins distributed across the evaluated basins, evidencing the role of these cetaceans as sentinel species and bioindicators of the presence of this heavy metal in natural aquatic environments. © 2019, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma gondii is a cosmopolitan zoonotic parasite and nowadays considered as an emerging neozoan pathogen in the marine environment. Cetacean innate immune reactions against T. gondii stages have not yet been investigated. Thus, T. gondii tachyzoites were utilized to trigger neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Scanning electron microscopy unveiled T. gondii tachyzoites as potent and rapid inducers of cetacean-derived NETosis. Co-localization of extracellular chromatin with global histones, granulocytic myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase confirmed classical characteristics of NETosis. Interestingly, different phenotypes of NETs were induced by tachyzoites resulting in spread, diffuse and aggregated NET formation and moreover, ‘anchored’ and ‘cell free’ NETosis was also detected. Current data indicate that cetacean-derived NETosis might represent an early, ancient and well-conserved host innate defense mechanism that not only acts against T. gondii but might also occur in response to other closely related emerging apicomplexan parasites affecting marine cetaceans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The two extant genera of strictly freshwater dolphins Inia and Platanista are the result of convergent evolution to freshwater environments with reduced visibility. Characterized by their long snout and small melon, these extant taxa are clustered into two clades, Iniidae in South America and Platanistidae in Southern Asia. Their evolutionary history leading to freshwater environments remains mostly unknown, because many of their related fossil species have been found in marine environments. Here, we report riverine dolphin remains (two rostral fragments and a periotic) from two stratigraphic levels of the late middle Miocene (ca. 12.5 Ma) from La Venta, Colombia. The periotic has a reduced cochlear aqueduct mediodorsally oriented, the anterior process is relatively thin, and the dorsal opening of the facial canal is located lateral to the spiral cribriform tract. The rostral fragments are dorsoventrally flattened; the mandible features two longitudinal ventral grooves, and the premaxilla-maxilla suture of the rostrum is located in a deep lateral groove. These characteristics indicate that the specimens belong to Platanistidae, the lineage of the Ganges river dolphin Platanista. Platanistids had also been recorded on coeval strata from the Fitzcarrald arch, Peru. The occurrence of middle Miocene platanistids in both the La Venta and Fiztcarrald localities suggests that members of this lineage moved into freshwater environments in South America earlier than the ancestors of the modern Amazon river dolphin Inia. The subsequent collapse of the Pebas ecosystem could have played a role in the extinction of non-marine Platanistoidea in South America. © 2020, by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: Including the ultrasound examination as part of the active medical screening in dolphins has become a routine in the last years. This technique provides relevant data on the echoanatomy, echostructure and echogenity of the examined organs, finding its usefulness in the diagnosis of many diseases of the abdominal cavity, but also in the diagnosis of gestation. The ecographic evaluation was carried out on 2 dolphins, species Tursiops truncatus, within the Natural Sciences Museum Complex Constanta. The data collected by the transducer had great value in providing very important diag-nostic information about developing a pathological process captured prior to clinical manifestations. © 2020, Scibulcom Ltd..

ABSTRACT: Comics is a medium for transporting messages and information in a very direct and efficient way, since it is primarily based on visual information, which may be extremely reduced and focused. This makes it not only suitable especially for children, but also for adult people. Although comic magazines once have been considered as “junk”, comics today has gained enormous reputation, which is evidenced by the large number of high-level graphic novels on the market. “The bottlenose dolphin” is a short comic attempting to send an ecological message to the (young) reader. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: The reproductive output of wild bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus has exten-sively been investigated; nevertheless, it remains widely unexplored in the Mediterranean Sea. We investigated the reproductive history of female bottlenose dolphins in the Aeolian Archipelago (Italy). Thirteen years of photo-identification data were used to track the reproductive pattern of 7 females and their 16 calves. The birth period was accurately estimated within 1 mo for 6 calves (37.5%), peaking in June/July. The mean number of calves for females was 2.3 ± 1.1 (SD), ranging from 1 to 4. The mean interbirth interval was 3.5 ± 1.6 yr, ranging from 2 to 7 yr. The mean weaning age was 3.2 ± 0.6 yr, although 1 calf may have been weaned as late as its fifth birthday. Mother−calf postweaning associations were tracked for 9 calves and ranged from 4 to 10 yr of res-idence in the maternal group of the calf. The age of first pregnancy was 7.5 yr. The number of calves was influenced by the mean maternal group size, with females that were sighted in larger groups having more calves. However, the number of calves was not influenced by the strength of the associations of mothers with other females. Calf mortality by age 1 was high (12.5%). Two juveniles also died postweaning within 6 yr of their birth. Finally, 2 females may have died during the study, as they were not re-sighted at the end of the study. Our results highlight the need to implement urgent conservation actions to protect this bottlenose dolphin population. © 2020, Inter-Research. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Toothed whales have evolved flexible biosonar systems to find, track and capture prey in diverse habitats. Delphinids, phocoenids and iniids adjust inter-click intervals and source levels gradually while approaching prey. In contrast, deep-diving beaked and sperm whales maintain relatively constant inter-click intervals and apparent output levels during the approach followed by a rapid transition into the foraging buzz, presumably to maintain a long-range acoustic scene in a multi-target environment. However, it remains unknown whether this rapid biosonar adjustment strategy is shared by delphinids foraging in deep waters. To test this, we investigated biosonar adjustments of a deep-diving delphinid, the Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus). We analyzed inter-click interval and apparent output level adjustments recorded from sound recording tags to quantify in situ sensory adjustment during prey capture attempts. Risso’s dolphins did not follow typical (20logR) biosonar adjustment patterns seen in shallow-water species, but instead maintained stable repetition rates and output levels up to the foraging buzz. Our results suggest that maintaining a long-range acoustic scene to exploit complex, multi-target prey layers is a common strategy amongst deep-diving toothed whales. Risso’s dolphins transitioned rapidly into the foraging buzz just like beaked whales during most foraging attempts, but employed a more gradual biosonar adjustment in a subset (19%) of prey approaches. These were characterized by higher speeds and minimum specific acceleration, indicating higher prey capture efforts associated with evasive prey. Thus, tracking and capturing evasive prey using biosonar may require a more gradual switch between multi-target echolocation and single-target tracking. © 2020 Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: People living in coastal communities are at risk for exposure to environmental hazards, including legacy chemicals. We can use databases such as NHANES to assess whether contaminants in coastal communities are present in higher levels than in the United States overall. We can use information from studies of local animal populations to assess which of these contaminants could have been transferred to people from their shared environment. Objective: Our objectives were to examine the POP profiles in human populations in areas where there are published POP profiles in resident dolphins and to compare our results with data from NHANES and the dolphin studies. Methods: We identified three areas where POPs have been analyzed in local resident dolphin populations (total N = 73). We identified human communities in the same areas, and asked 27 eligible adults to read and sign a consent form, complete a questionnaire about demographics and seafood consumption, provide nine 10-mL blood samples, and provide one sample of seafood (N = 33). Blood and seafood were analyzed for a suite of POPs similar to those analyzed in published dolphin population studies. We compared the results from human blood analyses with NHANES and with data from the published reports of dolphin studies. Results: Levels and proportions of specific POPs found in people and animals reflect POPs found in the local environment. Compared with the nationally representative data reported in NHANES, the levels of many POPs found in high levels in dolphins were also higher in the corresponding human communities. Conclusions: Contaminants measured in marine animals, such as dolphins, can be used to identify the types and relative levels of environmental contaminants expected to occur in people sharing the same environment. Likewise, contaminants measured in coastal human populations can provide insight into which contaminants may be found in nearby animal populations. © 2019

ABSTRACT: This study was aimed to estimate the body mass of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins through photogrammetric techniques. Dolphins are animal listed in Appendix 2 according to Convention on International Trade in Endangered of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which must be considered for its sustainability. Poor management of dolphins will causes stress. Morphometrics measurements need to be done to see the body condition of the dolphin. The data used are Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins that are captived in the Bali sea under professionally managed care. Dolphins are photographed with lateral and ventral position. Photographs result will be measured at a lateral position with lateral lengths, L1, L2, L3, and L4. Measurement at the ventral position are ventral lengths, D1, D2, D3, and D4. The measurement data obtained by reading with ImageJ then calibrated and analyzed with simple linear regression. From the results of regression analysis of dolphins weighted in the lateral position with L2 has a value (R2 = 0.984) and lateral position with D2 (R2 = 0.958). © EM International.

ABSTRACT: Testicular neoplasms have been extensively described and characterized in domestic animals, but reports in wildlife species, including marine mammals, are scarce. This case report describes a testicular seminoma in an adult striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba stranded along the coasts of the Canary Islands. Post-mortem computerized tomography (CT) showed a prominent enlargement of the cranial pole of the right testicle, displacing the intestinal loops. Necropsy gross findings confirmed the presence of a testicular mass, bulging at the cut surface, with multiple well-delimitated whitish nodular lesions. Histologically, intratubular and diffuse neoplastic germinative cell proliferation was described. Complementary immunohistochemical assessments for vimentin and CD117 antibodies were negative. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first seminoma described in a S. coeruleoalba. We suggest that post-mortem (PM) pre-necropsy CT in dolphins is a useful tool for anatomic-guided pathology in such cases.  © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Our study aims to assess the population connectivity, evolutionary history, and conservation status of the short-beaked common dolphin in the Black Sea and Turkish Straits System (TSS). We also include DNA sequences from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to provide a regional perspective to our localized study. Analysis of 366 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA D-loop fragments from 37 samples collected from short-beaked common dolphins in the Black Sea, TSS, and Aegean Sea revealed 13 haplotypes, eight of which have not been previously reported. While analysis of samples archived on GenBank revealed 89 different haplotypes across the region. The haplotype network contains two main peripheral groups that include individuals from all locations. Haplotypes from the Atlantic Ocean are scattered across the network and no obvious population separation was detected. Some shared haplotypes potentially indicate multi-directional colonization events of the Mediterranean Sea from the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, some less widely distributed haplotypes suggest some level of more recent genetic connectivity through the Strait of Gibraltar and the TSS and point out the importance of these straits in the dispersal of short-beaked common dolphins. The haplotype and nucleotide diversity values were lower in the Black Sea, TSS, and western Mediterranean Sea when compared to the Atlantic Ocean, supporting the expansion of Atlantic populations into the Mediterranean and the Black Seas. Differentiation was observed between the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea, TSS and the Black Sea based on Фst but not between Mediterranean and the Black Seas. For common dolphins, which have high dispersal potential, the protection of open seas and narrow seaways to enhance connectivity may be crucial. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of social behavior at an individual level is central to our understanding of complex mammalian societies. In this study, we analyzed the fine-scale sociality of wild bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, by examining associations between members of the whole population and between specific female and male dolphins. We carried out 51 boat-based individual focal follows on 18 identifiable bottlenose dolphins over 90.8 hr (39 days) between 2014 and 2016. Additionally, we conducted 353 boat-based surveys (with 607 sightings) between 2012 and 2015, and identified 121 distinct adult/juvenile dolphins. The mean group size of focal dolphin groups was 7.2 ± 4.1 (range = 1–20) and the mean fission-fusion rate was 3.06 ± 1.35 changes/hr. The most frequent composition of within-group affiliate pairs was female–male. Focal males spent more time with female nearest-neighbors than male nearest-neighbors (p =.013). Differences between female and male activity budgets were not strongly supported (p =.13). There was no evidence for male alliance formation in the Shannon Estuary population, and all of the known-sex top-ranked associates (7) of known males (n = 10) were females. This research reveals a distinct bottlenose dolphin society with female–male affiliations and an absence of male alliances. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Ecotourism has seen both demand and attention increase globally and locally. Dolphin watching tours, as a type of nature-based activity, have become popular in Tai O of Hong Kong. However, little attention has been paid to the quality and pricing of the tour operators in relation to the expectations of visitors. This study seeks to understand the willingness to pay (WTP)of local and non-local visitors and the relationship between WTP and environmentally responsible behavioural intentions (ERBI)and satisfaction. The key findings include a positive correlation between WTP and ERBI for local visitors and a positive correlation between WTP and satisfaction for non-local visitors. These differences between local and non-local visitors are the result of the affective connection of local visitors to the environment, as such connection is not found among non-local visitors. These findings provide important clues to help improve pricing strategies and service quality towards achieving a sustainable ecotourism industry in Hong Kong, and they offer implications for ecotourism elsewhere. © 2019

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis Osbeck, 1765, hereafter referred to as humpback dolphin) in Xiamen waters, South China Sea, is a threatened population. Previous field surveys on this population have been conducted in Xiamen waters, as well as adjacent waters of Zhangzhou in the south. Supplementary, the present study expanded boat-based surveys and photo-identification of humpback dolphin to the east, including waters of Weitou Bay, Jinjiang City as well as Xiaodeng and partial Dadeng Island, during June to August, 2013, to obtain the basic information on distribution and abundance of humpback dolphin in this region. A total of 26 independent humpback dolphin sightings were encountered and 27 individuals were identified. All the individuals identified in Weitou Bay were matched in the photo-identification database of Xiamen humpback dolphin, indicating that humpback dolphin in Weitou Bay is a partial expand to Xiamen waters. The overall encounter rates in the present study area were 5.8 sightings/100km and 24.8 individuals/100km, which were higher than those in other waters in Xiamen, indicating this area is a critical habitat for humpback dolphins, and deserves high priority for conservation and management. © 2019, Science Press.

ABSTRACT: Understanding individual interactions within a community or population provides valuable insight into its social system, ecology, and, ultimately, resilience against external stimuli. Here, we used photo-identification data, generalized affiliation indices, and social network analyses to investigate dyadic relationships, assortative interactions, and social clustering in the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis). Boat-based surveys were conducted between May 2013 and October 2015 around the North West Cape, Western Australia. Our results indicated a fission–fusion society, characterized by nonrandom dyadic relationships. Assortative interactions were identified both within and between sexes and were higher among members of the same sex, indicating same-sex preferred affiliations and sexual segregation. Assortative interactions by geographic locations were also identified, but with no evidence of distinct social communities or clusters or affiliations based on residency patterns. We noted high residency among females. Models of temporal patterns of association demonstrated variable levels of stability, including stable (preferred companionships) and fluid (casual acquaintances) associations. We also demonstrated some social avoidance. Our results point to greater social complexity than previously recognized for humpback dolphins and, along with knowledge of population size and habitat use, provide the necessary baseline upon which to assess the influence of increasing human activities on this endemic, Vulnerable species. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Incorporating the perception and attitudes of key stakeholders into conservation management can contribute to biodiversity conservation and has the potential to resolve human-wildlife conflicts. To this end, there is scope to enhance conservation outcomes by improving the capture and analysis of stakeholders perceptions and translating these into the management decision making process. Here, an ecosystem services approach (i.e. the benefits people obtain from nature) is used to assess the societal benefits derived from a specialized and rare behavior exhibited by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) that cooperatively forage with artisanal fishers in Laguna, southern Brazil. From interviews, we identified ecosystem services based on the perception of artisanal fishers who take part in this interaction. The perceived benefits of cooperative fishing with dolphins, identified from these interviews, were grouped into eight ecosystem services assigned into cultural (n = 7) and provisioning (n = 1) related services. The results showed that experienced fishers were more likely to identify multiple and diverse ecosystem services, while fishers exposed to tourists tended to focus on tourism and recreation leisure as benefits from fishing with dolphins. Our findings show that the human component is a key element in this system and support the proposal that future conservation decisions and management plans of Laguna's bottlenose dolphins should involve artisanal fishers to be more effective. Our findings indicate that an ecosystem services approach could help decision-makers to better integrate social, economic and cultural aspects of human-wildlife interactions into conservation and management strategies for wildlife in a wider context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Small cetaceans, such as the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), do not migrate long distances to forage but use rather small areas subject to food source variations. Information on their distribution, behaviour, habitat use, and estimated population density play an important role in the identification of critical areas and regulating human activities within. Here we examine the seasonal variations, group size, and distribution of Guiana dolphin in the southern Gulf of Venezuela, to identify their critical habitats and thus aid mitigation planning. We used boat-based surveys with a follow-group protocol where observers monitor groups of animals for 30 min, from a distance of 20 to 30 m, gathering the following data: date, time observed, GPS position, estimated number of individuals, presence of calves, behavioural observations (when possible); and environmental parameters (sea-surface temperature, water transparency, salinity, sea state [Beaufort], and cloud cover). We found that Guiana dolphins did not use the studied area (6.33 km2) homogeneously but rather aggregated in north of Zapara Island's retaining wall. The highest density of dolphins was between 301 and 573 individuals within 4.22 km2 approximately off north of Zapara Island, and the lowest (1 - 150 individuals) at the entrance of the main navigation channel. The group size was considerably larger in the wet season (mean ± SD = 6.4 ± 1.9 individuals, range = 1 to 80) than the dry season (2.2 ± 2.7 individuals, range = 1 to 27). The number of sightings differed among seasons (dry/wet), there were more sightings in the wet season (1.3414 ± 0.4389 groups, range = 1 to 5) than dry season (1.1233 ± 0.7418 groups, range = 1 to 5). Our data suggest this population might be highly adapted to local conditions and prey movements, and use the areas intensely year around, particularly during the wet season. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs) depends on clear conservation objectives and ecologically meaningful boundaries. The east coast of Scotland bottlenose dolphin population expanded its distributional range during the 1990s beyond the boundaries of the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC), originally proposed to contain their core area of distribution. Two decades on, this study assesses the importance for this population of St Andrews Bay and the Tay estuary, 300 km south of the SAC. Photoidentification data from 2009 to 2015 were analysed using mark–recapture models to investigate the proportion of the population that uses St Andrews Bay and the Tay estuary. Habitat models were fitted to bottlenose dolphin presence–absence data to identify areas of high use. The estimated number of dolphins using St Andrews Bay and the Tay estuary during the summer increased from 91 (95% confidence interval 78–106) in 2009 to 114 (95% confidence interval 95–137) in 2015, representing, on average, 52.5% of the total estimated east-coast population for that period. Spatial mixing of individuals during the summer between St Andrews Bay and the Tay estuary and the Moray Firth SAC was estimated to be a minimum of ~6% per year and ~30% over the study period. The entrance to the Firth of Tay and waters around Montrose were identified as areas of consistent high use. The importance of St Andrews Bay and the Tay estuary reconfirms that effective monitoring of the population requires dedicated effort in both this area and the SAC. The results lead to consideration of the wider context of area-based management for the conservation/management of highly mobile wide-ranging species and human activities that might impact them. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans occupying coastal habitats are at high risk of impact from anthropogenic sources which can cause direct mortality or affect long-term health. Monitoring and detecting change require long-term studies and reliable funding, not always available especially in developing countries. Management and conservation of cetaceans must therefore use precautionary methods that allow assessment from limited data sources to identify risk of, and prevent, species extirpation or extinction. IUCN Red List criteria for regional populations was applied to the population of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) resident in Menai Bay Conservation Area off the south coast of Zanzibar, East Africa which is subjected to unsustainable entanglement rates in gillnet fisheries and unregulated tourism activities. Photographic identification surveys were conducted in 2015 to generate a new abundance estimate from capture–recapture analysis. Mortality estimates were calculated using available data from 1999 to 2002 and a population viability analysis was conducted based on population, species and genus specific parameters. The 2015 abundance estimate for humpback dolphins was 19 (95% CI 14–25) non-calf individuals, representing a 63% reduction in abundance since 2002. The population viability analysis baseline scenario predicted chance of extinction at 0.996 (SE 0.002) with the median time to extinction at 36 years. Sensitivity analysis suggested that population recovery would only be possible with a complete prevention of bycatch mortality. The population met the threshold for Critically Endangered for all criteria which could be directly assessed. This conservation assessment highlights the requirement for immediate management action to eliminate bycatch of humpback dolphins to prevent the local extinction of the species. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Odontocete cetaceans bioaccumulate high concentrations of endocrine disrupting persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene (DDE), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) – collectively DDTs – but few studies have explored DDTs-mediated endocrine disruption in cetaceans. Herein, we use remotely collected blubber biopsies from common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting a site with high localized DDTs contamination to study the relationships between DDTs exposure and steroid hormone homeostasis in cetaceans. We quantified blubber steroid hormone concentrations by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and blubber POP concentrations by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We detected six steroid hormones in blubber, including progesterone (P4), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP4), androstenedione (AE), testosterone (T), cortisol (F), and cortisone (E). Sampled dolphins (n = 62) exhibited exposure to DDT, DDE, DDD, chlordanes (CHLDs), mirex, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs). Using principal components analysis (PCA), we determined that blubber DDTs primarily loaded to the first principal component (PC1) explaining 81.6% of the total variance in POP exposure, while the remaining POPs primarily loaded to the PC2 (10.4% of variance). PC1 scores were negatively correlated with blubber T in males and blubber F in females, suggesting that exposure to DDTs impacted androgen and corticosteroid homeostasis. These conclusions were further supported by observed negative correlations between T and o,p’-DDE, o,p’-DDD, and p,p’-DDD in males sampled in the fall, and between F and the six individual DDTs and ∑6DDTs in females. Overall, these results suggest that POP-mediated endocrine disruption may have occurred in this stock of dolphins, which could negatively impact their health and fitness. However, this study relied on uncontrolled incidental exposures, making it impossible to establish a causal relationship between DDTs exposure and endocrine effects. Importantly, this study demonstrates that remotely collected blubber biopsies are a useful matrix for studying endocrine disruption in marine mammals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Critically endangered Māui dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) are found exclusively off the west coast of New Zealand’s North Island. One important data gap troubling efforts to reduce the current unsustainable level of bycatch is the limited information on the offshore and alongshore limits of their range. Passive acoustic monitoring studies could address this data gap, but Māui dolphin habitat is dominated by a sandy substrate that can shift greatly in the strong local currents. In February 2016, a short pilot CPOD deployment was thus attempted as a first step to see if the equipment could be deployed and recovered in the area and if the data collected would be viable, with a second unit deployed inside a harbour for comparison with earlier TPOD data. The pilot was largely successful, and roughly 11% of all minutes in the core habitat location contained detections of clicks attributed to Māui dolphin. A visual inspection of the data suggests some trends with diel and tidal patterns. Further work of this type is thus recommended. © 2019, © 2019 Crown Copyright.

ABSTRACT: The main response of top predators to human-induced environmental changes is often behavioral. Although human activities regularly impose a disturbance on top predators, they can also be a source of reliable and concentrated food resources for species with a high degree of behavioral plasticity. This study represents the first assessment of the influence of these resources on migratory patterns and social interaction of a marine top predator, the common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. Pollock's closed robust design models and association analyses were applied to data collected over 9 consecutive years of research in a coastal area subject to significant use and pressure by humans. Photo-identification data were collected year-round during 955 boat-based surveys, resulting in 1638 common bottlenose dolphin group encounters. Results of this study revealed a significant upward trend in density of bottlenose dolphins, preferences for a coastal area with higher human pressure, and a reduction of the social interactions associated to a temporal switch to the food sources provided by human activities. The observed link between human activities and changes in common bottlenose dolphin behavior aim to contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of a marine top predator and provide some of the needed baseline data, from which effective management and conservation strategies can be designed. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of a dolphin's body mass is central to establishing body condition, comparing across individuals, and designing successful management programs. In the present study, sex-specific prediction equations for estimating body mass were generated from morphometrics (i.e., length and girth) and ages of bottlenose dolphins residing under professionally managed care. Measurements of wild dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, were used to generate sex-specific body mass reference ranges. Gompertz growth models were fitted to length measurements and age to compare growth across populations. From the regression analyses, the body mass of managed females (R2 = 0.937), managed males (R2 = 0.953), wild females (R2 = 0.979), and wild males (R2 = 0.972) were predicted with high levels of accuracy. Managed adults had similar or longer asymptotic lengths compared to their wild conspecifics. To apply this information, ZooMorphTrak, a mobile software application, was developed to provide a new resource for management. The “Approximate” feature was designed to approximate body mass based on user inputs of individual morphometrics. The “Management” feature compared a managed dolphin's known body mass with respect to body mass reference ranges generated from wild dolphins.

ABSTRACT: Population studies of marine mammals are costly and time-consuming. Nevertheless, many people are happy to use their own resources to apply similar procedures to those necessary to evaluate dolphin populations in dolphin watching tourism. This offers a unique opportunity to collect sufficient data on dolphins to allow for conservation status evaluation by means of Citizen Science, a trending method. Here we crossed information on which species are targeted by tourism and which were lacking important population and ecology data, returning a list of 16 dolphin species which could benefit from dolphin watching tourism to assemble population data with conservation value. We make the case for engaging tourists and tourism agencies in a citizen science effort to raise data on dolphin species. For that, we offer suggestions for dolphin population analyses applicable by non-scientist personal. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Predictive species distribution models (SDMs) have become powerful tools to determine habitat use patterns of mobile marine predators and their spatial overlap with potentially impacting anthropogenic activities. This study used SDMs to investigate fine-scale habitat use patterns of two poorly known and broadly sympatric coastal delphinids, Chilean dolphins (Cephalorhynchus eutropia) and Peale's dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis), and their spatial interactions with intense aquaculture farming activities in the Chiloé archipelago, southern Chile. A long-term dataset (2002–2012) of boat-based dolphin sightings and concurrently in situ collected environmental and anthropogenic variables was analysed using binomial Generalized Additive Models to investigate ecological drivers of each species' fine-scale distribution and to predict dolphin occurrence spatially. Chilean dolphins preferred shallow (<30 m deep), turbid waters, close to shore (<500 m) and river mouths which often placed them in sheltered bays and channels used intensively by shellfish farms. Peale's dolphins were also found in shallow waters but occurred over a wider range of conditions along more open or exposed coastlines. Both species had to navigate extensive salmon and shellfish farming sites to transit between areas of important habitat. Sightings and predicted occurrence maps showed a clear pattern of spatial habitat partitioning between species, which remained stable across the 11 year study period. The identification of important habitat for Chilean dolphins warrants the consideration of spatially explicit conservation measures to limit the potential effects of overlapping salmon and shellfish farming. The observed differences in ecological plasticity of the two sympatric species should be considered when evaluating and mitigating the effects of environmental change and ongoing anthropogenic pressures on their nearshore habitat. The estimated species–environment relationships could also be used to predict where dolphin habitat and anthropogenic activities are most likely to overlap in other parts of the species' ranges. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A small population of coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) inhabits the inland waters of Laguna, southern Brazil. A subset of this population interacts with artisanal fishermen. This specialized foraging tactic structures dolphin society into ‘cooperatives' (participants of the interaction) and ‘non-cooperatives' (non-participants). Between 2012 and 2015, a bridge was constructed in Laguna over an important core area for dolphins. Photo-identification and georeferenced data collected on boat surveys, conducted both before and during bridge construction, were used to evaluate changes in both ‘cooperative' and ‘non-cooperative' dolphin distribution. Changes in dolphin distribution were analysed with kernel densities and hurdle models. A grid of 120 cells of area 1 km2 was used to model dolphin distribution, and the minimum distance from the grid cell centre to the bridge and to the area of gillnet use were defined as explanatory variables of human activities. Habitat descriptors (depth and distance) from the lagoon margin were also considered in the model procedure. Dolphin distribution patterns shifted between periods. A core area used by ‘non-cooperative' dolphins near the bridge construction works disappeared. The effects of habitat descriptor and anthropogenic activity on dolphin distribution also differed between periods. Before bridge construction, the abundance of ‘non-cooperative' dolphin was higher close to the bridge area (p < 0.05). During bridge construction, the presence of ‘cooperative' and ‘non-cooperative' dolphins decreased significantly with the distance from gillnet fishing activity (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively). This study highlights the importance of accounting for individual variations in response when assessing the effects of a habitat disturbance, or when implementing conservation plans. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans in the Southern California Bight (SCB) are exposed to high levels of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs), which have previously been linked to impaired reproductive health and immune responses. We used a combination of molecular tools to examine the potential physiological impacts of HOC exposure in two bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) ecotypes in the SCB. We quantified 25 HOCs in the blubber of 22 biopsies collected from males between 2012 and 2016. We then analyzed genome-wide gene expression in skin using RNA-sequencing and measured blubber testosterone to compare HOC exposure with cellular and endocrine biomarkers. We found high levels of HOCs in both ecotypes with significantly higher total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), and chlordane-related compounds in the coastal ecotype versus the offshore ecotype. We found evidence of PBDE bioaccumulation in both ecotypes, however, the pattern of bioaccumulation or endocrine disruption for other HOCs was different between the ecotypes, suggesting potential endocrine disruption in the coastal ecotype. We also observed correlations between HOCs and gene coexpression networks enriched for xenobiotic metabolism, hormone metabolism, and immune response that could indicate cellular effects from HOC exposure. By integrating measurements of HOC load with both transcriptome profiling and endocrine biomarkers, our approach provides insight into HOC exposure and potential impacts on wild cetacean health in southern California.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Social living brings competition over mates, relationships, and resources, which can translate to direct conflict. In dolphins, tooth rakes received from conspecifics are highly visible and reliable indicators of conflict. New rakes indicate recent conflicts while healed rakes suggest older instances of conflict. Here, we investigate the healing time of conspecific tooth rakes in wild bottlenose dolphins, create a demographic profile of injury risk in the population, and consider the implications for age- and sex-specific aggression. Using photographic and scarring data from the Shark Bay Dolphin Research Project spanning 31 years (N = 269 tooth rakes), healing time was analyzed using a subset of sequential photographs of the same body part over 1–12 years (N = 70 tooth rakes). Ninety percent of tooth rakes in males and 95% of tooth rakes in females were no longer visible within 400 days, with males taking longer to heal than females. Using the full sample, we examined age and sex-effects on the prevalence of new tooth rakes. A negative quadratic model best fitted tooth rake prevalence patterns from ages 0 to 13 and a positive linear regression best fitted tooth rake prevalence patterns from ages 13 to 30. Both analyses revealed significant age and sex effects, where males had more tooth rakes than females. Age differences in tooth rake prevalence may be attributed to life history events such as sexual maturity onset, male-male competition and alliance formation, and sexual coercion. These results contribute to our understanding of the relationship between social conflict and life history strategies in long-lived mammals. Significance statement: In wild dolphins, tooth rake scars indicate conspecific conflict, and the timing of such conflict clarifies the challenges faced during each life history stage. Based on > 30 years of longitudinal data, we created a demographic profile of new tooth rakes to identify patterns of age- and sex-specific received aggression. Males had more tooth rakes than females, but females healed faster than males. Juveniles had the greatest tooth rake prevalence compared to calves and adults, suggesting greater exposure to some level of conflict. Differences in patterns of tooth rake prevalence and aggression have implications regarding the costs of sexual maturity and reproduction in dolphins. To our knowledge, no study has examined the rate of received aggression across the lifespan. Our methods can be applied to other studies of wild marine mammals, where agonistic encounters are difficult to observe, but wounds are apparent. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: There is currently a growing interest in the area of drag reduction. In this work, the thermal effects of body color of some species of aquatics like Orcas and Dusky dolphins are investigated with respect to their swimming routes and geometric and behavioral characteristics. Considering the marine and atmospheric characteristics of these aquatics' routes, a thermal analysis is performed. The surrounding fluxes including the water flux, sun irradiation, and core temperature are considered in an energy balance to determine the skin temperature of the top side of the animal/organism's body. To study the effects of color on the surface temperature of the aquatic species, an experiment is carried out in the water on a flat plate with black and white color. Applying a turbulent analytical solution for heated boundary layers, it will be shown that the black color on the top of the bodies of these marine organisms is very efficient in terms of skin drag reduction. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the temperature on underwater skin friction drag reduction, the turbulent flow is simulated around a flat plate and a 2- dimensional modeled Killer whale at different temperatures. The results show that the top black body color of Orca and Dusky dolphin decreases their skin friction drag by 7%. This study will also provide the reason for this evolution of color scheme of other extremely fast marine animals, such as billfish, whales, and sharks. This method of drag reduction can be considered as one of the effective factors in skin drag reduction of underwater robots. © 2019

ABSTRACT: The phylogenetic relationships of oceanic dolphins (family Delphinidae) remain unclear. Several works using mitochondrial and/or nuclear DNA on different genera and species have been published, though no consensus exists regarding even the subfamilies that conform the family. Here, a new phylogeny for the family Delphinidae, including 36 different complete mitochondrial genomes (plus two outgroups), was constructed under Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Results indicate identical tree topology in both cases, with almost all nodes fully supported independently of the reconstruction approach. This topology is different from those previously published and proposes new phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies, genera and species of the family. These findings are critically important for the study of oceanic dolphin taxonomy, ecology, evolution and conservation, and highlight the importance of revisiting and resolving uncertain phylogenies. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: A previous comparison of whistles using data sampled at 48 kHz suggested that certain frequency parameters vary along a latitudinal gradient. This geographical pattern may be biased because whistles sampled at higher frequencies could potentially have very different frequency contents. The current study compared the acoustic parameters of Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) whistles recorded at a higher sampling rate (96 kHz) and from groups occupying two never before sampled sites, Benevente Bay, Espírito Santo, Brazil, and Formosa Bay, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, with recordings of other populations in South America. By only considering data sampled at a rate of at least 96 kHz, we aimed to detect differences in whistles across locations. Contrary to previous findings, our analyses do not indicate any clear separation between northern and southern populations based on whistles, and do not corroborate the hypothesis of latitudinal acoustic variation in this species. The variation in Guiana dolphin whistle parameters found here appears to be influenced by latitude to some extent, but several other factors, including sampling method, environmental fluctuations, and social influence on vocal learning, may be confounding the detection of a geographic pattern in these whistle samples. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Metals are subject to internal subcellular compartmentalization, altering their bioavailability. Thus, subcellular metal assessments are crucial in biomonitoring efforts. Metal distribution in three subcellular fractions (insoluble - ISF, thermolabile - TLF and thermostable - TSF) were determined by ICP-MS in Steno bredanensis specimens from Southeastern Brazil. Associations between metals, metallothionein (MT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were also investigated. Differential metal-detoxification mechanisms were observed. MT detoxification was mostly noted for As, Cd, and Pb, while Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni, Se and Ti displayed lower MT-associations. Fe, Zn and Se, on the other hand, were poorly associated to MT, and mostly present in the ISF, indicating low bioavailability. This is the first report on subcellular Sn and Ti distribution in cetaceans and the first in this species in Brazil. Potential protective roles of essential metals against toxic elements are postulated. This study indicates that important biochemical detoxification information is obtained through subcellular fraction analyses in marine mammals. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Whale watching is a popular commercial activity, producing socio-ecological benefits but also potential long-term effects on the targeted cetacean population. This industry is currently developing in data-deficient contexts in a largely unregulated fashion. Management schemes should adopt precaution and be informed by the relevant literature, but would be more effective if the assessment of the target population vulnerability, biological impacts, and management implications was drawn from site-specific data. This paper focuses on a reef-associated, data-deficient population of spinner dolphins in the Egyptian Red Sea. In Satayah Reef, new information on population size and dynamic parameters were documented using visual observation and photo-identification-based capture–recapture methods (Cormack–Jolly–Seber time-since-marking model). Dolphins occurred on 98% of the survey days. Average school size was 66 individuals (±42.1 SE), with most groups including calves. The population was equally divided into recurrent and transient individuals. An “emigration + mortality” model best described residence at the site. Five recurrent males (5% of the Satayah population) provided connectivity between this and the geographically close population of Samadai Reef. Average annual survival probability was 0.83 (±0.06 SE) in the year following first capture and 0.99 (±0.06 SE) for recurrent individuals. Mean yearly population sizes ranged 143–207 individuals. The study had the power to detect a 30% decline in the population, but not the rate of change in abundance estimated from the data (r = 0.018 ± 0.04), which would have required a 3- to 5-times longer study. Synthesis and application: These findings advance the assessment of the Satayah population's intrinsic vulnerability and have three major management applications: (a) the delineation of management units; (b) the identification of key indicators for future impact monitoring and assessment; and (c) realistic estimates of the statistical power for trend detection. Based on our results, we recommend supporting future research, devising site-specific time–area closure plans, and integrating them in a regional scheme. Approaches employed in this case study can inform the management of whale watching industries targeting other data-deficient populations. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Heaviside's (or Benguela) dolphin (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) is endemic to the west coast of southern Africa. The present study investigated the population genetic structure across a large portion of the species distribution using mitochondrial control region and nuclear (microsatellite) markers. A total of 395 biopsy skin samples were analyzed; they were collected from free-ranging Heaviside's dolphins in 7 locations along 1650 km of coast between Table Bay, South Africa and Walvis Bay, Namibia. Both genetic markers rejected the hypothesis of 1 homogenous population but revealed contrasting results in the genetic structuring of putative populations. Mitochondrial DNA suggested either 2 populations or a fine-scale division with 6 (sub) populations, while microsatellite markers were indicative of 2 widespread populations with measurable gene flow between them. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution of the mitochondrial sequences indicated a departure from mutation–drift equilibrium due to a population expansion at the 2 extremes of the geographic range, but not towards the middle of the distribution. These results highlight the importance of evaluating multiple genetic markers to gain reliable insights into population processes and structure. © 2019 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

ABSTRACT: A key in dolphin's conservation efforts is understanding their distribution and habitat preference. A common method for mapping dolphin's presence is the detection of their vocalizations. In this paper, we propose a novel detection technique for dolphin's whistles, referred to as ECV (Entropy, Correlation, and Viterbi algorithm). ECV is a robust detector of low complexity that automatically detects dolphin's whistles and extracts their spectral features, using a single receiver with only a few system parameters. The method employs a chain of decisions based on spectral entropy and time-domain correlation followed by constrained Viterbi algorithm to extract the whistles' features. Simulation results as well as performance over real recordings show a good trade-off between detection and false alarm, that compares well with the widely used PAMguard system. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic call sequences are important components of vocal repertoires for many animal species. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) produce a wide variety of vocalizations, in different behavioural contexts, including some conspicuous vocal sequences–the ‘bray series’. The occurrence of brays is still insufficiently documented, contextually and geographically, and the specific functions of these multi-unit emissions are yet to be understood. Here, acoustic emissions produced by bottlenose dolphins in the Sado estuary, Portugal, were used to provide a structural characterization of the discrete elements that compose the bray series. Information theory techniques were applied to analyse bray sequences and explore the complexity of these calls. Log-frequency analysis, based on bout criterion interval, confirmed the bout structure of the bray series. A first-order Markov model revealed a distinct pattern of emission for the bray series’ elements, with uneven transitions between elements.

ABSTRACT: Synchronizing behaviors in interactions, such as during turn-taking, are often impaired in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Therapies that focus on turn-taking generally lead to increased social skills, less interruptions, and silent pauses, however a positive non-demanding environment is therefore thought to be beneficial. Such an environment can be achieved by incorporating animals into therapy. Our study was guided by the following research questions: (1) How can we characterize the interaction between child and therapist during dolphin-assisted therapy, with regard to synchrony in verbalizations (turn-taking) and (2) does synchrony change over the course of six sessions of therapy? To answer these questions, we performed a cross-recurrence quantification analysis on behavioral data of five children, to give a detailed view of the interaction between therapist and child in the context of dolphin-assisted therapy. We were able to detect synchrony (i.e., adequate turn-taking) in all dyads, although not all children improved equally. The differences might be explained by a delayed reaction time of some children, and their level of language development. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Without high impact forces, it is not clear how humans can utilize tendon elasticity during low-impact activities. The purpose of the present study was to examine the muscle-tendon behavior together with the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle during the human dolphin-kicking. In a swimming pool, each subject (n = 11) swam the 25 m dolphin-kicking at two different speeds (NORMAL and FAST). Surface EMGs were recorded from the VL and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Simultaneous recordings of the knee joint angle by electro-goniometer and of the VL fascicle length by ultrasonography were used to calculate the muscle-tendon unit and tendinous length of VL (LMTU and LTT, respectively). In the dolphin-kicking, the stretching and shortening amplitudes of VL LMTU did not differ significantly between the two kicking speed conditions. However, both stretching and shortening amplitudes of the VL fascicle length were lower at FAST than at NORMAL speed whereas the opposite was found for the VL LTT values. At FAST, the contribution of the VL tendinous length to the entire VLMTU length changes increased. The EMG analysis revealed at FAST higher agonist VL activation from the late up-beat (MTU stretching) to the early down-beat phases as well as increased muscle co-activation of VL and BF muscles from the late down-beat to early up-beat phases of dolphin-kicking. These results suggest that at increasing kicking speeds, the VL fascicles and tendinous tissues during aquatic movements can utilize tendon elasticity in a similar way than in terrestrial forms of locomotion. However, these activation profiles of VL and BF muscles may differ from their activation pattern in terrestrial locomotion. © Copyright © 2019 Sano, Sakamoto, Nishimura, Danno, Komi and Ishikawa.

ABSTRACT: Research on anthrozoology has greatly increased in recent decades, especially with regard to anthropomorphism and attitudes toward animals in general. Nevertheless, these studies have rarely distinguished between different nonhuman species. Previous studies have indicated human preferences for apes, a finding which usually is explained by their strong likeness to humans. Moreover, anthrozoological research has rarely focused on dolphins even though they seem to have a unique position in human–animal relationships, one that has been reported throughout history. This paper presents two studies examining which characteristics humans attribute to dolphins, apes, and whales (Study 1) and whether humans attribute more positive and fewer negative characteristics to dolphins than to apes or whales (Study 2). In study 1, 86 German university students were asked to name characteristics of one species (dolphins, apes, or whales). The participants suggested many more positive than negative attributes and predominately characterized apes as human-like. In study 2, the important attributes from study 1 were included in a questionnaire comprising items referring to 12 positive and six negative attributes. The participants in study 2 (n = 258 German university students) rated dolphins significantly more positively than apes on six of the 12 positive and on five of the six negative attributes. Furthermore, the participants rated dolphins more positively than whales on most of the attributes. In sum, the results of these two studies confirm the attribution of positive characteristics to dolphins, but provide no evidence of a glorification of dolphins as frequently suggested by anecdotal reports. The findings are discussed with regard to the frequently claimed influence of human-likeness on human preferences for different species. © 2019, © 2019 ISAZ.

ABSTRACT: Indonesia has a very high diversity of Cetacean, observation with good accuracy and precision must be a priority in every observation. Several methods have been developed to help calculate the marine mammal population, one of them by using Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). VTOL UAS is flown at a certain height to capture photos that contain the number of individuals in a pod, while also mapping the movements and recording their behaviors. The aim of this study was to determine the ideal angle to capture the photos. Several observation angles, 30°, 60°, and 90° were tested Observations were conducted in three sites in Indonesia (Sepa Island, Thousand Islands, Kepulauan Seribu National Park (TNKS); Liang Beach, Maluku Island; and Nai Island Kei Achipelago). The results showed that the angles greatly affected the number of objects in the photograph. For example, on the Island of Sepa, at the angle 30°, 60°, and 90°, the number of dolphins obtained were 3, 9 and 14, respectively. This study did not find any object rejection during observation with VTOL UAS. This study suggests that higher angle of photograph from VTOL UAS increases the accuracy of the observation of marine mammals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are widely distributed in all temperate and tropical oceans. Over this wide geographical distribution they show considerable range in morphological variation, which has led to descriptions of several species in the genus. Until recently, only two species of Delphinus were accepted, but this classification has become contentious. This study investigated the occurrence of morphologically different types of Delphinus in South African waters and assessed geographic and morphometric variations within each type. A total of 296 skulls of Delphinus spp., obtained from the Port Elizabeth Museum and the Iziko South African Museum, were photographed in their dorsal and ventral aspects for geometric morphometric analysis. Our results revealed three clusters of specimens based on analysis of the dorsal aspect of the skull, and two clusters for the ventral aspect. Significant differences in cranial size were found between clusters. Both cranial aspects showed that the main variations in skull shape occurred in the rostral region and braincase area, indicating divergent adaptations relating to these features. There was a substantial difference between the composition of the dorsal-aspect and ventral- aspect clusters, suggesting the presence of only one species in South African waters. Significant differences between morphological clusters associated with the three regions within the study area (cold-temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical) are probably mediated through differences in local environmental conditions (e.g. different water temperatures and productivity). © 2019, © 2019 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A female Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) carcass was found stranded in fresh condition at Jeju Island of the Republic of Korea on February 18, 2018. Body surface lacerations, gross pathology and histology of the lung indicated the cause of death as drowning by fishing gear entanglement. The dolphin was a five-year-old mature female having ovaries with follicles and a corpus albican. This is the lowest recorded age thus far of a Risso's dolphin with active ovaries. The stomach was filled with Japanese flying squid and based on their distribution, it is believed that the dolphin was foraging in the South Sea, which had not been known as their habitat before. Intestinal microbiome analysis revealed that the bacterial community predominantly comprised phylum Proteobacteria (92.8 per cent). To our knowledge, this is the first microbiome analysis and the first official necropsy report of stranding in Jeju Island of the Risso's dolphin. © British Veterinary Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: Natural and anthropogenic stressors have been reported to impact the health of marine mammals. Therefore, investigation of quantifiable biomarkers in response to stressors is required. We hypothesized that stress protein expression would be associated with biological and health variables in wild and managed-care bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). To test this hypothesis, our study objectives were to (1) determine if stress proteins in skin, white blood cells (WBCs), and plasma could be measured with an antibody-based microarray, (2) measure stress-protein expression relative to biological data (location, sex, age, environment), and (3) determine if stress-protein expression was associated with endocrine, hematological, biochemical and serological variables and gene expression in bottlenose dolphins. Samples were collected from two wild groups (n = 28) and two managed-care groups (n = 17). Proteins involved in the HPA axis, apoptosis, proteotoxicity, and inflammation were identified as stress proteins. The expression of 3 out of 33 proteins was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in skin than plasma and WBCs. Male dolphins had significantly greater expression levels for 10 proteins in skin compared to females. The greatest number of stress-associated proteins varied by the dolphins' environment; nine were greater in managed-care dolphins and 15 were greater in wild dolphins, which may be related to wild dolphin disease status. Protein expression in skin and WBCs showed many positive relationships with measures of plasma endocrinology and biochemistry. This study provides further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the stress response in bottlenose dolphins and application of a combination of novel methods to measure stress in wildlife. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Previous studies suggest that the common bottlenose dolphin population in the Croatian Adriatic Sea is structured into distinct local communities. However, their home ranges and levels of interaction remain unknown. Dedicated boat-based surveys were conducted seasonally, in three adjacent study sites from 2013 to 2017. Photo-identification data were used to identify distinct local communities by relating the social structure descriptors to the home ranges of individual animals, and to determine the community home ranges and identify the levels of interactions between them. The overlaps between the home ranges of individuals (50 and 95% kernel density estimators [KDE]) were positively correlated to association strengths between them. Three distinct communities were identified by the hierarchical cluster analysis. The individuals' 95% KDE home range overlaps and association strengths were significantly higher within the three communities than between them, indicating both social and spatial segregation. The 95% KDE home ranges of the communities showed very low to no overlap. The individuals ranged mainly centrally within the home range of their respective community. The probabilities of movement, expressed as lagged identification rates, were significantly higher within than between community home ranges. However, 37 out of 1024 identified individuals were observed in more than one community home range, indicating that the communities are not isolated. Four out of the six Sites of Community Importance currently in place within the Croatian Adriatic Sea lie within the home ranges of the three local bottlenose dolphin communities. Once these sites are declared as Special Areas of Conservation, the management scheme will need to accommodate for differences in the spatial and social ecology of these communities, and environmental and anthropogenic factors acting upon them. The results of this work provide baseline information for such tailored management. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The coastal waters of east Lewis from the Butt of Lewis to Loch Erisort are a proposed Marine Protected Area (MPA) for Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus). A total of 100.4 h (2006.4 km) of active search effort (Beaufort sea states ≤3) was collected during 72 dedicated boat surveys between 2010 and 2017 (primarily in August and September) in the southern part of the MPA and south to the Shiant Isles. Forty Risso's dolphin sightings and 24.1 h of encounter effort were recorded, predominantly along the southern and eastern Eye Peninsula in 20-40 m water depths and at distances <1 km from shore. Group size ranged from one to 50 animals (mean = 11.8 dolphins) and calves occurred in 37.5% of sightings. A total of 2404 shore-based scans (Beaufort sea states ≤3) carried out from Tiumpan Head between September 2011 and December 2017 resulted in 271 (11.3%) 'dolphin-present' scans. Dolphins were present year-round, with a seasonal increase between May and October. 'Calf-present' scans only occurred between April and October. Photo-identification images from 28 boat surveys produced a minimum population size of 117 animals. There was evidence of high inter- and intra-annual site fidelity, with individual dolphins photographically captured in up to six of the eight survey years, and between two and seven capture dates being recorded for over 45% of individuals within most years. The combined datasets support the importance of east Lewis for Risso's dolphins, and recommendations are made for ongoing monitoring of dolphin occurrence throughout the wider MPA.

ABSTRACT: Coercive mate guarding, where males use aggression to control female movements, is a form of sexual coercion which functions to constrain female mate choice. Non-human primates, for example, herd females to keep them away from competing males, but male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) also herd females to keep them close to their alliance partners. Indeed, pairs and trios of male dolphins work together to sequester single estrus females and defend them from competing alliances. Yet how males facilitate such coordination remains unknown. Here, we investigate the vocal behaviour of allied male bottlenose dolphins during the herding of individual females, examining how the production of whistles and ‘pops’ (a threat vocalisation) varied with behavioural state and inter-animal distances. Allied males produced both whistles and pops significantly more often and at higher rates during social interactions, though they differed in function. Whistle rates increased significantly when new individuals joined the consorting group, consistent with previous work showing that whistles are part of a greeting sequence for this species. Whistle matching also appeared to play a role in within-alliance coordination. Pop vocalisations increased significantly when the nearest male to the female changed, likely inducing the female to remain close as the males coordinate a guard switch. Building upon prior research examining female movements in response to pops, we show that males approach the female and current guard whilst popping, leading to a guard switch. Our results provide new insights into the use of vocal signals during cooperative mate guarding between allied male dolphins. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry allows for the measurement of steroid hormone suites in the blubber of marine mammals. By combining this technology with minimally invasive techniques such as remote biopsy, endocrine profiles can be assessed, allowing for studies of hormonal profile variation over time. In this study, we explored associations among different steroidogenic pathways and seasonal differences in blubber hormone profiles of free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins along the coast of South Carolina, USA. Male dolphins experience a peak in testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the spring, likely related to an upregulation of the androgen steroidogenic pathway during mating season. We also observed increased cortisol concentrations during summer compared to winter. Among females, there was an increase in androstenedione with elevated progesterone concentrations indicative of pregnancy, highlighting another potential endocrine marker for pregnancy in free-ranging dolphins. This work emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate season for studies on endocrine status to effectively uncover physiological variation or disruption in free-ranging cetaceans. © 2019

ABSTRACT: The world's ecosystems are altered to different extents by anthropogenic activities. Marine habitats, especially coastal areas, are subjected to an increasing pressure derived from human activities on both land and ocean. Information about species distribution is fundamental to develop effective conservation and management measures and counteract negative anthropogenic impacts. The present work explores the use of species distribution models by using the Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA)to assess the habitat suitability of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis)in Northwest Spain, and its application to the development of effective conservation and management measures. The relationship between presence-only data and ecogeographical variables (EGV)was used to assess the potential distribution of the species. Data was collected during 273 days at sea, covering a total distance of 9 417 km between March 2014 and October 2017 with a total of 91 common dolphin encounters. This study shows that tide level and sea surface salinity are the main EGVs driving the distribution of the species in coastal areas especially in waters above the continental shelf. Additionally, this study reveals the most suitable habitats for common dolphin and outlines the need to develop conservation measures and management plans to promote the protection of this species. Findings of the study contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the common dolphin distribution and emphasize the importance of species distribution models in the development of effective conservation and management strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Perhaps the world's best-known cetacean, the bottlenose dolphin shows considerable variation in behaviour between and within populations in relation to differences in natural and anthropogenic conditions. Drivers of behavioural variation need to be identified to understand the dynamics of wild dolphin populations. Little research has been published on the bottlenose dolphin population found in the Southern Adriatic Sea. Using a set of spatial, temporal and social predictors, we aimed to investigate what variables are related to the behaviour of an under-studied population of bottlenose dolphins along the coastline of Montenegro. We present the results of a year-long study monitoring the behaviour of bottlenose dolphins along coastal Montenegro. We considered the effect of topography, seasonality and group size. A large proportion of travelling (55%) small groups (mean 4, range 1-9) in shallow waters (<50 m) was observed. We showed that seasonality alone explained behaviour best, with surface-feeding and socializing-resting increasing in autumn and winter. Group size was found to be a result of behavioural choice. We suggest seasonal changes in environmental conditions and anthropogenic pressure may explain the recorded behavioural pattern. This research points to the necessity of increased collaboration in the region to help understand complex patterns in behaviour and habitat use of local dolphin populations if effective conservation measures are to be developed. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2018.

ABSTRACT: Genetic diversity is essential for populations to adapt to changing environments. Measures of genetic diversity are often based on selectively neutral markers, such as microsatellites. Genetic diversity to guide conservation management, however, is better reflected by adaptive markers, including genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our aim was to assess MHC and neutral genetic diversity in two contrasting bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) populations in Western Australia—one apparently viable population with high reproductive output (Shark Bay) and one with lower reproductive output that was forecast to decline (Bunbury). We assessed genetic variation in the two populations by sequencing the MHC class II DQB, which encompasses the functionally important peptide binding regions (PBR). Neutral genetic diversity was assessed by genotyping twenty-three microsatellite loci. We confirmed that MHC is an adaptive marker in both populations. Overall, the Shark Bay population exhibited greater MHC diversity than the Bunbury population—for example, it displayed greater MHC nucleotide diversity. In contrast, the difference in microsatellite diversity between the two populations was comparatively low. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that viable populations typically display greater genetic diversity than less viable populations. The results also suggest that MHC variation is more closely associated with population viability than neutral genetic variation. Although the inferences from our findings are limited, because we only compared two populations, our results add to a growing number of studies that highlight the usefulness of MHC as a potentially suitable genetic marker for animal conservation. The Shark Bay population, which carries greater adaptive genetic diversity than the Bunbury population, is thus likely more robust to natural or human-induced changes to the coastal ecosystem it inhabits. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The effective management of wildlife requires that populations are defined in a biological sensible manner. We investigated the population structure of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in waters around the Balearic archipelago using two complementary techniques; DNA markers (i.e. microsatellites and a portion of the mitochondrial control region) and stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N). We used tissue samples from biopsies (n = 50) and fresh carcasses (n = 7) obtained around the islands of Gimnèsies and Pitiüses, and Comunitat Valenciana (Western Mediterranean Sea). Genetic differentiation between individuals from Gimnésies and Pitiüses and between individuals from across these two areas and individuals from Comunitat Valenciana was significant when assessing FST, but no substructure was found using clustering methods (i.e. DAPC and Bayesian clustering). δ13C and δ15N profiles were not significantly different between dolphins from Gimnésies and Pitiüses. Dolphins from both areas showed coastal carbon isotopic values and similar trophic niche levels. However, the trophic niche of dolphins from Gimnésies was broader than the trophic niche of Pitiüses’ dolphins. These results indicate non-obvious population structure between the mainland and the archipelago, or between islands within the archipelago. The use of combined techniques, which integrate information over different time scales, is applicable to other species and areas. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Homophilous behaviour plays a central role in the formation of human friendships. Individuals form social ties with others that show similar phe-notypic traits, independently of relatedness. Evidence of such homophily can be found in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, where females that use marine sponges as foraging tools often associate with other females that use sponges. 'Sponging' is a socially learned, time-consuming behaviour, transmitted from mother to calf. Previous research illustrated a strong female bias in adopting this technique. The lower propensity for males to engage in sponging may be due to its incompatibility with adult male-specific behaviours, particularly the formation of multi-level alliances. However, the link between sponging and male behaviour has never been formally tested. Here, we show that male spongers associated significantly more often with other male spongers irrespective of their level of relatedness. Male spongers spent significantly more time foraging, and less time resting and travelling, than did male non-spongers. Interestingly, we found no difference in time spent socializing. Our study provides novel insights into the relationship between tool use and activity budgets of male dolphins, and indicates social homophily in the second-order alliance composition of tool-using bottlenose dolphins. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: This paper proposes an underwater covert communication method using variety dolphin whistle patterns. The proposed method classifies dolphin whistles into G groups, and binary information is allocated to every consecutive different dolphin whistle. Received dolphin whistles are decoded by the random forest method and the transient probability of consecutive dolphin whistles. Computer simulation demonstrates that the BER performance of the proposed method is better than that of random forest method. © 2019 Marine Technology Society.

ABSTRACT: Understanding marine mammal distributions is essential for conservation, as it can help identify critical habitat where management action can be taken. The semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece, has been identified as an Important Marine Mammal Area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Marine Mammal Protected Areas Task Force, based on the regular occurrence of odontocete populations. A 7-year (2011–17) dataset of boat-based surveys was used to model and predict the distribution of striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba, common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, and common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in the entire Gulf (2400 km2). Multiple geographic, bathymetric, oceanographic, and anthropogenic variables were incorporated in a combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation (GAM-GEE) framework to describe dolphin occurrence and produce distribution maps. Modelling indicated that striped and common dolphins prefer deep waters (>300 m) in the central and southern part of the Gulf, whereas bottlenose dolphins prefer shallow waters (<300 m) and areas close to fish farms along the northern–central shore. Model-based maps of the predicted distribution identified a preferred habitat encompassing most of the Gulf, also revealing: (i) hot spots of dolphin distribution covering about 40% of the Gulf's surface; (ii) an almost complete overlap of striped and common dolphin distribution, consistent with the hypothesis that common dolphins modified their habitat preferences to live in mixed species groups with striped dolphins; (iii) a clear partitioning of striped/common and bottlenose dolphin habitat; and (iv) the important role played by fish farms for bottlenose dolphins, consistent with studies conducted elsewhere in Greece. Evidence provided by this study calls for area-specific and species-specific management measures to mitigate anthropogenic impacts. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The eastern North Atlantic (ENA) has many highly productive areas where several species of cetaceans have been recorded, with the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) being one of the most frequently sighted species. However, its spatial and temporal distribution in high seas is poorly known. The study presents the results from 5 years of cetacean monitoring in the ENA (2012-2016) aboard cargo ships that follow the routes from Continental Portugal to the Macaronesian archipelagos and north-west Africa. Common dolphin was the most frequently sighted cetacean with 192 occurrences registered on effort and an overall encounter rate of 0.36 sightings/100 nmi. The species was distributed in coastal and offshore waters, but absent from the Canaries and Cape Verde islands. Statistical 'habitat' models were developed to describe and explain the occurrence of sightings of the species: variables affecting detection of dolphins had a small impact and there were clear spatiotemporal distribution patterns, influenced to some degree by environmental variables. Predicted probability of occurrence was highest in coastal waters of continental Portugal and around the Azores. The models, combined with maps of distribution, were useful to identify important areas for the species, which could be the focus of future conservation efforts. Common dolphin presence was related to depth, distance to coast and seamounts, seabed slope, chlorophyll concentration, sea-surface temperature and sea level anomalies; the possible ecological significance of these relationships is explored. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2019.

ABSTRACT: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, being a member of cetaceans, had fully adapted to inshore waters. As a threatened marine mammal, little molecular information available for understanding the genetic basis of ecological adaptation. We firstly sequenced and obtained the draft genome map of S. chinensis. Phylogenetic analysis in this study, based on the single copy orthologous genes of the draft genome, is consistent with traditional phylogenetic classification. The comparative genomic analysis indicated that S. chinensis had 494 species-specific gene families, which involved immune, DNA repair and sensory systems associated with the potential adaption mechanism. We also identified the expansion and positive selection genes in S. chinensis lineage to investigate the potential adaptation mechanism. Our study provided the potential insight into the molecular bases of ecological adaptation in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and will be also valuable for future understanding the ecological adaptation and evolution of cetaceans at the genomic level. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Up to four species of resident cetaceans can be observed in the Strait of Gibraltar. Between them we can find the common (Delphinus delphis L) and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba Meyen). Data from both species have been collected during twelve years from opportunistic platforms of whale watching, obtaining 436 records of common and 1,138 records of striped dolphins. Kernel density maps have been determined to 0.01 resolution degrees. Structural similarity index (SSI) indicates an absolute association (0.9999 ~ 1.0) between both species. The best sampling areas, determined by maximum variance of semivariogram analysis, were 2.92 m and 3.47 m for common and striped dolphins respectively. Multifractal analysis shows higher complexities (=fractal dimension Dq) in areas of high density of animals (high Q moments) indicating an intense exploring activity. Common and striped dolphins share the same space, but not in the same way. Common dolphin feed more concentrated and size diverse preys. Also, we conclude the existence of a commensal strategy of common dolphins that takes advantage of the large groups of striped dolphins to find food in the Strait of Gibraltar. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Coalitions and alliances exemplify the core elements of conflict and cooperation in animal societies. Ecological influences on alliance formation are more readily attributed to within-species variation where phylogenetic signals are muted. Remarkably, male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia, exhibit systematic spatial variation in alliance behavior, not simply within a species or population, but within a single social network. Moving SE-NW along Peron Peninsula in Shark Bay, males ally more often in trios than pairs, consort females more often, and exhibit greater seasonal movements. Ecological models predict more male-male conflict in the north, but sufficient observations of aggression are lacking. However, dolphins often incur marks, in the form of tooth rakes, during conflicts. Here we report that the incidence of new tooth rake marks varies systematically in the predicted pattern, with greater marking in the north, where males form more trios and consort females at a higher rate. While our previous work demonstrated that alliance complexity has an ecological component, we can now infer that ecological variation impacts the level of alliance-related conflict in Shark Bay. Significance statement: To understand ecological influences on animal societies, researchers have focused on differences within species, where confounds due to evolutionary history are minimized. Such differences are usually found among geographically separated populations, but in Shark Bay, Western Australia, male dolphin alliance size and access to females increase along a spatial axis within a single social network. Here we report that aggression levels, evidenced by tooth rake marks, increase along the same axis. Alliances are of particular interest as they represent a complex kind of relationship, often implicated in the evolution of social intelligence. Our discovery of spatial variation in alliance behavior and aggression within a social network provides a unique opportunity to investigate the intersection of cognition, social structure, and ecology. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Worldwide, cetacean species have started to be protected, but they are still very vulnerable to accidental damage from an expanding range of human activities at sea. To properly manage these potential threats we need a detailed understanding of the seasonal distributions of these highly mobile populations. To achieve this goal, a growing effort has been underway to develop species distribution models (SDMs)that correctly describe and predict preferred species areas. However, accuracy is not always easy to achieve when physical barriers, such as islands, are present. Indeed, SDMs assume, if only implicitly, that the spatial effect is stationary, and that correlation is only dependent on the distance between observations and not on the direction or a spatial coordinates. The application of stationary SDMs in these cases could lead to incorrect predictions and, consequently, to uninformed decision making. In this study, we identify vulnerable habitats for the bottlenose dolphin in the Archipelago de La Maddalena, Northern Sardinia (Italy)using Bayesian hierarchical SDMs that account for the physical barriers issue and provide a full specification of the associated uncertainty. The approach we propose constitutes a major step forward in the understanding of cetacean species in many ecosystems where physical, geographical and topographical barriers are present. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In the coastal environment, marine mammals are exposed to one of the fastest growing food production sectors; namely, the shellfish farming industry. Identification of critical habitats, such as foraging grounds in highly human-impacted areas, is essential to species conservation. Therefore, understanding the variables that influence a species' foraging behaviour is important for their conservation, especially for long-lived mammals such as cetaceans. The aims of this study were (a) to identify and quantify the environmental and anthropogenic drivers of wild bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) foraging behaviour, and (b) to investigate whether the shellfish farming industry influences the behaviour of this species. Behavioural observations were conducted along the north-western coast of Spain, an area affected by intensive human activities, particularly the shellfish aquaculture industry. A multi-modelling approach highlighted the importance of shellfish farm areas as a foraging ground for bottlenose dolphins. Dolphins were predicted to be more likely found foraging inside shellfish farm areas than outside (57% vs. 43%). Variability in bottlenose dolphin behaviour is likely a result of the interactions of environmental and anthropogenic drivers with prey availability and the physiological needs of the dolphins. Although shellfish farm areas provide high prey density for dolphins, they can also pose threats in a number of ways (i.e. collisions with vessels, entanglement with ropes, habitat loss, noise and water pollution). From a conservation perspective, aquaculture management should consider the presence of dolphins foraging and minimize the associated risks that this industry may pose to these coastal cetaceans. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We assessed the level of genetic variability and population structure of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in the tropical and subtropical portions of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and compared the results with previous morphological findings. We analyzed 109 samples of common bottlenose dolphins that were sequenced for control region mtDNA and genotyped for seven polymorphic microsatellite loci. The results suggested that the species in this region can be separated in two major biological units, northern and southern, with an area of parapatry at southern Brazil. The northern unit seems to occur in a wide range of depths, including offshore waters, is consistent with the canonical morphology of T. truncatus, and can be divided into three management units: 1) Saint Paul's Rocks, 2) north and northeast of Brazil, and 3) Campos and Santos Basins (that extend at least to southernmost Brazil). The southern unit is coastal, occurring exclusively in very shallow waters (< 10 m) and estuaries, and is consistent with the previously described (putative) Tursiops gephyreus. Nevertheless, a formal decision on the taxonomic status of T. gephyreus should wait for a more geographically comprehensive and data-integrative study. © 2019 American Society of Mammalogists.

ABSTRACT: The Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), a small cetacean endemic to southwestern Atlantic coastal waters, is the most endangered marine mammal species in the south Atlantic. In the Espírito Santo State, in southeastern Brazil, the Franciscana dolphin distribution overlaps regions suppressed and threatened by an intensive industrial and port development in the coastal zone. Moreover, most of Franciscana’s home range was recently impacted by the collapse of a dam that released millions of iron mining waste into the Atlantic Ocean. Considering the restricted coastal habitat of the species, these impacts can be considered an immediate threat, increasing the probability of local extinction of the species. This research calls attention to the necessity for improvement in the regional Environmental Impact Assessments, Conservation Action Plans, and to the development of an effective zoning for ports and conservation areas in the region. These actions could increase conservation efforts and mitigate the current and expected impacts on the Franciscana population in the Espírito Santo State. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT:                              Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus molds that can affect both humans and animals. Despite advances in diagnostics and therapy, medical management of this disease remains difficult. Expansion of the basic knowledge regarding its pathophysiology in animals is critical to aid in the identification of new biomarkers of infection for diagnosis and therapeutic targets. For such a purpose, proteomics can be used by addressing protein changes during various disease processes. In the present study, a mass spectrometry analysis based on isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ                             ®                             ) was applied for direct identification and relative quantitation of proteins in blood collected from 32 Aspergillus-diseased common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, 32 samples) in comparison with blood from 55 other dolphins (55 samples from 41 clinically-normal controls and from 14 cetaceans with miscellaneous non-Aspergillus inflammation diseases) and ten convalescent dolphins (28 samples). Sixty-six and 40 proteins were found to be ≥2.0-fold over- and underrepresented versus miscellaneous non-Aspergillus inflammatory dolphins, respectively, and most were confirmed vs. clinically-normal controls and convalescents. Many proteins which play a role in the adaptive immune response were identified, including MHC proteins and others involved in catalytic activity like the NADPH-ubiquinone oxido-reductases. Overall, iTRAQ                             ®                              appears to be a convenient proteomic tool greatly suited for exploratory ex vivo studies focusing on pathophysiology. This technique should be considered as a preliminary step before validation of new diagnostic markers.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: At suprathreshold sound levels, interactions between masking noise and sound signals are liable to compressive nonlinearity in the auditory system. The compressive nonlinearity is a property of the “active” cochlear mechanism. It is not known whether this mechanism is capable to function at frequencies close to or above 100 kHz that are available to odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises). This question may be answered by the use of the frequency-specific masking. Auditory evoked potentials to sound stimuli in a bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, were recorded in the presence of simultaneous maskers. Stimulus frequencies were 45, 64, or 90 kHz. Maskers were on-frequency bandlimited noise or low-frequency noise of frequencies 0.25–1 oct below the stimulus frequency. The stimuli provoked responses as a series of brain-potential waves following the pip-train rate. For the on-frequency masker, the masker level at threshold dependence on the signal level was 1.1 dB/dB. For maskers of 1 oct below the stimulus, the dependence was 0.53–0.57 dB/dB. The data considered evidence for the compressive nonlinearity of responses to stimuli, and therefore, are indicative of the functioning of the active mechanism at frequencies up to 90 kHz. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Recent years have seen an increasing interest in individual behavioral variation. However, the implications of such variation for population dynamics are often unknown. We studied the dynamics of a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) population from southern Brazil, where some individuals forage cooperatively with artisanal fishermen. We fitted mark-recapture models to 10 yr of photo-identification data to investigate the influence of this foraging specialization on dolphins’ population parameters, controlling for sex and ranging behavior. We estimated adult survival to be high (0.949 ± 0.015 SE), weakly influenced by home range size, sex or the frequency of interaction with fishermen. The slightly higher survival probability for individuals with smaller home ranges could stem from the benefits of reduced spatial requirements implied by the specialized foraging. Foraging also influenced the probability of resighting individuals, and there was no temporary or permanent emigration. Abundance fluctuated slightly over the years from 54 (95% CI = 49–59) to 60 (95% CI = 52–69) individuals, with no evident population trend. Despite such apparent population stability, we confirm this population remains small and geographically isolated which may threaten its viability and the viability of its unusual, localized foraging specialization. Our study also illustrates how accounting for individual variation can portray animal population dynamics more realistically. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Survival rates and life expectancies are commonly agreed upon indicators of well-being for animals in zoological facilities, but even the most recent survival statistics for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in marine mammal parks and aquariums use data that are now more than 25 yr old. The current study provides a comprehensive assessment of life expectancy and survival rates for bottlenose dolphins in U.S. zoological facilities from 1974 to 2012, utilizing three different analyses (annual survival rate, age-at-death, and Kaplan-Meier), examining historical trends, and comparing to comparable data from wild populations. Both survival rate and life expectancy for dolphins in zoological facilities increased significantly over the past few decades, with a modern ASR of 0.972, and mean and median life expectancies calculated via Kaplan-Meier of 28.2 and 29.2 yr, respectively. Survival rates and life expectancies for dolphins in U.S. zoological facilities today are at least as high as those for the wild dolphin populations for which there are comparable data. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Urinalysis is a rapid, simple, inexpensive, and reliable test that documents urine abnormalities reflecting various types of renal, hormonal, or metabolic diseases. Urinalysis could assist proper monitoring of the health of dolphins under human care; however, normal baseline values for dolphin urinalysis have not been reported, to our knowledge. We sampled urine from 193 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), living under human care in 24 Caribbean dolphinariums, by voluntary free-catch and analyzed the urine for chemical and microscopic variables using multi-agent dry reagent chemistry dipstick test strips, dedicated pH reagent strips, and unstained sediment slides. Most urine was clear, pale yellow to dark yellow, and had a fishy odor. Dipstick glucose, bilirubin, ketones, and nitrites were negative in all dolphins. The urine pH was acidic ((Formula presented.) ± SD; 5.88 ± 0.58) and specific gravity (SG) was 1.035 ± 0.008. Most animals had 0–2 red blood cells and white blood cells per 40× field, and were negative for proteins. On microscopic sediment, 42.7% of samples had few-to-many squamous epithelial cells; hyaline and epithelial casts were observed only rarely. Crystals were observed in 36.6% of the samples; most were calcium oxalate dihydrate (48.2%) and amorphous urates (42.4%). The values obtained in our study can be used as a reference for health monitoring of dolphins in dolphinariums, and to monitor renal conditions and function in dolphins being rehabilitated or under human care. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: While the population growth rate in long-lived species is highly sensitive to adult survival, reproduction can also significantly drive population dynamics. Reproductive parameters can be challenging to estimate as breeders and nonbreeders may vary in resighting probability and reproductive status may be difficult to assess. We extended capture–recapture (CR) models previously fitted for data on other long-lived marine mammals to estimate demographic parameters while accounting for detection heterogeneity between individuals and state uncertainty regarding reproductive status. We applied this model to data on 106 adult female bottlenose dolphins observed over 13 years. The detection probability differed depending on breeding status. Concerning state uncertainty, offspring were not always sighted with their mother, and older calves were easier to detect than young-of-the-year (YOY), respectively, 0.79 (95% CI 0.59–0.90) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.46–0.68). This possibly led to inaccurate reproductive status assignment of females. Adult female survival probability was high (0.97 CI 95% 0.96–0.98) and did not differ according to breeding status. Young-of-the-year and 1-year-old calves had a significantly higher survival rate than 2-year-old (respectively, 0.66 CI 95% 0.50–0.78 and 0.45 CI 95% 0.29–0.61). This reduced survival is probably related to weaning, a period during which young are exposed to more risks since they lose protection and feeding from the mother. The probability of having a new YOY was high for breeding females that had raised a calf to the age of 3 or lost a 2-year-old calf (0.71, CI 95% 0.45–0.88). Yet, this probability was much lower for nonbreeding females and breeding females that had lost a YOY or a 1-year-old calf (0.33, 95% CI 0.26–0.42). The multievent CR framework we used is highly flexible and could be easily modified for other study questions or taxa (marine or terrestrial) aimed at modeling reproductive parameters. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Bottlenose dolphin communication has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, the combined effect of several variables on whistle structure has yet to be clearly understood. Here, we investigated the influence of underwater noise, boat presence, behaviour, group size and calf presence on the whistles of a small population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Surface behaviour and acoustic data were collected in Sardinia (Italy-Western Mediterranean Sea) between 2015 and 2017. Whistle frequency parameters (minimum, maximum, start, end frequencies and frequency range), duration, number of inflection points and number of harmonics were correlated with the ambient noise levels recorded prior to the whistle display and to behavioural and social factors by means of GAM models. Whistle frequencies varied as a function of the interaction between noise and boat presence, mainly when the noise increased at lower frequencies. Dolphin whistles also varied according to group size, which was further affected by the presence of calves, and behaviours characterised by high levels of arousal such as feeding. The study provides sufficient evidence to support that multiple factors need to be considered when investigating whistle structure as the species is capable of adopting different strategies depending on environmental, social and behavioural context. Finally, this data indicates that communication within a small population of bottlenose dolphins is vulnerable to acoustic pollution, thereby highlighting the need for further investigation into the effects of different noises on whistle structure, as well as the consistency of patterns across different populations. Significance statement: Exploring a dolphin’s ability to adapt its communication to environmental context is crucial to understanding the consequences of ocean noise increase, especially in highly anthroposised areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. This is one of the few studies that investigate how noise and boat traffic affect bottlenose dolphin whistles whilst considering the concomitant effect of other variables such as behaviour, group size and composition. We demonstrated that dolphins vary their whistles as a function of increasing noise and boat presence, group size and calf presence, and during specific behaviour which requires intense contact between individuals. Finally, the results showed that other variables should be considered to fully understand those which influence whistle structure and adaptability. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This study evaluates for the first time organophosphorus flame retardant (OPFR) occurrence in the Alboran Sea delphinids (Spain). OPFRs were detected in all the individuals with concentration levels up to 24.7 µg/g lw. Twelve out of sixteen tested analytes were detected, being TBOEP which presented the highest detection frequency, and IDPP which presented the highest levels of concentration. OPFR distribution in different tissues (blubber, brain, kidney, muscle and liver) was evaluated. The pattern distribution showed the highest contribution for blubber (mean value of 68%) and the lowest contribution for liver (mean value of 2%). Seven OPFRs were detected in brain samples showing their capacity to surpass the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain. Moreover, high affinity for the brain tissue was observed. This is extremely important due to the neurotoxic effects of several compounds such as TCEP and TNBP. OPFR levels were compared with previously published PBDE concentrations, and no significant differences were observed. Taking into account the lower use and lower bioaccumulation and biomagnification capacities of OPFRs, this could indicate an additional OPFR source of pollution in addition to their use as FRs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Spatiotemporal models of catch rate data are used in fisheries science to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of a fishery and, more importantly, to produce a standardized index of relative abundance for stock assessment models. Here, we apply a spatiotemporal delta-generalized linear mixed model to catch rate data collected from the dolphin-associated purse-seine fishery for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean during 1975–2016. Results show that the density of yellowfin tuna had both pronounced spatial variation across the eastern Pacific Ocean and spatiotemporal variation at time scales from quarterly to decadal. In comparison to the index of relative abundance standardized via the spatiotemporal approach, that computed via the nominal approach, which is currently used in the stock assessment, under- and over-estimates initial and terminal abundances, respectively, by as much as 50% or more. The standardized index represents an improvement over the nominal index because the spatiotemporal approach imputes population density in unfished areas to obtain an area-weighted index and accounts for vessel-specific differences in fishing efficiency. The importance of area-weighting for index standardization is highlighted by the fact that ignoring it has a greater effect on the abundance index than does ignoring differences in fishing efficiency among vessels. The stock assessment model that includes standardized indices has significantly larger log-likelihood and reduced pattern in residuals than the one that includes nominal indices, suggesting that replacing nominal indices with indices from a spatiotemporal model can improve the stock assessment for yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Brucella spp. isolation is increasingly reported in cetaceans, although associated pathologies, including lesions of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, are less frequently described. Concerning the nervous system, Brucella sp. infection causing meningitis, meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis have been extensively reported in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), and less frequently in other cetacean species. Case presentation: A juvenile female common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was found stranded alive in Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) in 2005, but died shortly after. On physical examination, the dolphin showed a moderate body condition and was classified as code 2 (fresh dead) at the time of necropsy. The main gross findings were severe multiorgan parasitism, thickened and congested leptomeninges, and (sero)fibrino-suppurative and proliferative arthritis of the shoulder joint. Histopathological examination revealed the distinct features of a sub-acute systemic disease associated with Cetacean Morbillivirus (CeMV) infection. However, brain lesions diverged from those reported in systemic CeMV infection. This led to suspect that there was a coinfecting pathogen, based on the characteristics of the inflammatory response and the lesion distribution pattern in the central nervous system. Brucella sp. was detected in the brain tissue by PCR and Brucella antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the brain and shoulder joint lesions. Conclusions: The zoonotic potential of marine mammal strains of Brucella has been demonstrated both in natural and laboratory conditions. In this study, PCR detected Brucella sp. in the brain of a common bottlenose dolphin stranded in the Canary Islands; the dolphin was also co-infected with CeMV. This is the first detection of Brucella sp. infection in a stranded cetacean in this archipelago. Therefore, we stress the importance of taking adequate measures during the handling of these species to prevent the transmissions of the infection to humans. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although the global use of the 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p’-DDT) has been prohibited, its persistence in the environment has caused long-lasting exposure on marine mammals. Our previous studies revealed exceedingly high residue levels of DDTs in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) from the Pearl River Estuary region, China. However, the molecular mechanisms of p,p’-DDT toxicity on the dolphin are largely unknown. This study conducted the first cytotoxicity effect exploration of p,p’-DDT on the dolphin skin fibroblasts (ScSFs) to enhance the understanding of the cellular and molecular regulation impacts. ScSF cells were exposed to p,p’-DDT (28∼168 μM) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The exposure remarkably decreased viability of ScSF cells, possibly due to the synergetic effects of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via DNA damage and mitochondria dysfunction. The DNA damage and mitochondria dysfunction were likely triggered by an increase of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction in the cellular ATP levels, decreased expression of the genes CDK1, CDK4, cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Moreover, caspase inhibitor displayed protective activity against p,p’-DDT-induced apoptosis, indicating that caspases played a central role in p,p’-DDT-triggered apoptosis in the ScSF cells. We hypothesize apoptosis likely plays a minor role in cytocidal effects induced by p,p’-DDT exposure, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Overall, this research provides new evidence of the cytotoxic mechanisms underlying p,p’-DDT exposure on humpback dolphin skin cells, and suggests that p,p’-DDT contamination is one of key health concern issues for the protection of this marine mammal. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The current anthropogenic impacts on nature necessitate more research for nature conservation and restoration purposes. To answer ecological and conservation questions concerning endangered species, individual-based modelling is an obvious choice. Individual-based models can provide reliable results that may be used to predict the effects of different future conservation strategies, once calibrated correctly. Here, we calibrate an individual-based model of Maui dolphin movement, which generates Maui dolphin probability distribution maps. We used sighting data for calibration of the chosen parameter combinations; for each simulation run, collected simulated data was compared to the empirical survey data, resulting in cost (Badness-of-Fit) estimates. Using costs of four different aspects of dolphin behaviour, we estimated the most likely parameter combinations. With optimized parameter values, Maui dolphin probability distribution maps were created, resulting in distributions that fall well outside of the current protection zones where either gillnets or trawling or both are prohibited. With these results, protected areas can be properly adjusted to the estimated distribution of this critically endangered species and so aid in their conservation. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Although bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are known for being a highly social species that live in complex societies that rely on coalition formation and cooperative behaviours, experimental studies on prosocial behaviour in this species are scarce. Helping others reach their goals (instrumental helping) is considered as an example of prosocial behaviour. Thus, in this pilot study, we examined whether a group of five captive bottlenose dolphins would behave prosocially in an instrumental helping task. Dolphins were given the opportunity to share tokens that allow their partners to obtain a preferred toy. Dolphins were tested in their free time and they could choose to share the tokens or do nothing. None of the dolphins shared the tokens, instead, they preferred to play with them, ignoring their partners. They did transfer the tokens to other sides of the pool but out of the reach of their partners. Therefore, this group of dolphins did not spontaneously help their partners in this task, showing no preference for other-regarding behaviour in this context. © 2019 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Several dolphin species occur close inshore and in harbours, where underwater noise generated by pile-driving used in wharf construction may constitute an important impact. Such impacts are likely to be greatest on species such as the endangered Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), which has small home ranges and uses this habitat type routinely. Using automated echolocation detectors in Lyttelton Harbour (New Zealand), we studied the distribution of Hector's dolphins using a gradient sampling design over 92 days within which pile-driving occurred on 46 days. During piling operations, dolphin positive minutes per day decreased at the detector closest to the piling but increased at the mid-harbour detector. Finer-grained analyses showed that close to the piling operation, detections decreased with increasing sound exposure level, that longer piling events were associated with longer reductions in detections, and that effects were long-lasting - detection rates took up to 83 h to return to pre-piling levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Social relationships represent an adaptive behavioral strategy that can provide fitness benefits to individuals. Within mammalian societies, delphinids are known to form diverse grouping patterns and show a variety of social systems. However, how ecological and intrinsic factors have shaped the evolution of such diverse societies is still not well understood. In this study, we used photo-identification data and biopsy samples collected between March 2013 and October 2015 in Coffin Bay, a heterogeneous environment in South Australia, to investigate the social structure of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis). Based on the data from 657 groups of dolphins, we used generalized affiliation indices, and applied social network and modularity methods to study affiliation patterns among individuals and investigate the potential presence of social communities within the population. In addition, we investigated genetic relatedness and kinship relationships within and between the communities identified. Modularity analysis revealed that the Coffin Bay population is structured into 2 similar sized, mixed-sex communities which differed in ranging patterns, affiliation levels and network metrics. Lagged association rates also indicated that nonrandom affiliations persisted over the study period. The genetic analyses suggested that there was higher relatedness, and a higher proportion of inferred full-sibs and half-sibs, within than between communities. We propose that differences in environmental conditions between the bays and kinship relationships are important factors contributing to the delineation and maintenance of this social structure. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: The rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) is found in deep waters in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. In Brazil, however, they can be observed in coastal waters from north to south Brazil, a habit that makes them susceptible to several anthropogenic impacts. This species is one of the small cetaceans with the most recorded cases of accidental catches in fishing nets (bycatch). Although Steno bredanensis is classified as ‘least concern' by the IUCN RedList, little is known about its population size and population structure. The present study evaluates the genetic structure of rough-toothed dolphins based on 15 stranded individuals from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the mitochondrial D-Loop region. We were not able to obtain new data on the population structure of the species in southeastern Brazil. Therefore, the structure detected by Silva et al, 2015 should continue to be accepted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Information gaps from uninvestigated habitats can hinder population assessments and the efficacy of conservation actions for marine mammals, particularly for populations of widely distributed species. The full extent of occurrence of the world's largest (putative) population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) is not known due to a poor understanding of the western boundary of the population's range. This information gap is the basis of the most critical obstacle for assessing the population's status. To determine the distribution and abundance of the PRE humpback dolphins in the far western portion of its range, systematic line-transect vessel surveys were conducted in the Moyang River estuary (MRE) during 2013–2015. Photo identification of dolphins and cross-matching of individual dolphins between different regions were also undertaken to examine individual movement patterns. The abundance of humpback dolphins in the MRE was estimated to be 528 individuals (coefficient of variation: 28.7–50.2%). Cross-matching of individually identified dolphins from the MRE (present survey area) with those from other survey areas of the PRE showed that dolphins moved frequently across different regions of the PRE, indicating dolphins from both PRE and MRE comprise a single population (which is renamed to be the PRE–MRE population). The western boundary of this population appears to be in the waters on the eastern side of Hailing Island, as dolphins were never observed further west. Supporting around one-fifth of the PRE–MRE population and providing a quarter of the habitat of the entire PRE–MRE population, the MRE clearly also deserves consideration for greater conservation measures. Strengthening the management with stringent controls over fishing activities in the MRE and establishing a marine protected area in the core habitat are recommended to facilitate better conservation for the entire PRE–MRE humpback dolphin population. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) is one of the smallest odontocetes that commonly strands in the Philippines. Despite its apparent abundance and cosmopolitan distribution, there is no published data on the haematological and serum chemical reference values for this species. This limitation greatly affects the ability of veterinarians and marine mammal rehabilitators to make informed decisions in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and the formulation of action plans when individuals of this species strand alive. This study used blood samples from two subadult female spinner dolphins that were successfully rehabilitated after stranding in 2014 to establish haematological and serum chemistry reference values for the species. The overall resulting values of the blood parameters recorded such as the WBC (5.01-10.45 103/μL), RBC (4.23 – 6.18 106/μL), and PCV (42 – 50%) generally demonstrated narrow ranges and were close to the published reference values for other similar conspecific odontocetes. Although there were only two individuals of the species used in this study, the data gathered serves as a valuable reference tool for future cases of spinner dolphin strandings in the Philippines. © 2019, University of the Philippines at Los Banos.

ABSTRACT: Bacteria of the genus Brucella cause brucellosis, an infectious disease common to humans as well as to terrestrial and aquatic mammals. Since 1994 several cases of Brucella spp. infection have been reported in marine mammals worldwide. While sero-epidemiological data suggest that Brucella spp. infection is widespread globally, detecting Brucella spp.-associated antigens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tissues from infected animals is often troublesome. The present study was aimed at investigating, by means of IHC based upon the utilization of an anti-Brucella LPS monoclonal antibody (MAb), the central nervous system (CNS) immunoreactivity shown by B. ceti-infected, neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins. The aforementioned MAb, previously characterized by means of ELISA and Western Blotting techniques, was able to immunohistochemically detect smooth brucellae both within the CNS from B. ceti-infected striped dolphins and within a range of tissues from Brucella spp.-infected domestic ruminants. In conclusion, the results of the present study are of relevance both from the B. ceti infection's diagnostic and pathogenetic standpoints. © 2019, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

ABSTRACT: Adverse effects of exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) threaten the maintenance of odontocete populations. In southern Brazil, coastal bottlenose dolphins from the Laguna Estuarine System (LES) and Patos Lagoon Estuary (PLE) were sampled using remote biopsies during the winter and summer months. Levels of bioaccumulated POPs were measured in the blubber. The activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also quantified, as were the mRNA transcript levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), cytochrome P450 1A1-like (CYP1A1), metallothionein 2A (MT2A), GST-π GPx-4, GR, interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), and major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) in the skin. In general, levels of POPs were similar among sites, sexes, ages and seasons. For most animals, total polychlorinated biphenyl (ΣPCBs) levels were above the threshold level to have physiological effects on and pose risks to cetaceans. The best-fitting generalized linear models (GLMs) found significant associations between GR, IL-1α and GPx-4 transcript levels, SOD and GST activities, and total polybrominated diphenyl ether (ΣPBDEs) and pesticide levels. GLMs and Kruskal-Wallis analyses also indicated that there were higher transcript levels for most genes and lower GST activity in the winter. These results reinforce the need to consider the influence of environmental traits on biomarker values in wildlife assessments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Affiliative interspecies interactions are important to community structure within an ecosystem yet understudied relative to antagonistic relationships. Mixed-species associations provide important benefits via foraging, predator avoidance and social interactions. Tactile behaviours help with social bond formation and group establishment among conspecifics during social interactions, but little is known about the role of contact between heterospecific animals in mixed-species groups. Our objective was to quantify characteristics of pectoral fin contact between individuals of two sympatric species of wild dolphins, spotted dolphins, Stenella frontalis, and bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, off Bimini, The Bahamas, in order to assess possible benefits of heterospecific interactions. Using underwater video recordings from mixed-species dolphin encounters from 2011 to 2017, we observed 74 pectoral fin contacts, of which 27 were between heterospecific animals. Encounters were either affiliative (61.5%) or sociosexual (38.5%). Conspecific and heterospecific dolphins had similar rates of initiating and receiving contacts. This suggests that during mixed-species groups, the cost-benefit trade-off in choosing a social partner is similar for conspecific and heterospecific individuals. Heterospecific contacts initiated by S. frontalis were primarily affiliative whereas heterospecific contacts initiated by T. truncatus were sociosexual. Both sociosexual behaviour and pectoral fin contact in dolphins have been suggested as mechanisms of bond formation. We conclude that mixed-species interactions with pectoral fin contact may be a mechanism for social bond formation between heterospecifics and that these bonds may help to re-establish groups, as needed, for predator avoidance. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: A small and genetically isolated bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) population resides year-round in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago-Panama (BDT). Photo-identification and genetic data showed that this dolphin population is highly phylopatric and is formed exclusively by individuals of the “inshore form”. This study aimed to investigate the trophic ecology and mercury concentrations of bottlenose dolphins in BDT to assess their coastal habits. We collected muscle samples (n = 175) of 11 potential fish prey species, and skin samples from free-ranging dolphins in BDT (n = 37) and La Guajira-Colombia (n = 7) to compare isotopic niche width. Results showed that BDT dolphins have a coastal feeding habit, belong to the “inshore form” (δ13C = −13.05 ± 1.89‰), and have low mercury concentrations (mean = 1637 ± 1387 ng g−1dw). However, this element is biomagnified in the BDT food chain, showing a marginal dolphins health risk (RQ = 1.00). We call for a monitoring pollutant program and conservation strategies aimed to protect the dolphin population at BDT. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Environmental changes can affect the social structure and disrupt habitat use of marine mammal species. An impact on the social dynamics of dolphins, including group size structure, may attenuate the feeding success and increasing predation risk, especially considering species exhibiting small home ranges, which impose particular habitat dependency and high vulnerability to environmental changes. In this regard, the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis, Van Benéden, 1864) is a particularly endangered species due to its coastal distribution and considerable small home range. The aim of this study was first to conduct a spatial assessment of the dolphin groups sighted in the São Marcos Bay (SMB; Northeastern Brazil), one of the most important port areas in Brazil. The results show an overlap between the distribution of the dolphin groups and the port activities area, which includes the loading zone at the main port area and the navigation channel used by large cargo ships and other vessels. Also, a GLM regression was conducted to identify the best combination of selected variables that best predict the group size of the dolphins. The predictor variables included: salinity, sea surface temperature, depth, water transparency, distance from the main port area, and the feeding activity of the groups sighted. The results indicated that larger dolphin groups were found in areas closer to the main port area and were associated with foraging activities. Therefore, the results suggest that this dolphin population might be exposed to threats linked to the port activities, which may include noise pollution, vessel collision, and chemical pollution. © 2019, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

ABSTRACT: The problem solving capabilities of dolphins are suggested to be indicative of advanced cognition. When confronted with a novel problem, dolphins can plan their behavior to create a more efficient strategy than that which was previously modeled. The present study investigated dolphins’ ability to plan their behaviors using an interactive apparatus with accompanying weights. Two problems were presented to evaluate dolphins’ ability to plan by collecting several weights at once, thus solving the apparatus more efficiently. In contrast to previous findings, dolphins in the present study failed to plan their behavior. Rather, individual differences in problem solving strategies arose throughout the study and are described here. Dolphins engaged in several strategies in order to attempt to obtain the fish reward, including approaches that were not modeled. Strategies for solving the submerged interactive apparatus (SIA) included emulation, freeloading, water flow manipulation, and physical manipulation of the SIA. The SIA was continually solved by a single individual who rarely consumed the food reward, suggesting that she may have been motivated to participate for the challenge itself. Though not indicative of planning, the results of the present study demonstrate the plasticity of dolphin problem solving capabilities and spatial reasoning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: To manually detect dolphin whistle from the growing sound recordings of passive acoustic monitoring is laborious. In order to solve this problem, two dolphin whistle signal detection methods based on the spectral entropy are analyzed in this paper. The adaptive band-partitioning spectral entropy detection algorithm is improved and a mel-frequency band spectral entropy detection method is proposed for the dolphin whistle detection. The experimental results show that the detection methods could realize automatic detection and find the endpoints. The detection probability could reach more than 90% and the endpoint accuracy could reach more than 60% for both methods. The detection methods have some potential applications in biologically inspired communication based on the whistle duration or time delay modulation. A simple example is described by employing Morse code to modulate the text information into various whistle durations. Pool experiment verifies the feasibility of the Morse code based bionic communication method. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The macroscopic morphology of structures involved in sound generation in the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) were described for the first time using computed tomography imaging and standard gross dissection techniques. The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin may represent a useful comparative model to the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops sp.) to provide insights into the functional anatomy of the sound production in dolphins, since these coastal dolphins exhibit similar body size and share similarities on acoustic behavior. The general arrangement of sound generating structures, that is, air sacs and muscles, was similar in both the bottlenose dolphin and the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin. The main difference between the two species existed in a small left posterior branch of the melon in the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, which was not found in the bottlenose dolphin and might reflect an adaptation of directionality for high frequency communication sounds as seen in some other delphinids (e.g., Lagenorhynchus sp., Grampus griseus). Thus, this may be the main reason for the asymmetry of the sound production structures in dolphins. Additionally, the longer rostrum in Indian Ocean humpback dolphins might suggest a more directional echolocation beam compared to the Lahille's bottlenose dolphin.

ABSTRACT: Marine mammals are found in every sea worldwide and are at the highest level of the marine food chain. They communicate among themselves through sounds. It is complicated to study and to characterize these populations because they spend most of their time below the surface. Nevertheless, it is possible to analyze, characterize and classify different cetacean species through the use of bioacoustics. Our study focuses on the Pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), in particular on the influence of nautical tourism, i.e. whale-watching boats, in the Caribbean Sea on dolphin communications. The objective of this study was to observe the correlation between dolphin behaviours and whistles. The most appropriate methods had to be implemented in order to analyze ethoacoustic data. To achieve this, we compared a manual method with an automatic whistle detector. Then, we used different methods of projection (ACP and t-SNE) to reduce the dimension of acoustic data. We concluded by clustering the sounds versus the behavioural classes. The results showed that our automatic method was effective as different clusters were identified : pantropical spotted dolphin do not communicate in the same manner when they are surrounded by whale-watching boats, or during socialization. Therefore, acoustic survey is an efficient non-intrusive way to characterize the form of communication and to evaluate impacts of noise on cetaceans. Our method is effective and provides opportunities for acoustic surveys of anthropophonic pollution. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Humpback dolphins (genus Sousa), obligatory inshore delphinids, are frequently exposed to adverse effects of many human activities. In Hong Kong, one of the world’s most urbanised coastal regions, ~ 50% of the dolphins suffer from at least one type of epidermal lesions, likely related to anthropogenically degraded habitat. Furthermore, one in every ten dolphins has physical injuries indicative of vessel collisions, propeller cuts and fishing-gear entanglements. As top predators with long lifespan, dolphins are good “barometers” of marine environment and their compromised health conditions are symptomatic of increasingly degraded ecological conditions of coastal seas, especially in rapidly developing regions of fast-growing economies. © 2019, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a carnivorous cetacean thriving in marine environment that is one of the apex predators of the marine food web. They are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems which are known to be sensitive to environmental impacts. Dolphins are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems in their role as predators that can bioaccumulate contaminants. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these mammals, as well as in the context of pollutants and exposures in the marine environment, the skin and blubber are important surface and protective organs that have not been probed for metabolism. Using 1HNMR based metabolomic approach we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of stranding bottlenose dolphin samples collected from the Southern Zone coast of Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The results indicate that metabolism of skin and blubber metabolism are quantitatively very different. Further, using heat maps and random forest analysis, the results point to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. The differential metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, pointing to fat synthesis and deposition. The skin showed several metabolites involved in gluconeogenic pathways, pointing towards active metabolism. The most notable pathways implicated in both tissues included: urea cycle and glutathione metabolism among others. Our 1H NMR metabolomics analysis allowed for the identification of metabolites associated with these organ types, such as pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2‑hydroxybutyric acid, 3‑hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of the physiological roles of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation as well as useful target biopsy tissues for monitoring of dolphin health conditions in marine pollution and ecotoxicology studies. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Comparing the genetic composition of wild animals between geographic regions with distinct environments is common in evolutionary studies. However, genetic composition can also change through time in response to environmental changes but studies examining this are carried out less often. In this study, we characterize striped dolphin genetic composition in the Mediterranean Sea across both geography and time. We provide genotype data for 15 microsatellite loci and 919 bp of mtDNA control region, collected over 21 years across all main Mediterranean Sea basins. We investigated spatial genetic structure using both classical and Bayesian population structure methods, and compared it with temporal patterns of genetic change using time-series statistics. We integrated the temporal datasets with known environmental pressures and data on social structure, to infer potential drivers of observed changes. Geographic analyses suggest weak differentiation for striped dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea, with evidence for a recent expansion. Temporal analyses show significant cyclical fluctuations in genetic composition over 21 years, which correspond well with recurrent morbillivirus epizootics. Similarly, social group composition shows changes in the relative number of juveniles and adults per group, and an overall increase in the number of adults per group relative to juveniles over the time period. We suggest that the observed changes in genetic and group composition could relate to specific dynamics of morbillivirus resistance. Overall, our study highlights the importance of tracking long-term genetic variation and the potential for this species as a model in studying genetic adaptation to environmental stress. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Knowledge of proximate (causation and development) and ultimate (evolution and survival function) causes of gregariousness is necessary to advance our knowledge of animal societies. Delphinids are among the most social taxa; however, fine-scale understanding of their intra-specific relationships is hindered by the need for underwater observations on individuals. We developed a non-invasive animal-borne camera system with the goal of examining influences on gregariousness in dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus). We analyzed video and diving records from 11 individual dusky dolphins off Kaikoura, New Zealand. We examined the influence of biologger attachment on dolphin behavior and tested hypotheses regarding the effects of physiology, predation, and inter-individual variation on conspecific interactions. Dolphins did not exhibit increased rates of descent or ascent in the minutes immediately following biologger attachment, indicating a lack of behavioral response. Respiration rate was positively related to dive depth and duration, suggesting that diving is energetically expensive for this species. Gregariousness was negatively related to dive depth providing evidence that the physiological constraints of diving are likely to limit social behavior. Calves were not observed more frequently in infant (vs. echelon) position with increasing depth, highlighting the likelihood of other anti-predation strategies (e.g., dilution effect) in mother-calf pairs. We found that gregariousness differed between individuals within similar social groups, suggesting the importance of collecting data at the individual level. The evidence presented herein suggests that the further development of animal-borne camera systems will yield further insight into the mechanisms underlying delphinid social behavior. Significance statement: Dolphins are highly social and thus excellent model species for examining the cause and function of gregariousness. However, their cryptic nature poses a challenge to collecting the fine-scale data at the individual level required to conduct rigorous hypothesis tests. We overcame this obstacle by deploying a non-invasive cutting-edge biologger on free-ranging dusky dolphins to collect information on diving behavior, physiology, gregariousness, and mother-calf strategies. Results indicate that diving is energetically expensive, even to relatively shallow depths, and these costs likely hinder gregariousness at depth. Individual differences in gregariousness were apparent and as expected in this fission-fusion society. Unexpectedly, mother-calf pairs appeared to utilize strategies other than spatial positioning to minimize predation risk. This study advanced knowledge of dolphin social life and helps to improve the degree of data resolution in cetaceans to a level on par with terrestrial studies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Conveying identity is important for social animals to maintain individually based relationships. Communication of identity information relies on both signal encoding and perception. Several delphinid species use individually distinctive signature whistles to transmit identity information, best described for the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). In this study, we investigate signature whistle use in wild common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). Acoustic recordings were analysed from 11 encounters from three locations in South Africa (Hout Bay, False Bay, and Plettenberg Bay) during 2009, 2016 and 2017. The frequency contours of whistles were visually categorised, with 29 signature whistle types (SWTs) identified through contour categorisation and a bout analysis approach developed specifically to identify signature whistles in bottlenose dolphins (SIGID). Categorisation verification was conducted using an unsupervised neural network (ARTwarp) at both a 91% and 96% vigilance parameter. For this, individual SWTs were analysed type by type and then in a ‘global’ analysis whereby all 497 whistle contours were categorised simultaneously. Overall the analysis demonstrated high stereotypy in the structure and temporal production of whistles, consistent with signature whistle use. We suggest that individual identity information may be encoded in these whistle contours. However, the large group sizes and high degree of vocal activity characteristic of this dolphin species generate a cluttered acoustic environment with high potential for masking from conspecific vocalisations. Therefore, further investigation into the mechanisms of identity perception in such acoustically cluttered environments is required to demonstrate the function of these stereotyped whistle types in common dolphins. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Istanbul Strait is an important cetacean habitat that is intensely used by humans. Yet little is known about their spatial-temporal distribution. To understand the encounter rates and residency patterns of bottlenose dolphins, photo-identification data were collected between 2011 and 2016 in the Istanbul Strait. The study showed that bottlenose dolphins are a regular, year-round component of the strait. The encounter rate was estimated to be four groups (22 individuals) per 10 km. The adjacent waters of Marmara Sea and Black Sea, that host relatively less marine traffic, had the highest number of encounters in the area. Conversely, the middle sections had the lowest number of encounters but the highest marine vessel density. Further, the encounter rates dropped to zero in the fishing zones, where the number of purse seines reached up to 100 per day. Additionally, dolphins showed varying degrees of residency patterns, with multi-year re-sightings. Maximum re-sighting distance was up to 35 km, which is more than the total length of the strait. This movement pattern should be investigated as it might reveal possible migration between local populations. This study finds that the Istanbul Strait serves as a critical habitat for the regional bottlenose dolphin populations and they are likely to be a part of a resident local population with a home range extending the length of the strait. Dedicated surveys with inter-regional collaborations are needed to evaluate the home range and population status of this endangered species for their effective conservation in one of the busiest waterways of the world. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2018.

ABSTRACT: Mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), selenium (Se)and arsenic (As)concentrations in internal tissues of 72 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba)from Murcia Region (Mediterranean coastline)have been investigated for the first time. Hg showed the highest concentration, followed by Se, Cd, As and Pb. In general, the levels of metal found in this study were similar to those described in similar studies in the Mediterranean Sea. However, in some adult specimens, Hg liver concentrations were related with toxic effects in cetacean. A significant correlation was observed with age, likewise between Se and Hg and Cd in tissues, which agree with detoxify effect attributed to Se through inert complex formation. Molar ratio Hg:Se in liver was close to 1:1 in some specimens, which would indicate overload of the Hg-Se detoxify function and compromised health. These results could contribute to a better knowledge of the distribution of these persistent pollutants in the Mediterranean Sea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: West Bay is located along the south-west portion of Galveston Bay, Texas, and has been delimited as a bay, sound, and estuary (BSE) common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) stock area under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The most recent abundance estimate available for the West Bay BSE stock is from 2001 and is considered outdated for management purposes. This study provides an updated abundance estimate using photo-identification capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data collected from West Bay during the winter of 2014 and summer of 2015. The CMR data were analysed using both Pollock's robust design models and Poisson-log normal mark-resight models. Differences between the model types are discussed, and the abundance estimates derived from the mark-resight models are recommended for management use (50.63 [unconditional SE 2.23] in the winter and 44.36 [unconditional SE 1.18] in the summer). Whereas the updated abundance estimates are higher than the previously reported estimates, which varied between 28 and 38, they still indicate that West Bay supports a small population of bottlenose dolphins. As a result, the West Bay BSE stock should be closely monitored for impacts, particularly those related to human caused stressors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) are a common mass stranding species in Florida. These large stranding events typically include a small number of sick or injured individuals and a much larger number of healthy individuals, making rapid triage essential. Little data exist on rehabilitation outcomes, and historically, successful outcomes are limited. Furthermore, very little data exist on the feeding habits and dietary needs of this species. This study compared morphology and body mass index (BMI) in two rough-toothed dolphin mass stranding events in Florida: August 2004 (n = 36) and March 2005 (n = 32). The two groups were significantly different in morphologic measurements, with age and gender-adjusted intake BMI significantly (p '.01) different (2004 = 0.34 ± 0.02; 2005 = 0.41 ± 0.02) between groups. Ten animals from 2005 had weights tracked throughout the rehabilitation process and demonstrated an initial drop in BMI followed by an increase and a plateau prior to release. When comparing initial BMI by stranding outcome, individuals that were rehabilitated and released had a significantly (p =.03) higher BMI than individuals who were euthanized. However, there was no difference between dolphins that died of natural causes (p =.56) and animals successfully rehabilitated. Analysis of BMI can be a useful marker in triage during a stranding, when resources are limited to identify individuals most likely to survive, as well as in determining the appropriate body condition for release. The data reported here can provide guidance on evaluating the nutritive status on this uncommon species that would otherwise be difficult to obtain among wild populations. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A common approach to studying habitat use in cetaceans is to conduct line-transect surveys, to investigate their distribution. In developing countries, there are limited resources for data collection. One solution is to employ field surveys to collect a wide range of ecological and behavioural data, for which a haphazard sampling schedule is adopted, to optimize the cost–benefit ratio. As with line-transect surveys, the haphazard sampling may lead to spatial autocorrelation (SAC), an overlooked problem in ecology. Here, we investigated common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus truncatus) habitat use on an upwelling area and tested an approach that can improve model-based inference on auto-correlated data. We collected data in Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro, photo-identified 429 individuals and compared the predictions and model coefficients of standard generalized linear model (GLM) without correcting for spatial autocorrelation with a spatial eigenvector generalized linear model (SEV-GLM) which compensates for SAC. Our best SEV-GLM predicted dolphins are more likely to occur on cold waters with increased chlorophyll concentration, indicating dolphins are influenced by the upwelling. Moreover, by correcting for SAC, our models had a better fit to data, magnified the relevance of significant variables and showed smaller and less clumped residuals than when not correcting. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Protecting species often involves the designation of protected areas, wherein suitable management strategies are applied either at the taxon or ecosystem level. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) have been created in European waters under the Habitats Directive to protect bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, which forms two ecotypes, pelagic and coastal. The SACs have been designated in coastal waters based on photo-identification studies that have indicated that bottlenose dolphins have relatively high site fidelity. However, individuals can carry out long-distance movements, which suggests potential for demographic connectivity between the SACs as well as with other areas. Connectivity can be studied using genetic markers. Previous studies on the species in this area used different sets of genetic markers and therefore inference on the fine-scale population structure and demographic connectivity has not yet been made at a large scale. A common set of microsatellite markers was used in this study to provide the first comprehensive estimate of genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins in European Atlantic waters. As in previous studies, a high level of genetic differentiation was found between coastal and pelagic populations. Genetic structure was defined at an unprecedented fine-scale level for coastal dolphins, leading to identification of five distinct coastal populations inhabiting the following areas: Shannon estuary, west coast of Ireland, English Channel, coastal Galicia, east coast of Scotland and Wales/west Scotland. Demographic connectivity was very low among most populations with <10% migration rate, suggesting no demographic coupling among them. Each local population should therefore be monitored separately. The results of this study have the potential to be used to identify management units for bottlenose dolphins in this region and thus offer a significant contribution to the conservation of the species in European Atlantic waters. Future studies should prioritize obtaining biopsies from free-living dolphins from areas where only samples from stranded animals were available, i.e. Wales, west Scotland and Galicia, in order to reduce uncertainty caused by sample origin doubt, as well as from areas not included in this study (e.g. Iroise Sea, France). Furthermore, future management strategies should include monitoring local population dynamics and could also consider other options, such as population viability analysis or the incorporation of genetic data with ecological data (e.g. stable isotope analysis) in the designation of management units. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We report the discovery of the first cetacean pegivirus (family Flaviviridae) using a next-generation sequencing approach. One of two infected bottlenose dolphins had elevated activities of liver enzymes, which may suggest hepatocellular injury.

ABSTRACT: Infectious diseases contribute to the vulnerable status of marine mammals, including respiratory illnesses. This study aimed to capture exhaled breath condensate (blow) for microbial identification from wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins Tursiops aduncus. Individual dolphins were sampled by holding a funnel connected to a 50 ml centrifuge tube over the blowhole of the animal near shore in Shark Bay (SB), Western Australia. Four individuals were sampled on 2 occasions along with seawater samples. Comparative blow and pool water samples were collected from 4 individual common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus housed in the National Aquarium (NA), Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Bacteria were identified using the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from extracted DNA. We identified bacteria independent of seawater in SB dolphins, which included the classes Alphaproteobacteria (26.1%) and Gammaproteobacteria (25.8%); the phyla Bacteroidetes (15.6%) and Fusobacteria (7.2%); and the genera Pseudomonas (11.5%), Pedomicrobium (4.5%), Streptobacillus (3.7%), Phenylobacterium (2.2%) and Sphingomonas (2.1%). There were broad similarities in phyla between SB and NA dolphins yet there were differences between lower taxonomic groups. A number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared between dolphin individuals, which may be a result of their genetic lineage (siblings or parentage), shared living and social interactions. A number of genera were observed in SB dolphins which have species known to be infectious in marine mammals such as Pseudomonas, Mycoplasma and Streptococcus. This study successfully characterised bacteria from DNA captured in blow from wild dolphins. The ability to capture these communities from individuals in the wild provides a novel health indicator. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: The forecast for the viability of populations depends upon metapopulation dynamics: the combination of reproduction and mortality within populations, as well as dispersal between populations. This study focuses on an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population in coastal waters near Bunbury, Western Australia. Demographic modeling of this population suggested that recent reproductive output was not sufficient to offset mortality. Migrants from adjacent populations might make up this deficit, so that Bunbury would act as a “sink,” or net recipient population. We investigated historical dispersal in and out of Bunbury, using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA of 193 dolphins across five study locations along the southwestern Australian coastline. Our results indicated limited gene flow between Bunbury and adjacent populations. The data also revealed a net-dispersal from Bunbury to neighboring populations, with microsatellites showing that more than twice as many individuals per generation dispersed out of Bunbury than into Bunbury. Therefore, in historic times, Bunbury appears to have acted as a source population, supporting nearby populations. In combination with the prior finding that Bunbury is currently not producing surplus offspring to support adjacent populations, this potential reversal of source-sink dynamics may have serious conservation implications for Bunbury and other populations nearby. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Perceptual and behavioral asymmetry has been observed in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate species with its origin estimated to go back over 500 million years. Previously, hemispheric lateralization in marine mammals has been recorded during foraging, parental care, preferred swimming direction as well as when solving cognitive challenges. Visual laterality has been demonstrated in preferred eye use and performance accuracy. A female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin was trained to associate eight pairs of non-identical visual stimuli. Her performance was tested and compared under binocular and monocular conditions. No significant difference was found in accuracy, while a clear left eye advantage was demonstrated in reaction time. In addition, behavioral asymmetry was observed in movement pattern preference during the stimulus discrimination. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary relationships among cetaceans within the family Delphinidae have been difficult to resolve due to the high number of species and their relatively rapid radiation. This is the case for the dolphin species currently placed in the genus Lagenorhynchus, and their relations to Cephalorhynchus and Lissodelphis species. Phylogenetic relationships among these species have been investigated using multiple lines of evidence, and that evidence consistently suggests that the six species currently assigned to Lagenorhynchus do not form a monophyletic group. Here, we summarize findings from studies of morphology, genetics, historical biogeography, and acoustics that offer insight into the phylogenetics of these taxa. We present the taxonomic basis for revision of Lagenorhynchus, propose retention of Lagenorhynchus albirostris and reassignment of the remaining five species into other existing generic names, namely Leucopleurus acutus, Sagmatias australis, Sagmatias cruciger, Sagmatias obliquidens, and Sagmatias obscurus. Making these revisions now so that the taxonomy better reflects evolutionary relationships among these species will ensure that future studies include the most appropriate taxa for investigating the complex phylogenetic and systematic relationships among cetaceans. However, comprehensive analyses using multiple lines of evidence are still needed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships within and among the Lissodelphininae genera Cephalorhynchus, Lissodelphis, and Sagmatias. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Immunology of marine mammals is a relatively understudied field and its monitoring plays an important role in the individual and group management of these animals, along with an increasing value as an environmental health indicator. This study was aimed at implementing the knowledge on the immune response in cetaceans stranded along the Italian coastline to provide a baseline useful for assessing the immune status of bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) and striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) dolphins. In particular, since the Mediterranean Sea is considered a heavily polluted basin, a comparison with animals living in open waters such as the Atlantic Ocean was made. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded spleen, thymus, and lymph node tissues from 16 animals stranded along Italian and 11 cetaceans from the Canary Island shores were sampled within 48 h from death. Information regarding stranding sites, gender, and age as well as virologic, microbiological, and parasitological investigations, and the cause and/or the death mechanism were also collected in order to carry out statistical analyses. Selected tissues were routinely stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and with immunohistochemical techniques (IHC). For IHC analysis, anti-human CD5 monoclonal mouse antibody to identify T lymphocytes, CD20 monoclonal mouse antibody for the identification of mature B lymphocytes and HLA-DR antigen (alpha-chain) monoclonal mouse antibody for the identification of the major histocompatibility complex type II were previously validated for both species by Western-blotting technique. T-test method applied to quantitative evaluation of IHC positive cells showed a significant relationship between the number of (expression) of CD20 stained lymphocytes and normal and hypoplastic lymph nodes, respectively. No other significant correlations were noticed. Analyses for organochlorines (OC) compounds were performed in animals (no5) having frozen blubber tissue available. A simple linear regression was calculated to predict if the amount of OCs could influence the number of inflammatory cell subpopulations and a moderate negative correlation was found between the presence of high quantity of contaminants and the number of T lymphocytes. Future analysis should be aimed to understand the effect of the major immunomodulatory pathogens on sub-populations of B and T cells.

ABSTRACT: Marine top predators, including marine mammals, are known to bio-accumulate persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a serious conservation concern for these species. Although PCBs declined in European seas since the 1970s–1980s ban, considerable levels still persist in European and Mediterranean waters. In cetaceans, stranded animals are a valuable source of samples for pollutant studies, but may introduce both known and unknown biases. Biopsy samples from live, free-ranging cetaceans offer a better alternative for evaluating toxicological burdens of populations, especially when linked to known histories of identified individuals. We evaluated PCB and other organochlorine contaminants in free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea), one of the most human-impacted areas in the Mediterranean Sea. Biopsies were collected from 32 male and female dolphins during 2011–2017. All animals were photo-identified and are part of a well-known population of about 150 individuals monitored since 2002. We tested for the effects of sex, parity and social group membership on contaminant concentrations. Males had significantly higher organochlorine concentrations than females, suggesting offloading from reproducing females to their offspring via gestation and/or lactation. Furthermore, nulliparous females had substantially higher concentrations than parous ones, providing further support for maternal offloading of contaminants. Overall, 87.5% of dolphins had PCB concentrations above the toxicity threshold for physiological effects in experimental marine mammal studies (9 mg/kg lw), while 65.6% had concentrations above the highest threshold published for marine mammals based on reproductive impairment in ringed seals (41 mg/kg lw). The potential population-level effects of such high contaminant levels are of concern particularly in combination with other known or suspected threats to this population. We demonstrate the utility of combining contaminant data with demographic parameters such as sex, reproductive output, etc., resulting from long-term studies. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Photo-identification is a commonly used non-invasive technique that has been profitably employed in biological studies throughout the years. It starts from the assumption that a single individual can be recognized in multiple photos captured at different times by exploiting its unique representative and visible physical qualities such as marks, notches or any other definite feature. Hence, photo-identification is performed to infer knowledge about wild species' spatial and temporal distributions as well as population dynamics, thus providing valuable information especially when the species being investigated is ranked as data deficient. Furthermore, the technological improvements of the last decades and the large availability of devices with powerful computing capabilities are driving the research towards a common goal of enriching bio-ecological studies with innovative computer science approaches. In this scenario, computer vision plays a fundamental role, as it can successfully assist researchers in the analysis of large amounts of data. The aim of this paper is, in fact, to effectively provide a computer vision approach for the photo-identification of the Risso's dolphin, exploiting specific visual cues with a feature-based approach relying on SIFT and SURF feature detectors. The experiments have been conducted on image data acquired in the Gulf of Taranto from 2013 to 2017, conducting a comparative analysis of the performance of both SIFT and SURF, as well as a comparison with the state-of-the-art software DARWIN, and they proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach and suggested its application would be suitable to large scale studies. In conclusion, this paper shows an innovative computer vision application for the identification of unknown Risso's dolphin individuals that relies on a feature-based automated approach. The results suggest that the proposed approach can efficiently assist researchers during the photo-identification task of large amounts of data collected in such a challenging domain. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Dolphins of the genus Stenella occur in pelagic waters of both tropical and warm-temperate oceans. Three species, the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis), the pantropical spotted dolphin (S. attenuata), and the spinner dolphin (S. longirostris) are abundant worldwide, but in the Caribbean Basin they have been poorly studied and information on their distribution patterns is scarce. Specifically, in Colombia's remote Seaflower Biosphere Reserve (SFBR) S. attenuata has been reported occasionally, but S. frontalis and S. longirostris have never been recorded before. To address this information gap, an ecological niche modeling approach was used to determine the potential distribution patterns of these three dolphin species in the region. Records of these species for the Caribbean Basin were compiled, including both published and unpublished data. Environmental information, including bathymetry, bathymetric slope, distance to shore, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and chlorophyll-a concentration was gathered from public databases (MARSPEC and Bio-ORACLE) in raster format. The maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent) for modeling species' geographic distributions with presence-only data was used. After filtering the data, 210 records of S. attenuata, 204 of S. frontalis, and 80 of S. longirostris were used to run models. The best configuration for each model was chosen based on the ΔAICc criterion. For all three species, the final ecological niche models returned AUC test values higher than 0.8, indicating satisfactory model performance. The resulting potential distribution maps suggested that areas closest to continental shorelines of the Caribbean Basin and surrounding islands had the highest environmental suitability for all species (> 70%). All models reported high environmental suitability for S. attenuata and S. longirostris in the SFBR, mainly in the southernmost part surrounding San Andrés and Providence Archipelago. Assessment of niche overlap from the predictions of species distributions using the similarity statistic and pairwise map overlap indicated that S. frontalis and S. longirostris had niches slightly more similar in comparison to S. attenuata. As this was a first effort to fill a gap in our understanding of the distribution of species in the genus Stenella in the Caribbean Basin, further studies are necessary using both niche modeling and biological/ecological approaches. © 2019 Barragán-Barrera, do Amaral, Chávez-Carreño, Farías-Curtidor, Lancheros-Neva, Botero-Acosta, Bueno, Moreno, Bolaños-Jiménez, Bouveret, Castelblanco-Martínez, Luksenburg, Mellinger, Mesa-Gutiérrez, de Montgolfier, Ramos, Ridoux and Palacios.

ABSTRACT: Age constitutes a critical parameter for the study of animal populations, providing information about development, environmental effects, survival, and reproduction. Unfortunately, age estimation is not only challenging in large, mobile and legally protected species, but often involves invasive sampling methods. The present work investigates the association between epigenetic modifications and chronological age in small cetaceans. For that purpose, DNA methylation at age-linked genes was characterized in an extensively studied, long-term resident common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community from Sarasota Bay (FL, United States) for which sampled individuals have a known age. Results led to the identification of several CpG sites that are significantly correlated to chronological age in this species with the potential for sex to play a role in the modulation of this correlation. These findings have allowed for the development and validation of the “Bottlenose dolphin Epigenetic Age estimation Tool” (BEAT), improving minimally-invasive age estimation in free-ranging small cetaceans. Overall, the BEAT proved to be accurate in estimating age in these organisms. Given its minimally-invasive nature and potential large-scale implementation using skin biopsy samples, this tool can be used to generate age data from free-ranging small cetacean populations. © 2019 Beal, Kiszka, Wells and Eirin-Lopez.

ABSTRACT: As long-lived apex predators in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) of China, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic impact and may undergo considerable ecological trait changes. The variability of traits, however, is often difficult to trace back in nature. Here, we analyzed stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in muscle samples of 88 S. chinensis stranded in the PRE from 2004 to 2016 to investigate the ecological changes occurring in the dolphins. Stable isotope analysis revealed the existence of two sub-aggregations of S. chinensis in the PRE. Generalized additive models showed significant decreasing trends in both carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures over time, indicating the habitat changes and dietary shifts, possibly due to the influence of increased coastal developments and fishing activities in the PRE. Diet modeling suggests that the proportional contribution of higher trophic-level prey decreased in the S. chinensis diet over time, while increased consumption of lower trophic-level prey was observed. This shift was related to depletion of higher trophic-level prey caused by overfishing. Although S. chinensis could temporarily compensate for the lost energy supply through feeding plasticity (revealed by the negligible differences of isotope niche width among different stranding periods), long-term depletion in prey availability may cause long-lasting negative effects on this dolphin population. This study highlights the crucial relationships between fishery management and dolphin conservation, providing scientific evidence for the long-term protection of this threatened species in the PRE region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have unusual vaginal folds of unknown function(s) that are hypothesized to play an important role in sexual selection. The potential function of vaginal folds was assessed by testing the mechanical properties of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) reproductive tract tissues in 6 different regions and across age classes in post-mortem specimens. We assessed the regional (local) and overall effective elastic modulus of tissues using indentation and tensile tests, respectively. We explore the non-linear mechanical response of biological tissues, which are not often quantified. Indentation tests demonstrated that sexual maturity state, tissue region, force history, and force magnitude values significantly affected the measured effective elastic modulus. Tissue was stiffest in the vaginal fold region and overall stiffer in sexually immature compared to mature animals, likely reflecting biomechanical adaptations associated with copulation and parturition. Tensile tests showed that only tissue region significantly affected the effective modulus. Our data support the hypothesis that vaginal folds function as mechanical barriers to the penis and may provide females with mechanisms to reduce copulatory forces on other reproductive tissue. Statement of Significance: Cetaceans have unusual folds of vaginal wall tissue that appear to evolve under sexual selection mechanisms and present physical barriers to the penis during copulation. We explore the biomaterial properties of vaginal fold tissue, how it varies from other reproductive tract tissues, and ontogenetic patterns. We demonstrate that vaginal folds can withstand higher mechanical forces and respond in a manner conducive to dissipating copulatory forces to other reproductive tissues. This study yields exciting insights on how female genital tissue may function during copulation, and is the first to do so in any vertebrate species. Additionally, we provide an example for testing biological tissues, non-linear properties, and materials with uneven surface structure and uneven thickness. © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

ABSTRACT: A bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) housed in the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium (PNPA) presented with symptomatic pneumonia caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. The dolphin was treated with micafungin. On days 2 and 11 after the first administration of micafungin, results from a physical examination and laboratory test indicated a decline of body temperature (BT) and leukopenia, with lowest BT, white blood cells (WBCs), and segmented neutrophils (SEGs) of 34.2°C, 600 cells/µl, and 67 cells/µl, respectively. BT, WBCs, and SEGs returned to normal range after administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of micafungin-induced decline of BT and leukopenia that was successfully treated with G-CSF in a bottlenose dolphin. © 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Taxonomy plays an important role in conservation biology. Despite the variety of methods used to differentiate units, some groups, such as Delphinidae within the Cetacea have proven difficult to untangle. This study aimed to shed light on morphological variation of the genus Tursiops in South African waters using geometric morphometrics and to distinguish morphological groups and variation in these groups. A total of 241 crania of Tursiops spp. were analyzed using a suite of 2-dimensional landmarks defined on photographs of the specimens. Results revealed two distinct morphological groups, with the smaller cluster comprised mainly of specimens from the cold temperate region off the west coast and the larger cluster comprised of specimens mainly from the warm temperate and subtropical regions off the south and east coast, respectively. We suggest that these groups correspond to different species of Tursiops, but this result requires further support. These groups were treated as separate entities and sexual dimorphism and geographic variation were assessed within each group. While sexual dimorphism and geographic variation were not significant within Cluster D1 and V1, they were significant within Clusters D2 and V2. The few Cluster 1 specimens found in the warm temperate and subtropical regions, relative to the number of Cluster 2 specimens, could be an indication of an offshore distribution for this group in these regions. Alternatively, the smaller cluster may also be indicative of a potentially small population size. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (n = 360) from two southeastern U.S. estuarine sites were given comprehensive health examinations between 2003 and 2015 as part of a multi-disciplinary research project focused on individual and population health. The study sites (and sample sizes) included the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, USA (n = 246) and Charleston harbor and associated rivers (CHS), South Carolina, USA (n = 114). Results of a suite of clinicoimmunopathologic tests revealed that both populations have a high prevalence of infectious and neoplastic disease and a variety of abnormalities of their innate and adaptive immune systems. Subclinical infections with cetacean morbillivirus and Chlamydiaceae were detected serologically. Clinical evidence of orogenital papillomatosis was supported by the detection of a new strain of dolphin papillomavirus and herpesvirus by molecular pathology. Dolphins with cutaneous lobomycosis/lacaziasis were subsequently shown to be infected with a novel, uncultivated strain of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, now established as the etiologic agent of this enigmatic disease in dolphins. In this review, innate and adaptive immunologic responses are compared between healthy dolphins and those with clinical and/or immunopathologic evidence of infection with these specific viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. A wide range of immunologic host responses was associated with each pathogen, reflecting the dynamic and complex interplay between the innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immune systems in the dolphin. Collectively, these studies document the comparative innate and adaptive immune responses to various types of infectious diseases in free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Evaluation of the type, pattern, and degree of immunologic response to these pathogens provides novel insight on disease immunopathogenesis in this species and as a comparative model. Importantly, the data suggest that in some cases infection may be associated with subclinical immunopathologic perturbations that could impact overall individual and population health.

ABSTRACT: Phenotypic variations occur in several cetacean species, including common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, which can also be distinguished as coastal and offshore ecotypes. In the western South Atlantic, these ecotypes have been described based on skeletal morphology and genetics. However, there is still no clear description to recognize them in the field. Here we searched for external diagnostic patterns that may facilitate their visual distinction and investigated their habitat use. We examined dorsal fin shapes and coloration of photo-identified dolphins distributed in a wide geographic range off the coast of southern and southeastern Brazil. A strong differentiation in the dorsal fin shape was observed, with a more falcate shape for offshore dolphins. We also found that offshore individuals have a darker color pattern, while coastal dolphins show 2 wider striped bands at the throat region and a longer rostrum, revealing that the ecotypes can be well distinguished in the field. We also detected differential habitat use. The coastal ecotype inhabits shallow waters (up to 18 m deep) close to the shore (up to 3 km). The offshore ecotype has a wider distribution and more flexible habitat use. It was usually found in coastal and deeper waters (maximum depth of 758 m and >200 km from the coast). Although we observed a small area of overlap in the distribution of the 2 ecotypes, both forms were not seen together. Therefore, our results reinforce the presence of a parapatric distribution and distinct morphology between the ecotypes, supporting their prior description as different subspecies. © The authors 2019.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean mechanical senses, such as hearing, echolocation, active touch and the perception of water movements, are essential for their survival. Dolphins skin possesses dense packing of dermal papillae associated with the cutaneous ridges that suggests a sensory function, furthermore they are well innervated and very sensitive to touch. This is mediated by mechanoreceptors, abundant in the region of the head and in the dorsal part of the body. Most odontocetes possess vibrissae (i.e., sensory hair) that have been well described in literature and present a microanatomy similar to that of terrestrial mammals. The aim of this study was to characterize Merkel cell through use of specific antibodies: Substance P, Anti-calbindin DK28, Anti-5HT, Leu- enkephalin, Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP9.5) and Anti-Human Neuronal Protein, for the first time. Merkel cells (MCs) in the dolphin skin are specialized skin receptors, characterized by their particular location and close association with nerve terminals. The presence of neuroendocrine markers and different neuropeptides confirms that MCs play also neuroendocrine function and are considered as part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Furthermore, the presence of Leu-enkephalin in Merkel cells could involve these cells in inflammatory responses in the skin. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) is one of the cetacean species commonly encountered off the eastern coast of Taiwan. The species appears to occur in Taiwanese waters year-round. Many biological and ecological characteristics, including group size, habitat preference, and ages at weaning and sexual maturity, are by-and-large in accord with earlier reports for populations in other geographic regions. Morphological assessments, dietary analyses, and genetic data altogether suggest the dolphins found in Taiwanese and Japanese waters are from the same population, which exhibits high genetic diversity and a sign of recent demographic expansion. The dolphin species is endorsed a "Rare and Valuable Species (Class II)" status and is protected by the Wildlife Conservation Act in Taiwan. However, it is still vulnerable to human activities, in terms of whale-watching tourism and coastal gill-net fisheries, with a growing concern on the level of heavy metal residues found in dolphin tissues. Current knowledge for the species is mostly derived from relatively limited information. Assessments on key biological and ecological features, e.g., population size, residency, social structure, and group composition, shall be prioritised for conservation initiatives. © The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The use of different essential oils (Eos), which are considered as a good alternative to synthetic materials, is increasing day by day in fish species. Nevertheless, studies on the anesthetic effect of peppermint Eo (Mentha piperita; MPEo) and lavender Eo (Lavandula angustifolia; LAEo) are scarce. In the present study, the effective concentrations of three anesthetic materials (MPEo, LAEo, and MS-222) were previously determined in the concentrations range of 100–400 ppm in Cyrtocara moorii juveniles (4.92 ± 1.03 g and 7.13 ± 1.22 cm) with the criteria of appropriate induction time (AIt) and ready recovery time (RRt) (Trial 1). Afterwards, four different groups were established at three different sedative concentrations (10, 20, and 30 ppm and a control group without anesthetic additive) for transporting (Trial 2). The study concluded that MPEo and LAEo can be used as anesthetic and sedative agents in tropical fish species safely. The use of 100 µL L–1 (183.5 s AIt and 227.8 s RRt) and 300 µL L–1 (109.2 s AIt and 420.0 s RRt) MPEo and LAEo, respectively, was sufficient for deep anesthesia, whereas concentrations in the range of 10 to 30 µL L–1 are recommended for fish transport. © TÜBİTAK

ABSTRACT: A boat-based survey was conducted in the Tefé river and lake (Brazil) in December 2013, during the transitional water period. A combination of strip-width transects parallel to the river, lake-margins and confluences, and cross-channel line transects in the lake, were used to cover a total distance of 670 linear kilometres of the dolphins' habitat. A total of 383 groups of Amazon river dolphin and 124 groups of tucuxi were observed. Group size, density and abundance estimates were obtained per species and habitat (tributary, lake-margin and confluence). Group sizes ranged from one to six individuals for the Amazon river dolphin and from one to eight individuals for the tucuxi. The abundance of river dolphins was higher for the Amazon river dolphin (911, CV = 0.15) than the tucuxi (511, CV = 0.26). Higher densities were found in the lake-margin and tributary for the Amazon river dolphin and in the confluences for the tucuxi. Lake-margins, confluences and tributaries are therefore proposed as critical habitats for the conservation of river dolphins in central Amazonia. The Tefé lake is identified as an area of concern due to a high number of human stressors such as boat traffic, fishing and habitat degradation. © 2019 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Psychophysical methods similar to those employed with bats were used to examine jittered echo-delay resolution in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Two dolphins were trained to produce echolocation clicks and report a change from electronic echoes with a fixed delay of ~ 12.6 ms (~ 9.4 m simulated range) to echoes with delays that alternated (jittered) between successive emitted signals. Jitter delays varied from 0 to 50 µs. Jittered echo-delay thresholds were between 1 and 2 µs—the lowest achievable (non-zero) values with the hardware configuration. Error functions matched the click autocorrelation function near zero jitter delay, and were well within the envelope of the autocorrelation function; however, measured jitter delay thresholds were larger than predictions for a coherent or semicoherent receiver at comparable signal-to-noise ratios. When one of the two alternating jittered echoes was inverted in polarity, both dolphins reliably discriminated echoes at all jittered echo delays, including 0 µs (i.e., only jittering in polarity, not delay). Finally, both dolphins used unusual patterns of click emissions, where groups of echolocation clicks were interspersed with silent gaps. Further tests with sub-microsecond jitter values and various echo signal-to-noise ratios would be necessary for proper direct comparison with jitter detection values obtained for bats. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Remote biopsy sampling (RBS) is an important method to obtain epidermal samples from free-ranging cetaceans. The efficiency and effect of different RBS tools on the targeted animals remain a concern for scientists. The Paxarms Mk24c Projector (PMP) biopsy system, designed especially for small cetaceans, has proven to be practical for several small cetacean species. In the present study, we used a PMP to collect epidermal samples from free-ranging Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) distributed in coastal waters of the northern South China Sea to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the PMP system and to assess any potential adverse impacts on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Thirty-five tissue samples were obtained from 193 biopsy attempts, registering a sampling success rate of 18% in the present study. None of the dolphins that were targeted for biopsies (n = 193) using the PMP biopsy system showed any obvious adverse short-term reaction. Also, biopsy attempts, regardless of sampling success, did not significantly influence the targeted individual's reaction grade (p > 0.05). Similar to previous studies, sampling distances and Beaufort scales were key factors influencing sampling success. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that RBS on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin should be conducted within a distance of 25 m under sea state of Beaufort scale 3. A significantly higher sampling success rate was obtained when the animals were foraging and resting rather than travelling and socializing, regardless of different group sizes. The present study indicated a successful application of the PMP biopsy system for sampling from Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Chinese waters, and the PMP will contribute to studies relevant to Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin conservation for this vulnerable species throughout the world. © 2019 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Soundscapes are vital to acoustically specialized animals. Using passive acoustic monitoring data, the temporal and spectral variations in the soundscape of a Chinese white dolphin hotspot were analyzed. By cluster analysis, the 1/3 octave band power spectrum can be grouped into three bands with median overall contribution rates of 35.24, 14.14 and 30.61%. Significant diel and tidal soundscape variations were observed with a generalized linear model. Temporal patterns and frequency ranges of middle frequency band sound matched well with those of fish vocalization, indicating that fish might serve as a signal source. Dolphin sounds were mainly detected in periods involving low levels of ambient sound and without fish vocalization, which could reflect noise avoidance and passive eavesdropping behaviors engaged in by the predator. Pre-construction data can be used to assess the effects of offshore windfarms on acoustic environments and aquatic animals by comparing them with the soundscape of postconstruction and/or postmitigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Rissos dolphin occurs in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, and is one of the most common cetacean species in Taiwanese waters. This study attempted to reveal its distribution in water-depth ranges and variations in group size and composition (with or without mother-calf pairs). Based on sighting records from experienced whale-watching guides on board whale-watching boats operated in eastern Taiwan, 1630 sightings of Rissos dolphin were recorded from 3939 touring trips near Hualien County from 1998 to 2014. Comparing the frequency distribution of water depths between ship tracks and dolphin sightings, we found that Rissos dolphin commonly occurred on the continental shelf and slope, and mainly stayed in waters of 300~1500 m in depth, with a mean of 862.1 ± 12.3 m (standard error). The frequency distribution of water depths showed a significant difference between sites (deeper in the Shirti area than in the Hualien area), but no significant difference was detected among various group sizes. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution significantly varied with group composition, but not with group size. Groups with mother-calf pairs stayed in significantly shallower water, which was proposed to be related to predator avoidance. In addition, the large fluctuation in annual sighting ratios of Rissos dolphin that ranged 0.1~0.7 sightings per trip during the 17-year period may be related to variations in prey abundances, the confirmation of which requires future investigation. © 2019, College of Life Science.

ABSTRACT: An unusual mortality event (UME) of striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba occurred in the period July to December 2016 along the Italian Ionian coastline. We conducted a complete postmortem examination on 28 specimens and detected dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), by means of biomolecular analyses, in the target tissues of 17 animals. Unlike previous outbreaks occurring in the Mediterranean Sea in 2011 and 2013, we observed typical pathological changes suggestive of morbilliviral infection in an acute/subacute phase and immunohistochemical reactivity. The same findings were observed in 13 other specimens beached along the Italian coastline during 2016 with no temporal and geographical relationship with the ongoing epidemic outbreak. Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis showed that DMV sequences detected in Italy in 2016 clustered with those identified in Portugal and Galicia (Spain), representing a novel DMV strain of Atlantic origin which entered the Mediterranean Sea and affected a naïve striped dolphin population. DMV sequences detected in the previous Mediterranean outbreaks exhibited a marked genetic relatedness and diverged from those detected in cetaceans stranded along the Galician and Portuguese coasts since 2007. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: Soundscape ecology is a relatively new scientific field that uses sound to characterize ecosystems, which can be helpful in tracking species, estimating relative population sizes, and monitoring behavior and overall habitat quality. Estuarine soundscapes are acoustically rich, and sound patterns in these systems are understudied. Therefore, the goal of this study was to understand the soundscape of a deep tidal river estuary, the May River, South Carolina, USA. Acoustic recorders (DSG-Oceans) were deployed to collect sound samples for 2 min every 20 min at 6 stations from February to November 2014. Acoustic data revealed that sound pressure levels (i.e. broadband, low, and high frequency) varied spatially and temporally, exhibiting distinct rhythmic patterns. Acoustic detection rates and diversity of biophonic (e.g. snapping shrimp, fish, and bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus) and anthrophonic sounds (e.g. boat noise) were higher near the river mouth and decreased towards the headwaters. The soundscape exhibited strong temporal patterns of snapping shrimp (genus Alpheus and Synalpheus) snaps, fish calls and choruses (e.g. silver perch Bairdiella chrysoura, black drum Pogonias cromis, oyster toadfish Opsanus tau, spotted seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus, and red drum Sciaenops ocellatus), bottlenose dolphin vocalizations, and vessel noise. Depending upon the species, certain variables (i.e. location, month, day length, lunar phase, day/night, tide, and temperature anomaly) influenced sound production. These data provide new tools and baseline measurements to better understand how soundscapes can be used to gauge habitat quality and impacts of stormwater runoff, climate change, and noise pollution. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT:                              The northern Beibu Gulf is one of the major habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in China. In this habitat, the core distribution zone of humpback dolphins was confined to the Sanniang Bay (SNB) and Dafengjiang River Estuary (DRE) areas. In our present research, the sediments of 14 sampling sites across the SNB and DRE waters were collected and further conducted for microbiomic and environmental analysis to explore the ecosystem characteristics of major humpback dolphin habitats in Northern Beibu Gulf. The environmental condition includes ammonia nitrogen (NH                             4                             +                             -N), nitrate nitrogen (NO                             3                             −                             -N), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), sulfur content in the form of sulfuric acid (SO                             4                             2−                             -S), Fe, and heavy metals (including Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and As). The composition of the bacterial community was characterized by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis of the V3–V4 regions using the Illumina-based sequencing platform. The environmental characteristic of the nutrient elements and heavy metals indicated that SNB suffered more anthropogenic impact than DRE. The comparably higher concentration of NH                             4                             +                             -N, NO                             3                             −                             -N, DRP, Pb, and Cd in the SNB region was detected. The comparably higher nutrients in the SNB may have resulted in higher biomass and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) profile, which was further proved by Landsat thermal image data. The microbiome analysis showed that the DRE region was oligotrophic and SNB reflected an anaerobic environment in the sediments. Environmental factors rather than the spatial distance determined the similarity of bacterial community among different sites. Ecological associations between environmental, oceanographic, and bacterial characteristics were illustrated, which exhibited strong mutual associations. Our findings presented a feasibility that integrates empirical and remote sensing data to distinguish ecological features and evaluate ecosystem healthiness for the humpback dolphin habitats.                          © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Fraser’s dolphin (Lagenodelphis hosei Fraser, 1956) is one of the least known and most recently described species in the family Delphinidae, and its complete mitogenome has yet to be determined. Herein, we report the first complete mitogenome of L. hosei. The newly obtained 16,390 bp L. hosei mitogenome showed the highest average nucleotide identity value with the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis, 97.3%), and its overall structure was similar to those from other delphinid species. Multigene phylogeny using the 13 protein coding genes in the mitogenome revealed that L. hosei was well clustered with other species within the subfamily Delphininae, and the overall tree topology was congruent with recent phylogenetic studies of this species. These results provide important insights for conservation genetics and further evolutionary studies of the oceanic dolphins. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The southern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii) is a seldom seen cetacean of southern latitudes. In the eastern South Pacific, there are less than 73 confirmed records of live and stranded animals. Moreover, all live individual records have been sighted in offshore and deep waters, but not in the shallow water of the channels and fjords of southern Chile. Two sightings of southern right whale dolphins were made on March 21 and April 7, 2018 at Ballena Sound and Charles Islands in the western area of Magellan Strait. All individuals were identified as putative adults. Both sightings may correspond to the same group of animals and, if this assumption is correct, the dolphins would have stayed at least 17 days in the area. Even though it is not clear whether the southern right whale dolphins were initially present in the Magellan Strait, or what route they took from the open sea and what biological and physical properties were determinants for this presence, without a doubt, the occurrence of southern right whale dolphins in the eastern South Pacific channel systems is unusual. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT:   DNA barcode data of both endangered dolphin species, Platanista gangetica, and Orcaella brevirostris are lacking in the global database. The study generated partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene sequences of the two highly threatened dolphin species from India. The family Platanistidae with one species and family Delphinidae with 12 species were showed 1.2%–19.7% between species genetic divergence in the studied dataset. Both P. gangetica and O. brevirostris were revealed distinct clade in neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogeny. Further, D. delphis, S. coeruleoalba, and T. truncatus have shown more than one clade and comparatively high genetic divergence within the species suggested prominent genetic variation between different populations. The study recommends generating more DNA barcode data from diverse habitats of P. gangetica and O. brevirostris to evaluate the exact population structure and adopting better conservation strategies thereafter. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Fecal samples collected from free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (BDs) in the Indian River Lagoon of Florida were processed for viral discovery using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach. A 693-bp contig identified in the NGS data was nearly identical to the partial L1 gene sequence of a papillomavirus (PV) previously found in a penile papilloma in a killer whale (Orcinus orca). Based on this partial bottlenose dolphin papillomavirus (BDPV) sequence, a nested inverse PCR and primer-walking strategy was employed to generate the complete genome sequence. The full BDPV genome consisted of 7299 bp and displayed a typical PV genome organization. The BDPV E6 protein contained a PDZ-binding motif, which has been shown to be involved in carcinogenic transformation involving high-risk genital human PVs. Screening of 12 individual fecal samples using a specific endpoint PCR assay revealed that the feces from a single female BD displaying a genital papilloma was positive for the BDPV. Genetic analysis indicated that this BDPV (Tursiops truncatus papillomavirus 8; TtPV8) is a new type of Dyopipapillomavirus 1, previously sequenced from an isolate obtained from a penile papilloma in a harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Although only a partial L1 sequence has been determined for a PV detected in a killer whale genital papilloma, our finding of a nearly identical sequence in an Atlantic BD may indicate that members of this viral species are capable of host jumping. Future work is needed to determine if this virus is a high-risk PV that is capable of inducing carcinogenic transformation and whether it poses a significant health risk to wild delphinid populations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) levels were assessed in the liver and muscle of two data-deficient threatened dolphin species, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, n = 4) and the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis, n = 6), sampled off the Southeastern Brazilian coast. PCB concentrations were greater in liver compared to muscle, with males presenting higher concentrations than females. The three main detected PCB congeners were PCBs 138, 153 and 180. A predominance of hexachlorinated congeners was observed, followed by hepta- and penta-PCBs. For both species, Cl 3 and Cl 4 levels were higher in muscle compared to liver, while Cl 5 to Cl 8 and ∑PCBs were higher in liver. PBDE concentrations were significantly higher in Atlantic spotted dolphin muscle and liver compared to bottlenose dolphins. Similarly to PCBs, the highest PBDE concentrations were observed in males. The presence of PBDE congeners BDE-47, -100 and -99 in the muscle and liver of both species suggests the existence of a pollution source in Brazil by a penta-BDE mixture, as PBDEs have never been produced in Brazil. Interspecific PCB and PBDE profiles were very similar, which may be related to the similar characteristics of the analyzed species, mainly geographic distribution and life and feeding habits. This study furthers knowledge on environmental PCB and PBDE contamination, assisting in the establishment of dolphin population conservation strategies. In addition, this study calls into question the current threshold values established for PCBs and PBDEs, and demonstrates the lack of information and knowledge in this regard for cetaceans. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Man-made environmental change may have significant impact on apex predators, like marine mammals. Thus, it is important to assess the physiological boundaries for survival in these species, and assess how climate change may affect foraging efficiency and the limits for survival. In the current study, we investigated whether the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) could estimate tidal volume (VT) in resting bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). For this purpose, we measured respiratory flow and electrocardiogram (ECG) in five adult bottlenose dolphins at rest while breathing voluntarily. Initially, an exponential decay function, using three parameters (baseline heart rate, the change in heart rate following a breath, and an exponential decay constant) was used to describe the temporal change in instantaneous heart rate following a breath. The three descriptors, in addition to body mass, were used to develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to predict the inspired tidal volume (VTinsp). The GAM allowed us to predict VTinsp with an average (± SD) overestimate of 3 ± 2%. A jackknife sensitivity analysis, where 4 of the five dolphins were used to fit the GAM and the 5th dolphin used to make predictions resulted in an average overestimate of 2 ± 10%. Future studies should be used to assess whether similar relationships exist in active animals, allowing VT to be studied in free-ranging animals provided that heart rate can be measured.

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are found in temperate and tropical waters of the world across a wide range of habitats. Along Florida's north-western coast, this species resides in the bays, sounds, and estuaries (BSE) and coastal (CST) waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The National Marine Fisheries Service has identified one CST (Northern Coastal Stock) and seven adjacent BSE dolphin stocks, including the St Andrew Bay BSE Stock. Baseline data are critical to assess the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic stressors on these stocks. Currently, there is no comprehensive abundance estimate for the St Andrew Bay BSE Stock, and there are limited data on distribution patterns and site fidelity for this stock. In addition, little is known about the Northern Coastal Stock hypothesized to range from the Big Bend of Florida to the Mississippi River Delta, inclusive of the CST waters adjacent to St Andrew Bay. The goals of this study were to conduct photographic-identification surveys during 2015 and 2016 to determine abundance, distribution, and site fidelity of common bottlenose dolphins in the St Andrew Bay BSE Stock over four primary periods (July and October 2015, and April and October 2016). St Andrew Bay BSE dolphin abundance was lowest in April 2016 (199, 95% confidence interval [CI] 173–246), followed by July 2015 (249, 95% CI 199–338), and highest in October 2015 (299, 95% CI 259–361) and October 2016 (315, 95% CI 274–378). Few individuals were sighted in both BSE and CST waters (N = 25/353; 7%), and this fact, taken in tandem with limited connections between the BSE and CST environments, suggests that there may be minimal overlap between the St Andrew Bay BSE and Northern Coastal Stocks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The coastal population of common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus found in Namibia is regionally isolated and unique. This population faces several potential anthropogenic threats, especially in Walvis Bay, including boat-based tourism, a commercial harbour undergoing expansion, and aquaculture for oysters and mussels. Between 2008 and 2012, 238 boat-based surveys were conducted, resulting in 170 encounters with bottlenose dolphins. Overall, group sizes varied from 1 to 45 individuals (mean 10.7). Encounter rates, group sizes and total numbers of animals identified were higher in winter than in summer field seasons. The number, and survival and immigration parameters, of bottlenose dolphins using Walvis Bay was investigated using robust design and Huggins closed-population mark-recapture models. The highest numbers estimated were in the first and last years of the study, with estimates of 74–82 in 2008 and 76–77 in 2012 (numbers identified and upper 95% confidence limits). The only previously available data, from an incomplete study in the early 1990s, suggested that the population was between 100 and 150 individuals at the time. Although no linear trend in population size was obvious during the current study, the clear evidence of isolation, small population size, low annual birth rate, and potential long-term decrease in numbers since the early 1990s is concerning. Further work to collect data on demographic parameters is urgently recommended with a view to obtaining increased protection for this species. © 2019, © 2019 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin skin has long been an inspiration for research on drag reduction mechanisms due to the presence of skin ridges that could reduce fluid resistance. We gathered in vivo three-dimensional surface data on the skin from five species of odontocetes to quantitatively examine skin texture, including the presence and size of ridges. We used these data to calculate k+ values, which relate surface geometry to changes in boundary layer flow. Our results showed that while ridge size differs among species, odontocete skin was surprisingly smooth compared to the skin of other swimmers (average roughness = 5.3 mm). In addition, the presence of ridges was variable among individuals of the same species. We predict that odontocete skin ridges do not alter boundary layer flows at cruising swimming speeds. By combining k+ values and morphological data, our work provides evidence that skin ridges are unlikely to be an adaptation for drag reduction and that odontocete skin is exceptionally smooth compared to other pelagic swimmers. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sixteen per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were measured in liver (n = 52) and kidney (n = 18) tissues of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) stranded in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) of China between 2004 and 2016. The average concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and most of other PFASs in the liver samples were respectively greater than any records previously reported in cetaceans globally. PFOS levels in 46% of dolphin liver samples exceeded the hepatic toxicity threshold in cetaceans. For the first time, we found a U-shaped trend for the distribution pattern of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) between liver and kidney with increasing carbon chain lengths (C5-C16), whereas a descending trend (C4-C10) was found for perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFASs), which may be explained by binding efficiencies of PFAS analogues to proteins. Dolphins with the highest levels of ∑PFASs (age-corrected) were clustered near the river outlets in Lingdingyang area, which agrees with the spatial distribution of PFASs in the environment. Significant temporal trends were observed for many PFASs. Concentrations of PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) all peaked in year 2011, followed by a decreasing trend, while a consistently descending trend was shown for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS). Our findings contribute to the knowledge of tissue distribution and spatiotemporal trends of PFASs in the PRE dolphins, which are valuable for us to understand the PFASs exposure risk and their industrial emission in Southern China. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Information about the social relations among individuals is essential to define and develop management plans for a socially structured population. Association data for 25 adult Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins were obtained from 189 photo-identification surveys that took place between January 2007 and May 2009 in La Coronilla-Cerro Verde and Cabo Polonio, Rocha, Uruguay. Group size averaged 5.22 individuals (SD= 3.77, n= 255). Coefficients of association were calculated using the Half-Weight Index. Most of the associations were weak (79.7%) and variation of real association indices was greater than would be expected by chance. Thus, the null hypothesis that individuals associated randomly was rejected. Standardized Lagged Association Rate analysis also indicated that nonrandom associations between individuals persisted over the study period. The exponential decay model that fits best to the data suggested the existence of constant companions and casual acquaintances. This study is the first report about the social structure of the population of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin inhabiting the Uruguayan marine coasts. Cerro Verde and Cabo Polonio were the first marine protected areas selected by the government of Uruguay. However, information about the ecology and behavior of the species in these areas is still insufficient. It is recommended that the results of this study be taken as baseline information to assess the conservation status of this population, as well as for the development of adequate conservation and management plans. © SAREM, 2019.

ABSTRACT: We inspected dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) group dynamics in Golfo Nuevo and found differences in social organization between cold and warm seasons. Surveys were conducted onboard a research vessel, from which we collected behavioral observations and group fission-fusion data from 2001 to 2008; we also collected photo-identification data from 2004 to 2012. To analyze association patterns, we calculated half-weight association index (HWI) and social differentiation (S). We conducted a Monte Carlo permutation test to determine whether observed association patterns were significantly different from random association using a compiled version of SOCPROG 2.7. Group fission and fusion dynamics depended on group behavior, the main activity after the groups' fusion was feeding, and they never fission before socializing. The social structure of dusky dolphins included long-term preferred companions in the cold season; during the warm season, there were no preferred companions. This seasonal difference in social structure could be related to an accompanying shift in foraging behaviors that appears to be driven by changes in prey availability. If so, then a loosening of bonds among individuals during the warm season, when prey is more available, would reflect these social structure changes. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: We measured respiratory flow (V ), breathing frequency (fR), tidal volume (VT), breath duration and end-expired O2 content in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) before and after static surface breath-holds ranging from 34 to 292 s. There was considerable variation in the end-expired O2, VT and fR following a breath-hold. The analysis suggests that the dolphins attempt to minimize recovery following a dive by altering VT and fR to rapidly replenish the O2 stores. For the first breath following a surface breath-hold, the end-expired O2 decreased with dive duration, while VT and fR increased. Throughout the recovery period, end-expired O2 increased while the respiratory effort (VT, fR) decreased. We propose that the dolphins alter respiratory effort following a breath-hold according to the reduction in end-expired O2 levels, allowing almost complete recovery after 1.2 min. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are typically regarded as highly social animals. However, some individuals live apart from their own species and may come to socialize with people through a recognized series of stages which are presented and expanded on in this paper. The term "solitary-sociable dolphins" has been used to describe these animals and such individuals have been identified from several different species and reported in many parts of the world. In many instances, the interactions with people that may follow their original isolation, and which typically become more intense over time, have created situations where the welfare of the animal has been compromised by disturbance, injury, the feeding of inappropriate items and aggressive human behavior. Several solitary-sociable dolphins have also been deliberately injured and killed by humans. People who interact with these dolphins may also put themselves at risk of injury. This paper reports on recent cases drawing on published and unpublished sources. Since 2008, 32 solitary dolphins have been recorded including 27 bottlenose dolphins (25 Tursiops truncatus and two Tursiops aduncus), two striped dolphins and three common dolphins. Four solitary belugas have also been recorded. There are some ten solitary dolphins and one beluga known at the present time. Laws and guidelines currently in place to protect solitary-sociable dolphins need to be strengthened and interactions with people should be avoided or, at the least, carefully managed to protect both the dolphin and the humans involved in the interaction. Terms, such as disturbance and harassment which are included in laws need to be clearly defined. Additionally, management plans for solitary-sociable dolphins need to be developed and adapted on a case by case basis taking into account the individual dolphin's sex, age, personality, stage of sociability and home range. It is also important that government officials and local stakeholders work together to implement guidelines which set out how the public can observe or interact with the dolphin safely. © 2019 Nunny and Simmonds.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean populations can adjust their sound repertoire depending on the environment they are in, their population structure and the activities they are performing. Our goal was to characterize and compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, the sound repertoire of Sotalia guianensis in two areas of south-eastern and southern Brazil. We expected to find similar sound repertoires between the two regions, as they are geographically close and are part of the same complex estuarine. Acoustical parameters of the whistles, burst pulses and clicks were recorded during both daytime and night-time hours. They were compared between areas through Chi-square and Mann–Whitney tests. The samples resulted in 3,630 recorded whistles, 631 burst pulses and 44 low-frequency narrow-band sounds, with echolocation clicks present in 50.98% of the total minutes analysed. The occurrence rate of all sounds and the acoustic parameters of the whistles and clicks differed between the two areas, so our initial hypothesis was rejected. We highlighted environmental differences, behaviour exhibited by animals, number of individuals and group size and low exchange of individuals between areas as possible explanations that might account for these results, based on our knowledge of the species and areas of study, as well as a substantial literature on the physical and biological characteristics of the sounds. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) and pantropical spotted dolphins (S. attenuata) show high intraspecific morphological diversity and endemic subspecies in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA have found low genetic differentiation among most of these groups, possibly due to demographic factors, ongoing gene flow, and/or recent divergence. These species were heavily depleted due to bycatch in the ETP yellowfin tuna fishery. Because understanding population structure is important for accurate management of the recovery of these species, we collected whole mitochondrial genome sequences from 104 spinner and 76 spotted dolphins to test structure hypotheses at multiple hierarchical taxonomic levels. Results show differences between subspecies of spinner and spotted dolphins, but no support for the division of existing offshore stocks of spotted dolphins. We compare these results to previous results of genome-wide nuclear SNP data and suggest high haplotype diversity, female dispersal, and/or relative power of the two data sets explains the differences observed. Interestingly, increasing the amount of mitochondrial data (base pairs and genes) did not increase ability to delimit population units. This study supports a genetic basis for management units at the subspecies level, and provides critical information for mitigating historical and continued fisheries impacts. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Infectious diseases are significant demographic and evolutionary drivers of populations, but studies about the genetic basis of disease resistance and susceptibility are scarce in wildlife populations. Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a highly contagious disease that is increasing in both geographic distribution and incidence, causing unusual mortality events (UME) and killing tens of thousands of individuals across multiple cetacean species worldwide since the late 1980s. The largest CeMV outbreak in the Southern Hemisphere reported to date occurred in Australia in 2013, where it was a major factor in a UME, killing mainly young Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). Using cases (nonsurvivors) and controls (putative survivors) from the most affected population, we carried out a genome-wide association study to identify candidate genes for resistance and susceptibility to CeMV. The genomic data set consisted of 278,147,988 sequence reads and 35,493 high-quality SNPs genotyped across 38 individuals. Association analyses found highly significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies among cases and controls at 65 SNPs, and Random Forests conservatively identified eight as candidates. Annotation of these SNPs identified five candidate genes (MAPK8, FBXW11, INADL, ANK3 and ACOX3) with functions associated with stress, pain and immune responses. Our findings provide the first insights into the genetic basis of host defence to this highly contagious disease, enabling the development of an applied evolutionary framework to monitor CeMV resistance across cetacean species. Biomarkers could now be established to assess potential risk factors associated with these genes in other CeMV-affected cetacean populations and species. These results could also possibly aid in the advancement of vaccines against morbilliviruses. © 2018 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The mosaics of Delos island are a significant body of the ancient Greek art of the Hellenistic period that are inscribed to UNESCO’s World Heritage List. In this study, GPR systems with frequencies of 1600MHz, 500MHz and 250MHz are used to evaluate the stratigraphic condition of the mosaic at house of the Dolphins that decorates the peristyle impluvium. All the obtained data were processed in MATLAB and both Bscans and depth slices were used for the interpretation. The 1600MHz system performed the best and it was possible to identify the boundaries of the mosaic layers as well as problematic areas, such as bulges and high levels of moisture that may cause deterioration. The results obtained from the 500MHz and 250MHz are complimentary to the ones obtained from the high frequency system as the emitted signals can reach deeper levels. Structural characteristics of the cistern below the main mosaic floor were mapped in some detail including five stone arches. The overall performance of the GPR was satisfactory and the resulted information will be taken into account for the upcoming conservation plans.

ABSTRACT: The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea (G. Cuvier, 1829)) is the most endangered marine mammal species in South Africa, and the overall decline of its abundance and group size may affect the social organisation of the species, potentially accentuating its vulnerability. Understanding the social organisation is therefore particularly relevant to conservation efforts. From photo-identification surveys along the south coast of South Africa from March 2014 to June 2015, we quantified association patterns and investigated the social organisation of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins using the half-weight index, social cluster, and network analyses. During the 101 surveys conducted and 553 h of survey effort, 98 sightings of dolphins were recorded and 65 individuals identified. Using individuals seen at least three times, this study reveals that the social network is well differentiated, as strong social divisions exist between individuals that seem to be split into four distinctive social clusters. Network strength was low; approximately half of the associations were low to moderate, whereas some individuals were strongly associated, especially between four pairs of individuals. Although this study is based on a limited number of individuals, our study nevertheless suggests that the atypical strong social bonds recorded here could result from behavioural responses following the decline in group size and abundance. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

ABSTRACT: In the Port of Koper new Ro-Ro berth for ships of length of about 240 m is planned. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a new berth with several breasting and mooring dolphins. The conventional concept is to transfer the horizontal ship forces to the ground via embedded steel pile or group of piles, where piles are embedded into the ground and loads transmitted directly from the pile(s) into the ground. As it was found out that thick deposit of very soft soils below the seabed is unable to provide the necessary lateral support to the steel pile. Thus, alternative design had to be adopted. To reduce the lateral pressures on the pile-soil interface and to increase the load capacity and lateral stiffness, an additional reinforced concrete (RC) block was initially proposed at the level of the seabed floor in order to transfer more load into the soil. However, due to the thick-ness of very soft soil below the seabed, this measure proved to be insufficient. Therefore, the idea was to sup-port the concrete block with 4 additional steel piles in order to maximize the load transfer from the main pile to the supporting structure at the seabed level and to increase lateral stiffness. Several nonlinear numerical 3D analyses were made considering different designs and constitutive soil models. For the steel pile and RC block elastic behavior was adopted. The 26.8m long pile supported by RC block and additional piles φ508mm were adopted as final design. © The authors and IGS: All rights reserved, 2019.

ABSTRACT: Behavioural differences among social groups can arise from differing ecological conditions, genetic predispositions and/or social learning. In the past, social learning has typically been inferred as responsible for the spread of behaviour by the exclusion of ecological and genetic factors. This 'method of exclusion' was used to infer that 'sponging', a foraging behaviour involving tool use in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population in Shark Bay, Western Australia, was socially transmitted. However, previous studies were limited in that they never fully accounted for alternative factors, and that social learning, ecology and genetics are not mutually exclusive in causing behavioural variation. Here, we quantified the importance of social learning on the diffusion of sponging, for the first time explicitly accounting for ecological and genetic factors, using a multinetwork version of 'network-based diffusion analysis'. Our results provide compelling support for previous findings that sponging is vertically socially transmitted from mother to (primarily female) offspring. This research illustrates the utility of social network analysis in elucidating the explanatory mechanisms behind the transmission of behaviour in wild animal populations. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Environmental Protected Area of Anhatomirim (EPAA) located in the Southern coast of Brazil, at Santa Catarina State, is a multiple-use Marine Protected Area (MPA), established to protect the southernmost population of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) and its habitats. Boat tourism is an important marine activity, carrying annually around 150,000 tourists, turning the EPAA into the most visited place to cetacean watch in South America. We describe the experience of managing boat tourism, highlighting the deployment of the Dolphin Monitoring Program. We discuss its strengths and limitations, considering the data from the participatory monitoring conducted since 2014, and from interviews made with all the boat owners. Our results indicate the conflicts among the main stakeholders were reduced, and the monitoring program was able to provide important short-term and intense time-series information on the dolphins’ location and on the boat tourism activity previously unavailable. Notwithstanding, a series of constraints remain, and among others we indicate the need to go beyond the current focus on the commercial benefits of the activity and to combine the participatory monitoring data with those from scientific survey cruises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We have successfully isolated cells with stem-like properties from bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) umbilical cord. Our results show that this cetacean species has embryonic fetal and adult stem cells as do humans and other studied mammals. This accomplishment allows to eventually investigate whether dolphins, due to their unique adaptations to aquatic environments, have special stem cell lineages or distinctive mechanisms of cell programming. Further characterization of their potency to differentiate into multiple cell lineages would fulfill numerous applicative purposes. We characterized, developed and refined a new protocol for obtaining potential stem cells from umbilical cord tissues of the bottlenose dolphin. Tissue samples were taken from umbilical cords of successful deliveries immediately after placenta ejection and collection from the water. Umbilical cord samples (2-3 cm3) were excised and subjected to enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation. Viable cells from specimens resident in the Oceanografic Valencia were cultured and subsequently isolated and tested for pluripotent characteristics (cell morphology, phenotype and expression of surface markers). Cell viability was confirmed also after freezing/thawing. The established protocol is suitable for collection/isolation/culture of dolphin potential mesenchymal stem cells from dolphin umbilical cord, which can be deposited in cell banks for future research needs. © 2019 UPV/EHU Press.

ABSTRACT: The Ganges river dolphin (GRD) is an obligate freshwater cetacean that inhabits the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM), and Karnaphuli-Sangu river basins of India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The other sub-species, Indus river dolphin, is distributed in the disjunct lower Indus basin of India and Pakistan. The global population and distribution range of the GRD has declined in the recent past, and thus the sub-species has been listed ‘Endangered’ by IUCN since 1996. In Assam (India), the Ganges sub-species occurs in the Barak and the Brahmaputra river systems. The Barak river is a tributary of the Meghna river, and is the upstream distribution range of the sub-species in this branch of the GBM river basin. The dolphin inhabits meanderings and confluences of rivers, with prevalence of eddy counter-current and the resultant high aquatic diversity, including prey fish abundance. In the 1970 s–1980 s, the cetacean used to be fairly common in the Barak river system. Of late, it has been extirpated from the tributaries of the Barak river, and currently no longer occurs in any part of the main channel as well. However, it continues to occur in the downstream Kushiyara river (a distributary of the Barak river) which suggests a decline in the upstream distribution range by approximately 135 km. The major factors which affected the decline and the extirpation of the cetacean from the Barak river system include poaching, by-catches and interactions with fisheries including prey-fish depletion, and habitat destruction and fragmentation due to construction of sluice gates, embankments, siltation of rivers, dredging, extraction of water for irrigation and domestic uses, aquatic pollution, and lack of awareness. Thus, for effective conservation of the dolphin, these threats need to be eliminated or managed. This article provides an exhaustive review of the distribution (past and present), population, ecology, threats and conservation recommendations of the GRD in the Barak river system of Assam, India. Further, the article includes data obtained from the recent surveys conducted by the authors in the Barak river system. © 2019 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde

ABSTRACT: One of many challenges in the conservation of biodiversity is the recent trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events [1]. The Shark Bay World Heritage Area, Western Australia, endured an unprecedented marine heatwave in 2011. Catastrophic losses of habitat-forming seagrass meadows followed [2], along with mass mortalities of invertebrate and fish communities [3]. Our long-term demographic data on Shark Bay's resident Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population revealed a significant decline in female reproductive rates following the heatwave. Moreover, capture–recapture analyses indicated 5.9% and 12.2% post-heatwave declines in the survival of dolphins that use tools to forage and those that do not, respectively. This implies that the tool-using dolphins may have been somewhat buffered against the cascading effects of habitat loss following the heatwave by having access to a less severely affected foraging niche [4]. Overall, however, lower survival has persisted post-heatwave, suggesting that habitat loss following extreme weather events may have prolonged, negative impacts on even behaviourally flexible, higher-trophic level predators.

ABSTRACT: Habitat configuration is an important baseline to delineate protected area design, refine impact mitigation measures and define habitat protection plans for threatened species. For coastal delphinids, outlining their habitat configuration becomes a real challenge when faced with large distribution ranges that straddle international borders, leaving broad information gaps in uninvestigated areas. This study projected likely habitats of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in the Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin) based on occurrence data and remotely sensed oceanographic characteristics. Net primary productivity was derived to measure the ecosystem service of humpback dolphin habitats. Bathymetry and chlorophyll-a concentration are major variables contributing to humpback dolphin habitat configuration, which is characterized by shallow water depth and high primary productivity. Three major, likely habitats were identified in the northern Beibu Gulf from western Leizhou Peninsula to the China–Vietnam border, western Gulf of Tonkin from the Red River estuary to the central coast of Vietnam, and south-western Hainan Island. Less than 9% of likely habitats are currently protected by marine protected areas. Affinity to high primary productivity and shallow depths implies that prey abundance and foraging efficiency influence habitat selection by Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Anthropogenic activities potentially altering oceanographic characteristics may impact regional marine ecosystem functions, and hence habitat configuration. Habitat protection actions for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins include implementing coordinated and systematic surveys in major habitats, associating core habitat protection with protected area networks and maritime function zoning, ensuring ecosystem function integrity within major habitats, and reducing both explicit lethal impacts and implicit anthropogenic impacts from activities that change oceanographic features. The habitat protection plan should not only consider marine habitats, but also adjacent coastal landscapes and river catchments. This requires coordination, collaboration and information sharing between scientific research teams, government policy representatives, non-governmental organizations, local communities and other interested stakeholders. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV; Paramyxoviridae) causes epizootic and interepizootic fatalities in odontocetes and mysticetes worldwide. Studies suggest there is different species-specific susceptibility to CeMV infection, with striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) ranking among the most susceptible cetacean hosts. The pathogenesis of CeMV infection is not fully resolved. Since no previous studies have evaluated the organ-specific immunopathogenetic features of CeMV infection in tissues from infected dolphins, this study was aimed at characterizing and comparing immunophenotypic profiles of local immune responses in lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen), lung and CNS in CeMV-molecularly (RT-PCR)-positive cetaceans from Western Mediterranean, Northeast-Central, and Southwestern Atlantic. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses targeted molecules of immunologic interest: caspase 3, CD3, CD20, CD57, CD68, FoxP3, MHCII, Iba1, IFNγ, IgG, IL4, IL10, lysozyme, TGFβ, and PAX5. We detected consistent CeMV-associated inflammatory response patterns. Within CNS, inflammation was dominated by CD3+ (T cells), and CD20+ and PAX5+ (B cells) lymphocytes, accompanied by fewer Iba1+, CD68+, and lysozyme+ histiocytes, mainly in striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Multicentric lymphoid depletion was characterized by reduced numbers of T cells and B cells, more pronounced in Guiana dolphins. Striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins often had hyperplastic (regenerative) phenomena involving the aforementioned cell populations, particularly chronically infected animals. In the lung, there was mild to moderate increase in T cells, B cells, and histiocytes. Additionally, there was a generalized increased expression of caspase 3 in lymphoid, lung, and CNS tissues. Apoptosis, therefore, is believed to play a major role in generalized lymphoid depletion and likely overt immunosuppression during CeMV infection. No differences were detected regarding cytokine immunoreactivity in lymph nodes, spleen, and lung from infected and non-infected dolphins by semiquantitative analysis; however, there was striking immunoreactivity for IFNγ in the CNS of infected dolphins. These novel results set the basis for tissue-specific immunophenotypic responses during CeMV infection in three highly susceptible delphinid species. They also suggest a complex interplay between viral and host's immune factors, thereby contributing to gain valuable insights into similarities, and differences of CeMV infection's immunopathogenesis in relation to body tissues, CeMV strains, and cetacean hosts. © 2019 Díaz-Delgado, Groch, Ressio, Riskallah, Sierra, Sacchini, Quesada-Canales, Arbelo, Fernàndez, Santos-Neto, Ikeda, Carvalho, Azevedo, Lailson-Brito, Flach, Kanamura, Fernandes, Cogliati, Centelleghe, Mazzariol, Di Renzo, Di Francesco, Di Guardo and Catão-Dias.

ABSTRACT: The history of whale and dolphin (cetacean) research in Angolan waters is scant. Prior to the 2000s it primarily consisted of information from historical (1700s to the 1920s) and modern (1920s–1970s) whaling catches, from which baleen whales and the sperm whale were confirmed. Very few species were added to Angola’s cetacean checklist between the whaling era and the 2000s. However, observations since 2003 have confirmed Angola as a range state for at least 28 species, comprising seven baleen whales, two sperm whale species, at least two beaked whales, and at least 17 delphinids. There is potential for approximately seven more species to be identified in the region based on their known worldwide distributions. Angola has one of the most diverse cetacean faunas in Africa, and indeed worldwide, due to its varied seabed topography and transitional ocean climate which supports both (sub)tropical species and those associated with the Benguela Current. While no cetacean species are truly endemic to Angola, the country is one of few confirmed range states for the Critically Endangered Atlantic humpback dolphin and the Benguela-endemic Heaviside’s dolphin. Those species, together with endangered baleen whales and breeding populations of sperm and humpback whales, are highlighted as conservation priorities. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Studies using teeth to estimate age in marine mammals presume that the neonatal line (NNL) develops at birth. This study of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus (Ehrenberg, 1833)) is the first to investigate when the NNL appears in odontocete dentine. Two to four teeth were prepared by decalcification, thin-sectioning, and staining for 103 dolphins, including 7 dolphins of known age. Tooth length, prenatal and postnatal dentine and NNL widths were measured. Developmental class (foetus, young neonate, older neonate, <1-year-old calf, 1-year-old calf) was assigned using carcass external features. NNL presence or absence was categorised for individual dolphins. The NNL was absent in a near-term foetus and all except one young neonate and fully formed in 50% of older neonates, whose estimated ages were 1 week to 2 months. It was absent in a known-age dolphin aged 4–7 weeks. NNL width was greater in dolphins less than 1 year old compared with those that were 1 year old. Factors that trigger NNL development are unknown. The present study suggests that the NNL may not be related to birth per se in dolphins, as has been clearly demonstrated in humans. Physiological processes, driven by diet, and behavioural changes during the first few months of postnatal life may be important drivers for NNL formation in odontocetes. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Air-breathing marine predators must balance the conflicting demands of oxygen conservation during breath-hold and the cost of diving and locomotion to capture prey. However, it remains poorly understood how predators modulate foraging performance when feeding at different depths and in response to changes in prey distribution and type. Here, we used high-resolution multi-sensor tags attached to Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and concurrent prey surveys to quantify their foraging performance over a range of depths and prey types. Dolphins (N = 33) foraged in shallow and deep habitats [seabed depths less or more than 560 m, respectively] and within the deep habitat, in vertically stratified prey features occurring at several aggregation levels. Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicated that dive kinematics were driven by foraging depth rather than habitat. Bottom-phase duration and number of buzzes (attempts to capture prey) per dive increased with depth. In deep dives, dolphins were gliding for > 50% of descent and adopted higher pitch angles both during descent and ascents, which was likely to reduce energetic cost of longer transits. This lower cost of transit was counteracted by the record of highest vertical swim speeds, rolling maneuvers and stroke rates at depth, together with a 4-fold increase in the inter-buzz interval (IBI), suggesting higher costs of pursuing, and handling prey compared to shallow-water feeding. In spite of the increased capture effort at depth, dolphins managed to keep their estimated overall metabolic rate comparable across dive types. This indicates that adjustments in swimming modes may enable energy balance in deeper dives. If we think of the surface as a central place where divers return to breathe, our data match predictions that central place foragers should increase the number and likely quality of prey items at greater distances. These dolphins forage efficiently from near-shore benthic communities to depth-stratified scattering layers, enabling them to maximize their fitness. © 2019 Arranz, Benoit-Bird, Friedlaender, Hazen, Goldbogen, Stimpert, DeRuiter, Calambokidis, Southall, Fahlman and Tyack.

ABSTRACT: Seasonal and interannual (El Niño-La Niña) variations in dolphin distributions in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have not been quantified, in spite of an extensive research vessel database. Fisheries observer data from the yellowfin tuna purse-seine fishery, collected year-round from 1986 through 2015, were used to construct a binned spatiotemporal dataset of the presence/absence of spotted, spinner and common dolphin schools by month and 1° area. Distribution patterns were predicted from generalised additive logistic regression models applied to the binned data, with dynamic predictors of surface temperature and salinity, thermocline depth and a stratification index. The dolphin taxa, especially common dolphins, show some niche separation in relation to these variables. Predicted distributions for each taxon showed seasonal and interannual differences. Spotted and spinner dolphins responded to changes in the position and size of the eastern Pacific warm pool and avoided the equatorial cold tongue in September-October and during La Niña. Common dolphins responded to seasonal and interannual changes in the Costa Rica Dome, the cold tongue, and the coastal upwelling habitat along Baja California, Peru and Ecuador. These predicted temporal variations are consistent with changes in preferred habitat driven by environmental variability. © 2019 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The present study, the first to examine breeding ability in elderly cetaceans, addressed the reproductive capacity of four captive male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins that are among the oldest in the world (47-50 years in 2017). The dolphins' reproductive ability was assessed by monthly monitoring of serum testosterone (T) levels over nine years (2009-2017), and examination of semen characteristics. Serum T concentrations from blood samples were measured by fluorescence immunoassay. The dolphins showed regular peaks in their serum T levels every year or once every few years. The mean monthly T level showed a significant seasonal change, beginning to elevate in January, peaking from March to May, and then declining until September. Semen production was confirmed in three of the four individuals, and semen quality was confirmed for those dolphins through collections one or two times a month for a year. The sperm concentration in samples from those individuals was comparatively high. These data indicated that the dolphins had the capacity to breed every year. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are capable of surviving to older ages in captivity than they typically reach in the wild, and it is likely that even elderly individuals retain their breeding ability. © The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: This study was conducted to characterize immunoreactive thyroid hormone concentrations in wild Amazon river dolphins, also called boto (Inia geoffrensis) by age group, sex, pregnancy and lactation status, and to determine if thyroid hormone concentration differences could be detected between pregnant females with and without successful parturition outcomes. Radioimmunoassays were used to analyse total T3 and total T4 in 182 serum samples collected from 172 botos living in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, in the Brazilian Amazon from 2003 through 2015. Age significantly affected tT3 and tT4 concentrations in males, with values in immature males and females being significantly lower than those in adult males, whereas no age effects were noted between immature females and adult non-pregnant, non-lactating females. Significant sex differences were noted in tT3 concentrations between immature males and females and in tT4 concentrations between adult males and females. These resulted in significant differences in the tT3:tT4 ratio between males and females within the immature and adult groups. Lactating and non-pregnant adult females had significantly higher tT3 concentrations than pregnant females, and this difference was primarily driven by a 12% drop in tT3 concentrations during the last two-thirds of pregnancy. No differences in thyroid hormone concentrations were detected between females diagnosed as pregnant and later found to have or not have a live calf. These results are the first to define thyroid hormone reference intervals and normal physiological variations in a wild population of river dolphins. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Tursiops truncatus (Common Bottlenose Dolphin) in Georgia are exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors. Here, we describe a case study of an adult, male Common Bottlenose Dolphin entangled in marine debris, that was temporarily captured, disentangled, sampled for health assessment, satellite tagged, and released. Photographic-identification history and short-term tagging data support that the animal, Z58, has long-term site fidelity to the estuaries of southern Georgia. Health-assessment results identified several abnormal health parameters, including anemia, which likely resulted from exposure to extremely high site-specific contaminants that are known in the area. This note provides a case study of the various stressors to which Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Georgia are exposed, which can be used to develop effective management strategies for at-risk populations. © 2019 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins are some of the most intelligent and amazing mammals on Earth and demonstrating the cognitive abilities of these marine species involves understanding the concept of cognitive convergence, that means the convergence of the processes that involve the manner in which the body is processing the information coming from external and internal environment. In general, cognitive convergence refers to convergence in intelligence and dolphins are endowed with many of those capacities that make them special and worthy of protection beings. Demonstrating the cognitive skills of dolphins bred under human control at Natural Sciences Museum Complex, Constanta and monitoring the set of sophisticated behaviours that this species possesses may represent the premise of adapting these marine mammals as quickly and best possible to new living conditions. In this context, an important role is played by the biology balancing as well as the verification of their ability to adapt to the living conditions, corresponding to their training in order to participate in public demonstrations. Considering that a healthy environment is essential in order to ensure the well-being and performance of dolphins, while also placing a great emphasis on the quality of life of these marine mammals bred under human control at the Natural Sciences Museum Complex Constanta, it is very important to monitor the conditions of the physical, chemical (air temperature, basin water, water pH, residual chlorine, salinity, relative humidity) and microbiological parameters of the water and also the dolphins health. © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic underwater noise has increased over the past century, raising concern about the impact on cetaceans that rely on sound for communication, navigation and locating prey and predators. Many terrestrial animals increase the amplitude of their acoustic signals to partially compensate for the masking effect of noise (the Lombard response), but it has been suggested that cetaceans almost fully compensate with amplitude adjustments for increasing noise levels. Here, we used sound-recording DTAGs on pairs of free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) to test (i) whether dolphins increase signal amplitude to compensate for increasing ambient noise and (ii) whether adjustments are identical for different signal types. We present evidence of a Lombard response in the range 0.1–0.3 dB per 1 dB increase in ambient noise, which is similar to that of terrestrial animals, but much lower than the response reported for other cetaceans. We found that signature whistles tended to be louder and with a lower degree of amplitude adjustment to noise compared with non-signature whistles, suggesting that signature whistles may be selected for higher output levels and may have a smaller scope for amplitude adjustment to noise. The consequence of the limited degree of vocal amplitude compensation is a loss of active space during periods of increased noise, with potential consequences for group cohesion, conspecific encounter rates and mate attraction. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The local Sudak–Novyi Svet (Crimea) population of Black Sea bottlenose dolphins was studied. Observations and acoustic recordings were made throughout 2014 and 2015. This study is the first in Russia to use acoustic identification of individuals based on a “signature whistle” catalog in addition to visual identification. Bottlenose dolphin signatures consisted of tonal signals (whistles) with a frequency contour shape unique for each dolphin. These whistles predominated in the acoustic repertoire of each individual. In this aspect, the signatures can be regarded as acoustic markers of individuals. Analysis of the entire set of dolphin whistle recordings (nearly 30 000 signals) revealed 206 dominant types, i.e., signature whistles. Visual and acoustic data were compared to characterize groups constituting the studied population, to describe the seasonal pattern of visits of different groups to the water area, and to identify transient and resident groups. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Erysipelas is an infection caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae that affects many different species around the world, including cetaceans. The acute septicemic form can rapidly cause death in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus. The ultimate goals of this long-term study were the development and identification of the most effective vaccination protocol against clinical erysipelas in T. truncatus using a commercially available swine vaccine, and to determine whether there is a need for a semi-annual vaccination versus an annual vaccination. The present study concentrated on the immunization of a dolphin population (7 wild-born and 22 captive-born individuals) with 2 swine vaccines, the European ‘Eurovac Ery®’ vaccine and the American ‘ER Bac Plus®’ vaccine, and immunological profile results over a 20-yr time period. The general protocol was a primo-vaccination (between 3 and 7 mo of age for calves) with or without a booster 1 mo post primo-vaccination and either annual or semi-annual vaccination thereafter. Sera were collected prior to vaccination, 2 wk post-vaccination and monthly. A dolphin-specific ELISA was developed to analyze the erysipelas-specific antibody response of vaccinated animals. The final ELISA results (n = 1362 samples from 29 animals at pre- and post-vaccination time) suggest that (1) there is a significant difference in antibody levels at the start of the vaccination between older and younger animals; (2) at least 3 vaccinations are necessary to obtain antibody levels above the levels at pre-vaccination; (3) thereafter, annual vaccinations seem sufficient to keep antibody levels above the levels at pre-vaccination; and (4) both vaccines induced similar responses. No case of erysipelas infection was observed in this population during the study. © Inter-Research 2019

ABSTRACT: Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) are threatened, little-known cetaceans primarily jeopardized by fishing gear entanglement. Information regarding life history, foraging ecology, and movement are crucial to determine management units and conservation regions. This is the first analysis of the ontogenetic changes in diet and habitat of Irrawaddy dolphins from the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea using stable isotopes from skin and teeth. Results suggest limited age and sex structure indicated by weak ontogenetic and sexual variability in δ15N and δ13C in teeth. Significant variation in δ13C and δ15N values were observed between three Gulf regions and the Andaman Sea, indicating distinct regional groups. Isotope mixing models run on soft tissues from the eastern Gulf revealed a diet based primarily on fishes and secondarily on crustaceans, suggesting overlap with fishery targets. Conservation strategies that focus on reducing regional competition with humans and bycatch mortality are proposed. Fishing gear improvements and monitoring of fishing operations are a potential immediate response to reduce anthropogenic impact. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT:                              Substituted diphenylamine antioxidants (SDPAs) and benzotriazole UV stabilizers (BZT-UVs) are additives used in industrial and commercial applications to prevent degradation by oxidation and are contaminants of emerging environmental concern. Little is known about the fate of these contaminants in wildlife, particularly in reptiles, birds and marine mammals. Nine SDPAs and six BZT-UVs were measured in blood plasma of seven fish species, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from various locations in North America. Plasma SDPAs were more frequently (90–100%) detected and with higher concentrations (median: 25–270 pg g                             −1                             , wet weight (ww)) in organisms from urban areas than rural locations (median: <method limits of quantification −136 pg g                             −1                             ). The concentrations of most SDPAs generally followed the order of fish ≥ snapping turtles > double-crested cormorants > bottlenose dolphins. Of the three quantifiable BZT-UVs, 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol (UV328) showed higher detection frequency in most species of fish, bird and turtle (range of 0–67%), indicating the widespread distribution of UV328 in the aquatic environment of lower Great Lakes region.                          © 2018

ABSTRACT: In this study, the Modified Dolphin Monitoring (MDM) operator is used to enhance the performance of some metaheuristic algorithms. The MDM is a recently presented operator that controls the population dispersion in each iteration. Algorithms are selected from some well established algorithms. Here, this operator is applied on Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Vibrating Particles System (VPS), Enhanced Vibrating Particles System (EVPS), Colliding Bodied Optimization (CBO) and Harmony Search (HS) and the performance of these algorithms are evaluated with and without this operator on three wellknown structural optimization problems. The results show the performance of this operator on these algorithms for the best, the worst, average and average weight of the first quarter of answers. © 2019, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

ABSTRACT: Increases in resistance to commonly used antibi- otics have been reported globally in isolates from humans, wildlife, and the environment. To date, few studies have examined long-term trends in antibiotic resistance in organisms isolated from marine mammal populations. The objective of this study was to examine temporal trends in resistance to antibiotics among pathogens isolated from common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) between 2003 and 2015. Dolphins were captured and released in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, an ecosystem with a large coastal human population and significant environmental impacts. Swab samples for microbiology were taken from the blowhole, gastric fluid, and feces and cul- tured on standard media under aerobic conditions. Isolates were identified using gram stain morphol- ogy and growth on selective media. Antibiotic resistance was measured using disc diffusion on Mueller Hinton agar and the Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index calculated for each pathogen. A total of 733 isolates was obtained from 171 individual dolphins. The most com- monly cultured pathogens included Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, and Vibrio alginolyticus. The overall prevalence of resistance to at least one antibiotic for the 733 isolates was 88.2%. The MAR index increased significantly between 2003 and 2007 and 2010 and 2015 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and alginolyticus. For all bacterial isolates, resis- tance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin increased significantly between sampling periods. This is one of few studies to use the MAR index for bacterial isolates from a marine mammal. The significant increases in resistance for some bac-terial species likely reflect shared environmental exposures to antibiotics and transfer of resistance to dolphins from terrestrial sources or from animal or human populations. © 2019, European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Odontocetes (toothed whales) have amongst the most radically altered skull of any mammal, but no study has tested how these modifications have altered its phenotypic integration. Here, we perform the first rigorous assessment of modularity in Delphinus delphis, using a combination of cluster analysis, covariance ratio tests and maximum-likelihood methods, on 27 landmarked skulls. Cluster analysis identified ten semi-autonomous regions (modules), five consisting of bilaterally paired landmarks, while the remaining landmarks were distributed among modules representing the face, zygomatic, nasals, pterygoids and vault. The novel ten-module hypothesis, as well as a simplified version consisting of only the five major modules, was then compared with existing hypotheses formulated for terrestrial mammals based on developmental origin and/or function. We found our novel hypotheses to perform best, except when cranial asymmetry was removed. With the loss of asymmetry, a six-module hypothesis developed for terrestrial mammals was found to best fit the data. Anatomical changes in the skull related to the evolution of echolocation, as well as loss of mastication, best explain the novel modules identified in this study. Our study also provides strong evidence that the evolution of cranial asymmetry is a substantial driver of changes in modularity within whales. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: In comparison with terrestrial animals, such as primates, there is limited empirical evidence for cooperative behavior in marine mammals under experimental conditions. In this study, we used a cooperative rope-pulling task to investigate how bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) coordinate their behavior with a partner. Dolphins successfully learned and were able to perform the task, even when one subject started after the other. In the no-delay condition (i.e., both subjects sent at the same time), one pair of dolphins showed coordinated behaviors. When pairs were successful in solving the task in the delay condition (i.e., one individual sent later than the other), the initiators (i.e., first individual sent) were likely to wait for the follower to arrive, and the follower was likely to swim faster when the initiator did not wait and started pulling the rope alone. These coordinated behaviors might help resolve the given cooperative task. Our results suggest that bottlenose dolphins learn to coordinate their behaviors via trial and error and recognize the necessity of performing simultaneous actions with a partner to successfully accomplish cooperative tasks. In addition, both partners showed behavioral changes over many trials of no-delay and delay conditions, suggesting that bidirectional coordination occurred in the cooperative task.

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary mycosis is a fungal disease that commonly affects bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and is generally treated by the oral administration of azoles, such as itraconazole (ITZ) and voriconazole (VRZ). However, antifungal susceptibility testing of clinical isolates has not been well performed as a routine clinical examination in aquaria. In this study, we collected fungal species from the blowholes of 14 bottlenose dolphins, of which 12 were treated with ITZ or VRZ. All dolphins were housed in the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium. The fungal species Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus, and A. niger were isolated. E-tests were performed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ITZ and VRZ on these isolates. VRZ-resistant C. tropicalis (MIC: >32 µg/ml) and A. niger (MIC: >32 µg/ml) were isolated from three dolphins treated with ITZ or VRZ. Additionally, azole-resistant isolates of C. albicans and C. glabrata were collected from two dolphins that had never received azole therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report the isolation of VRZ-resistant C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and A. niger from the blowholes of bottlenose dolphins. Thus, antifungal susceptibility testing is a crucial strategy for selecting antifungal agents to treat respiratory fungal infections in bottlenose dolphins in aquaria. © 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: This study reports gross, histopathological, and molecular features of a Chlamydia abortus infection in a stranded female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba from the Tyrrhenian coast of southern Italy. Post-mortem examination revealed liver congestion, splenic lymphoid depletion with capsular petechiae, and pneumonia. Histology revealed disseminated intravascular coagulation with vasculitis and congestion. Hepatocellular and acute myocardial degeneration were also observed. Basophilic, coccobacillary inclusions consistent with Chlamydia spp. were observed histologically in the type II pneumocytes, myocardial fibers, and hepatocytes, and in macrophages and plasma cells of liver, spleen, and prescapular lymph nodes. Chlamydial antigen was detected by immunofluorescence assay using genus-specific anti-Chlamydia antibodies. PCR assay revealed C. abortus in spleen, liver, heart, and lungs. C. abortus was the only pathogen detected. The main pathological changes suggest that Chlamydia infection may have been the cause of stranding and death of the striped dolphin. This case represents the first molecular detection of a member of the Chlamydiaceae in a marine mammal. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: Considerable efforts have been made to better understand the immune system of bottlenose dolphins in view of the common environmental challenges they encounter, such as exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, oil spills, or harmful algal bloom biotoxins. However, little is known about the identity and functionality of the Th1, Th2, and Treg T helper cell subsets in bottlenose dolphins. The present study aimed at validating assays and reagents to identify T helper cell subsets and their functions in a subset of dolphins from Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA, which have been long studied and often used as a reference population. A population of CD4+ FOXP3+ lymphocytes was identified representing an average <1% of blood lymphocyte population, which is in the range observed in for Treg cells in other species. The use of porcine reagents to measure TGFß, one of the key Treg cytokines, was further validated using the relatively high-throughput and highly standardized Luminex technology. The proportion of circulating Treg cells was not correlated with the serum concentrations of the Treg effector cytokines TGFß and IL-10, nor could it significantly contribute to predicting the variability of T lymphocyte proliferation, suggesting that not all dolphin circulating Treg cells are functional and active. However, stimulation of dolphin lymphocytes with TGFß and IL-2 increased the expression of the gene for TGFß and IL-10, and stimulation with IL-12 and IFNγ induced a robust increase in the expression of the gene for IFNγ, suggesting the potential for polarization and differentiation of dolphin T helper cells toward a Treg and Th1 response, respectively. The lack of an increase in the expression of the genes for the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 upon stimulation with IL-4 may be due to the requirement for IL-2 for a Th2 polarization as described in mice. However, regression analysis and PCA suggested the potential ability of both the Th1 and Th2 response to be triggered upon acute inflammatory signals. These results may be useful in better understanding the mechanisms by which the dolphin immune system is affected upon exposure to environmental challenges and how it responds to pathogen challenges. © 2019 De Guise, Levin, Jasperse, Risatti and Wells.

ABSTRACT: The study addresses the question of the possible design benefits when considering the interaction between a modern marine modular rubber fender and a steel tubular pile substructure of a berthing dolphin. Absorption of the berthing kinetic energy of the vessel by a dual-elasticity pile-fender berthing system is described in detail using the interactive treatment method (ITM). Application of the ITM is illustrated by a calculative example, assuming a 37,700 deadweight ton (DWT) tanker as a berthing ship, realistic geometries of large-diameter steel piles of the berthing dolphin substructure, and a family of Sumitomo π(Pi)-type modular rubber fender units. By splitting the berthing kinetic energy into two parts absorbed by two elastic component elements of the dual-elasticity system of the berthing dolphin, the ITM is an effective tool for proper selection of the minimum required size (i.e., outside diameter and wall thickness) of steel piles of the berthing dolphin substructure in relation to the size of fender unit assumed. Finally, using ITM, an example analysis is performed to illustrate the influence of fender size selection on the berthing force, and the mass and stiffness of the steel-pile substructure of the berthing dolphin, as meaningful parameters influencing the most economical solution in the berthing dolphin design. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

ABSTRACT: Bangladesh is host to a major cetacean habitat. The country declared its first marine protected area, namely, the Swatch-of-No-Ground Marine Protected Area, for conservation of some species of dolphins, porpoises, whales and sharks. However, this declaration has not been supported with an effective and robust legal, policy and institutional framework. Against this backdrop, this article critically examines the existing legal and institutional framework for management of this marine protected area. A study on the existing legal framework shows the absence of a robust national legal system for prevention of marine pollution and protection of marine biodiversity. This lack of national legal framework will have a significant impact on the future success of the Marine Protected Area. Moreover, an analysis of the relevant national institutions shows that they are not fully capable of enforcing the law and policy in the marine protected area. Through this analysis, this paper proposes that preparation of a management plan, provision of adequate resources to the relevant agencies, ensuring interagency cooperation, engagement of stakeholders and implementation of international marine environmental law are crucial for the future success of this marine protected area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In order to increase the surfacing dolphin's detection probability by the balloon camera system similar to that of a human observer, improvements were made in the camera system on the balloon [1]. Followed by test on ground, fusion census of both acoustic and visual census with the improved camera system on the balloon was conducted at the same experiment site as 2016 for three days from 6 to 8 February, 2018. The performance of the improved balloon camera system for supporting the fusion census was well demonstrated, even though the balloon census could be conducted only when the wind direction was aligned with the boat cruise direction. The improved system could cover previous system drawbacks and could also capture the individual dolphin's features such as migration behavior of the dolphin with a calf, measurement of body length of the small calf, etc. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Oral pathological conditions are common in mammals and have been relatively well documented for some wild groups, but are rarely reported in marine mammals. Here, we report for the Mexican Caribbean the first case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a free-ranging dolphin. A bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus adult male (256.5 cm total length) was found stranded dead in the west coast of the State Reserve "Chetumal Bay Manatee Sanctuary". Herein, we discuss some plausible explanations about the origin of this lesion to improve the knowledge about the species biology. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The retia mirabilia are vascular nets composed of small vessels dispersed among numerous veins, allowing blood storage, regulation of flow and pressure damping effects. Here, we investigated their potential role during the diving phase of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). To this effect, the whole vertebral retia mirabilia of a series of dolphins were removed during post-mortem analysis and examined to assess vessel diameters, and estimate vascular volume and flow rate. We formulated a new hemodynamic model to help clarify vascular dynamics throughout the diving phase, based on the total blood volume of a bottlenose dolphin, and using data available about the perfusion of the main organs and body systems. We computed the minimum blood perfusion necessary to the internal organs, and the stroke volume and cardiac output during the surface state. We then simulated breath-holding conditions and perfusion of the internal organs under the diving-induced bradycardia and reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output, using 10 beats min−1 as the limit for the heart rate for an extended dive of over 3 min. Within these simulated conditions, the retia mirabilia play a vital role as reservoirs of oxygenated blood that permit functional performances and survival of the heart and brain. Our theoretical model, based on the actual blood capacity of the retia mirabilia and available data on organ perfusion, considers the dynamic trend of vasoconstriction during the diving phase and may represent a baseline for future studies on the diving physiology of dolphins and especially for the blood supply to their brain. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: Four groups of toothed whales have independently evolved to produce narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation signals (i.e. clicks) with a strikingly similar waveform and centroid frequency around 125 kHz. These signals are thought to help NBHF species avoid predation by echolocating and communicating at frequencies inaudible to predators, a form of acoustic crypsis. Heaviside's dolphins produce NBHF echolocation clicks in trains and often in rapid succession in the form of buzzes. In addition, a second click type with a lower frequency and broader bandwidth was recently described, typically emitted in rapid succession in the form of burst-pulses. We investigated the relationship between buzz and burst-pulse signals and both surface behaviour (foraging, ‘interacting with the kayak’ and socializing) and group size, using a multivariable regression on the signal occurrence and signal count data. Signal occurrence and counts were not related to group size in the regression analysis. Burst-pulses were strongly linked to socializing behaviour, occurring more often and more frequently during socializing and much less during foraging. Buzz vocalizations were not strongly linked to a specific behaviour although there was some evidence of an increase in production during foraging and socializing. In addition, individual level production rates of buzzes during foraging and socializing, and burst-pulses during socializing decreased with increasing group size. Temporally patterned burst-pulse signals were also identified, often occurring within a series of burst-pulses and were directly linked to specific events such as aerial leaping, backflipping, tail slapping and potential mating. Our findings suggest Heaviside's dolphins have a more complex communication system based on pulsed vocalizations than previously understood, perhaps driven by the need to facilitate the social interactions of this species. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: This study used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 in the identification of the fish prey from the gut samples collected from a stranding of a dead Irrawaddy dolphin in Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. Obtained consensus sequences were searched against the nucleotide database of NCBI and reference sequences, and sample sequences were used for generating the dendrogram and the pairwise genetic distances between species. Results showed that most of the sample sequences were 99% identical to the reference sequences. Eubleekeria splendens and Conger japonicus were the identified species in the stomach contents. E. splendens is a demersal and coastal species while C. japonicus is a demersal species and has not been previously recorded in the Philippines. Conflict in the taxonomy of the Conger genus may suggest that this may be identified as C. jordani. This study reports the first record of fish prey identification of the Irrawaddy dolphin in the country. Continuous monitoring of the Irrawaddy dolphin in the Guimaras Strait, including their feeding ecology, is needed to understand the population further and to improve their conservation. © Philippine Journal of Fisheries.

ABSTRACT: This study was carried out to investigate the effects of replacing fish meal with dietary Spirulina as a feed supplement on the growth performance and coloration of blue dolphin cichlids (Cyrtocara moorii). Five isonitrogenous (47% crude protein) and isocaloric (17.36 kJ/g digestible energy) diets were for formulated to replace FM with 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% Spirulina (designated as Control, SP5, SP10, SP15 and SP20 respectively) and fed to the fish (initial body weight, 3.15 ± 0.01 g). Fish were randomly distributed into fifteen 120 L aquariums (26.5 ± 1.00°C), 15 fish per aquarium. The diets were tested in triplicate for 12 weeks. Experimental groups were fed twice daily (09:00 and 17:00) by hand to satiation. At the end of the feeding trial, significantly (p < 0.05) higher weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) were observed in fish fed the SP10 diet when compared to the SP20 diet. There was no significant difference in these parameters between the other groups. The skin coloration of blue dolphin cichlid fed a diet containing Spirulina meal was enhanced. The best coloration was observed in the SP15 group. These impressions were objectively validated by chemical determinations of carotenoids extracted from fish skins and passed statistical tests of significance. The study findings show that Spirulina meal does not diminish growth rates except at very high levels. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Over the span of several years, 3 Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins died and were necropsied in Thailand. These 3 animals were all captive-bred at Oasis Sea World (Chanthaburi, Thailand), and displayed similar macroscopic progressive cutaneous lesions diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas. In 2 of the 3 animals, necropsy revealed a severe fibrinosuppurative tracheitis and pneumonia secondary to metastasis of a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma which extended from the head throughout the trunk and flippers. The tumors were characterized by coalescing botryoid masses with severe areas of cutaneous erosion, ulceration and necrohemorrhagic dermatitis. There was evidence of metastasis to the lungs and hilar lymph nodes. Necropsy of the third animal revealed similar progressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas but without evidence of metastasis. DNA molecular analysis of homogenized neoplastic tissue was conducted using polymerase chain reaction for both herpesvirus and papillomavirus in 2 of the 3 cases. In the first case, the tissues were positive for a herpesvirus alone, and this was phylogenetically classified as an alphaherpesvirus. This new herpesvirus has been tentatively named Sousa chinensis alphaherpesvirus. The second animal was negative for this novel herpesvirus and the third was not analyzed. In addition to the captive population, there is photographic evidence from 2 separate wild populations of Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins in the Gulf of Thailand, of a macroscopically identical proliferative and ulcerative process suspected to be squamous cell carcinomas. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: The early Miocene of Patagonia (Argentina) provides one of the best-known records of odontocetes for an age interval with scarce fossils. Most of these taxa are historically old and briefly described, which has contributed, in part, to their controversial taxonomic position. The shark-toothed dolphin Phoberodon arctirostris was described almost 100 years ago and suggested as a member of Platanistoidea and Squalodontidae. However, it has not been analysed recently and has never been included in a phylogenetic analysis. Recent fieldwork in the early Miocene sediments in Patagonia yielded a new specimen referred to this species, allowing for its modern and detailed description and the first phylogenetic analyses. Analyses recovered P. arctirostris as a stem Odontoceti or an early-diverging platanistoid, more closely related to an unnamed Oligocene specimen from New Zealand and not in a clade with Squalodon calvertensis (i.e. Squalodontidae). The reconstructed body length of P. arctirostris indicates that it is one of the largest stem Odontoceti. Our results suggest that during the early Miocene of Patagonia, archaic odontocete forms (i.e. P. arctirostris) cohabited with archaic and more crownward platanistoids (i.e. Aondelphis talen and Notocetus vanbenedeni), helping to characterize the early Miocene cetacean communities of Patagonia. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London

ABSTRACT: Blubber and respiratory vapour (‘blow’) are now commonly used for endocrine studies on cetaceans, primarily because they can be obtained using minimally invasive methods. For many species, these samples have yet to be validated for these purposes. The objective of this study was to examine the performance of blow and blubber hormone monitoring, relative to serum hormone monitoring, for evaluating the reproductive and adrenal condition of captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.). Eighteen bottlenose dolphins were sampled five times for serum and blow and twice for blubber throughout a one-year period. Concentrations of progesterone, testosterone, oestradiol and cortisol were measured in each sample type. Hormone levels were examined in relation to dolphin age, sex, reproductive status, season, time of sample collection (morning/afternoon) and collection type (in- or out-of-water sampling). Patterns in hormone levels were similar for serum and blubber. For instance, in both sample types, progesterone levels were significantly higher in pregnant (serum: 34.10 ± 8.64 ng/mL; blubber: 13.01 ± 0.72 ng/g) than in non-pregnant females (serum: 0.32 ± 0.09 ng/mL; blubber: 1.17 ± 0.10 ng/g). This pattern was not detected in blow, primarily because seawater contamination, nylon sampling materials and variable sample volumes influenced measured concentrations. In addition, the respiratory water content of a blow sample is known to affect measured hormone levels. Two methods were trialled to control for variability in sample volumes and dilution: (1) normalising blow hormone concentrations relative to urea nitrogen levels (a potential endogenous standard), and (2) measuring the relative proportions (i.e. ratios) of blow hormones. These correction measures had little influence on blow hormone results. Further refinement of blow hormone monitoring methods is required before they can be used for reproductive or adrenal assessments of bottlenose dolphins. Blubber, on the other hand, should be a suitable proxy for serum when attempting to classify pregnancy status and male maturity in these species. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Individuals often associate socially with those who behave the same way. This principle, homophily, could structure populations into distinct social groups. We tested this hypothesis in a bottlenose dolphin population that appeared to be clustered around a specialized foraging tactic involving cooperation with net-casting fishermen, but in which other potential drivers of such social structure have never been assessed. We measured and controlled for the contribution of sex, age, genetic relatedness, home range and foraging tactics on social associations to test for homophily effects. Dolphins tended to group with others having similar home ranges and frequency of using the specialized foraging tactic, but not other traits. Such social preferences were particularly clear when dolphins were not foraging, showing that homophily extends beyond simply participating in a specific tactic. Combined, these findings highlight the need to account for multiple drivers of group formation across behavioural contexts to determine true social affiliations. We suggest that homophily around behavioural specialization can be a major driver of social patterns, with implications for other social processes. If homophily based on specialized tactics underlies animal social structures more widely, then it may be important in modulating opportunities for social learning, and therefore influence patterns of cultural transmission. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin Tower is a 15-story high rise residential building in downtown Sarasota, Florida. It was constructed in early 1970s. Precast 14″×14″ reinforced concrete piles were used as deep foundation. Dolphin Tower experienced punching shear failures in the reinforced concrete slabs of several floors. While the punching shear failures were not related to any foundation deficiencies, as part of the evaluations and design for retrofitting and repairing the structure, it was required by law to assess the structure for compliance with the Florida building code in effect at the time of the repairs. After assessing the loads, it became evident the loads on deep foundations, as per current Florida building code, were larger than the design loads. There were no pile installation or certificate of construction completion records available. A site characterization program consisting of SPT borings and CPT soundings were carried out to characterize the subsurface geological material. Compressive, tensile, and lateral capacity of existing piles were evaluated using up-to-date field data and empirical pile capacity analysis methods. In addition, as part of bringing the building into compliance with the current Florida building code, existing shear walls were enhanced and additional shear walls were proposed. Considering the limitations imposed for installing new deep foundations under an existing building, helical piles were used as the foundation for the new shear walls and where needed for enhancing the existing foundation system. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

ABSTRACT: The recent discovery of the Araguaian river dolphin (Inia araguaiaensis) highlights how little we know about the diversity and biology of river dolphins. In this study, we described the acoustic repertoire of this newly discovered species in concert with their behaviour. We analysed frequency contours of 727 signals (sampled at 10 ms temporal resolution). These contours were analyzed using an adaptive resonance theory neural network combined with dynamic time-warping (ARTwarp). Using a critical similarity value of 96%, frequency contours were categorized into 237 sound-types. The most common types were emitted when calves were present suggesting a key role in mother-calf communication. Our findings show that the acoustic repertoire of river dolphins is far from simple. Furthermore, the calls described here are similar in acoustic structure to those produced by social delphinids, such as orcas and pilot whales. Uncovering the context in which these signals are produced may help understand the social structure of this species and contribute to our understanding of the evolution of acoustic communication in whales. © Copyright 2019 Melo-Santos et al.

ABSTRACT: Dietary and urinary risk factors have been implicated in conditions favoring ammonium urate nephrolithiasis in managed dolphins compared with free-ranging dolphins. In this study, urine samples were collected from 16 dolphins (8 cases, 8 controls) from the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program for the purposes of assessing changes in urinary biomarkers after a large meal. Urinary biomarkers and nephrolithiasis presence were assessed opportunistically in 15 long-term resident free-ranging dolphins living in Sarasota Bay, Florida. Additionally, the total purine contents of fish commonly consumed by each dolphin population were measured to evaluate potential dietary risk factors. Populations were compared for total dietary purine composition, recently fed status, nephrolithiasis presence, and differences in urinary biochemical, acid-base, and physicochemical parameters via Wilcoxon rank sum analysis and least square means. Managed dolphins had higher urinary pH and ammonium (NH+4) in both pre- and postprandial conditions and higher urinary uric acid and saturation indices of NH4U in the postprandial condition compared with free-ranging dolphins (P < 0.05). The purine content was greater (P < 0.0001) in the diet consumed by managed dolphins [7 mmol/Mcal metabolizable energy (ME)] than in the free-ranging dolphin diet (4 mmol/Mcal ME). Free-ranging dolphins did not show evidence of nephrolithiasis. Observed differences in urinary biomarkers and dietary purine content in these two dolphin populations suggest a pathophysiologic basis for the role of fish types on the risk of NH4U stone formation. Future research should investigate fish type and feeding frequency, inhibitors and promoters, and alkalinizing therapy for reducing NH4U nephrolithiasis in dolphins. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: The presence of epizoic diatoms on the skin of a variety of large marine vertebrates, such as whales and dolphins, has been often reported in the scientific literature. The first observations of an algal growth over on the skin of cetaceans were probably made around 1920. Later studies showed the presence of a new species, Cocconeis ceticola, on skin samples. Morphological features of this species led to the transference of C. ceticola, together with related forms, to the new genus Bennettella Holmes. Here, we report the occurrence of a diatom film of Bennettella ceticola on the skin of the Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), obtained from bycatch in fishermen’s gillnets at Samborombon Bay, Argentina, in April 2005. For comparison the holotype of B. ceticola, deposited in the Natural History Museum (London, U.K.) dated 1920 and labelled as Cocconeis ceticola was examined. Detailed analysis of the fine structure of B. ceticola shows that it mostly matches the original description. However, the external raphe ending is not bifurcated (as originally described), and has only one simple, parallel sided slit and polar fissures hidden by a triangular flange. The triangular flange is the main diagnostic feature distinguishing Bennettella from Epipellis Holmes and Cocconeis Ehrenberg, allowing us to propose an emended description of Bennettella. The taxonomic affinities of B. ceticola with related genera, such as Cocconeis and Epipellis, are discussed. The present study constitutes the first report of B. ceticola as an epizoic diatom of a cetacean species in waters of the Argentinean Sea. © 2019, © 2019 The International Society for Diatom Research.

ABSTRACT: -Dusky dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus is distributed primarily in cool coastal waters at several continental margins and island borders in the Southern Hemisphere. Off Peru, the northernmost record of this species has been in front of the coast of Salaverry (ca., 6°S). In this paper, we report for the first-time a pod of dusky dolphin at the coast of Los Órganos (4°9.517’S; 81°11.958’W) northern Peru, thus extending the potential distributional range ca., 350 km towards the equator. A group of between 10 to 20 adult individuals was sighted on 17 October 2017, during a whale-watching excursion. Digital photographs and film allowed us to confirm the species based on body morphology and coloration. The sighted group was moving around the area without heading to a given direction. This record constitutes the northernmost record of dusky dolphin in Peru and arguably in the Southern Hemisphere. © 2018, Universidad de Valparaiso. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In recent decades, a number of studies have examined whether various non-human animals understand their partner's role in cooperative situations. Yet the relatively tolerant timing requirements of these tasks make it theoretically possible for animals to succeed by using simple behavioural strategies rather than by jointly intended coordination. Here we investigated whether bottlenose dolphins could understand a cooperative partner's role by testing whether they could learn a button-pressing task requiring precise behavioural synchronization. Specifically, members of cooperative dyads were required to swim across a lagoon and each press their own underwater button simultaneously (within a 1 s time window), whether sent together or with a delay between partners of 1-20 s. We found that dolphins were able to work together with extreme precision even when they had to wait for their partner, and that their coordination improved over the course of the study, with the time between button presses in the latter trials averaging 370 ms. These findings show that bottlenose dolphins can learn to understand their partner's role in a cooperative situation, and suggest that the behavioural synchronization evident in wild dolphins' synchronous movement and coordinated alliance displays may be a generalized cognitive ability that can also be used to solve novel cooperative tasks. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The upper Neogene Pisco Formation of Peru is known worldwide as one of the most significant Cenozoic marine vertebrate Konservatt-Lagerstätten, even featuring cetacean specimens that retain remains of soft tissues or stomach contents. Previous works showed that biomediated precipitation of dolomite concretions around large-sized decaying carcasses was one of the most relevant processes responsible for exceptional fossil preservation. In turn, little is known about the modes of fossilization of well-preserved small-sized vertebrates, which are rather common in the Pisco Formation, but mostly do not exhibit dolomite concretions. We report on a cetacean specimen, identified as belonging to the extinct short-snouted, small dolphin species Brachydelphis mazeasi (Pontoporiidae), preserved within a late Miocene sandy deposit at the site of Pampa Corre Viento. This specimen consists of a moderately disarticulated partial skeleton exhibiting well-mineralized bones; it is not enclosed within a dolomite concretion, being however delimited by an evident dark boundary in the host sediment. Scanning electron microscopy and microanalytical investigations identify Mn-oxides and apatite as early diagenetic minerals around the skeleton. We argue that a rapid burial of the specimen was pivotal for the preservation of the bones, and allowed the early establishment of anoxic processes for degradation of organic matter. Coupled with availability of P in porewater, the reducing conditions and the lowered pH allowed precipitation of Ca-phosphate while increasing Mn solubility close to the pontoporiid carcass. Mn-oxides precipitated at the redox boundary, the latter defining the outer edge of the volume of sediment affected by altered chemical conditions due to the decaying processes. The permeability of the sediment and the small size of the carcass were possible factors unfavorable to extensive sulfate reduction, thus preventing the formation of a dolomite concretion and allowing bone phosphatization. This record emphasizes the role of conditions favorable to bone mineralization in absence of an isolating carbonate concretion, in cases of high quality preservation of small-sized vertebrates observed in the Pisco Formation. The observation of patterns in the distribution of diagenetic minerals in the sediment enclosing vertebrate remains without, or with limited carbonate concretions provides insights into early taphonomic processes. © 2018, Servicio Nacional de Geologia y Mineria.

ABSTRACT: Ocean noise varies spatially and temporally and is driven by natural and anthropogenic processes. Increased ambient noise levels can cause signal masking and communication impairment, affecting fitness and recruitment success. However, the effects of increasing ambient noise levels on marine species, such as marine mammals that primarily rely on sound for communication, are not well understood. We investigated the effects of concurrent ambient noise levels on social whistle calls produced by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the western North Atlantic. Elevated ambient noise levels were mainly caused by ship noise. Increases in ship noise, both within and below the dolphins' call bandwidth, resulted in higher dolphin whistle frequencies and a reduction in whistle contour complexity, an acoustic feature associated with individual identification. Consequently, the noise-induced simplification of dolphin whistles may reduce the information content in these acoustic signals and decrease effective communication, parent-offspring proximity or group cohesion. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: In the last 20years, Cetacean Morbillivirus (CeMV) has been responsible for many die-offs in marine mammals worldwide, as clearly exemplified by the three dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) epizootics of 1990-1992, 2006-2008 and 2011 that affected Mediterranean striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). Systemic infection caused by DMV in the Mediterranean has been reported only during these outbreaks. Results: We report the infection of five striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded on the Spanish Mediterranean coast of Valencia after the last DMV outbreak that ended in 2011. Animal 1 stranded in late 2011 and Animal 2 in 2012. Systemic infection affecting all tissues was found based on histopathology and positive immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction positive results. Animal 3 stranded in 2014; molecular and immunohistochemical detection was positive only in the central nervous system. Animals 4 and 5 stranded in 2015, and DMV antigen was found in several tissues. Partial sequences of the DMV phosphoprotein (P), nucleoprotein (N), and hemagglutinin (H) genes were identical for Animals 2, 3, 4, and 5, and were remarkably different from those in Animal 1. The P sequence from Animal 1 was identical to that of the DMV strain that caused the epizootic of 2011 in the Spanish Mediterranean. The corresponding sequence from Animals 2-5 was identical to that from a striped dolphin stranded in 2011 on the Canary Islands and to six dolphins stranded in northeastern Atlantic of the Iberian Peninsula. Conclusions: These results suggest the existence of an endemic infection cycle among striped dolphins in the Mediterranean that may lead to occasional systemic disease presentations outside epizootic periods. This cycle involves multiple pathogenic viral strains, one of which may have originated in the Atlantic Ocean. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sharks are apex predators that influence the behavioural ecology of a range of prey species. Unsuccessful predation attempts from sharks are evidenced by fresh bites and scars, and these wounds provide indirect measures of predation pressure. To better understand the predatory dynamics of sharks on bottlenose dolphins, we investigated the frequency, sex and age class differences, seasonality and annual trends, and location (open vs. sheltered waters) of shark predation attempts on Tursiops aduncus off Bunbury, south-western Australia. Over seven years from 2007 to 2013, standardised boat-based, photographic-identification dolphin surveys (n = 600) were conducted year-round over 540 km2 in open coastal and sheltered waters (bay, estuary and river). The overall frequency of shark predation attempts on dolphins (calves, juveniles and adults) was 16.9% (58 of 343). Shark bites were categorised as Open (n = 25, 40.9%), Intermediate (n = 16, 26.2%) and Scars (n = 20, 32.8%). Scarring frequencies did not differ significantly between sexes or among age classes. Bites increased in frequency from 2009 to 2013, coinciding with sustained warm water temperatures from 2011 La Niña conditions, resulting in 34% of Open and Intermediate bites being recorded in 2013. The frequency of Open bites differed among seasons, with bites more prevalent during the summer of 2012/13. The proportion of dolphins with shark bites was significantly greater for individuals residing in the sheltered waters (24.7%, 19 of 77) compared to open waters (13.4%, 34 of 253). Our findings provide knowledge into predator-prey dynamics of marine top predators by quantifying temporal and spatial incidences of failed predation attempts of sharks on bottlenose dolphins in temperate, south-west Australia. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This study assessed the interest toward novel video clips as enrichment stimuli in two species of captive dolphins (Tursiops: n = 11; Steno: n = 5). Videos were played at underwater viewing windows while the animals were housed with conspecifics, and responses were subsequently analyzed based on general content of each novel video. Interest levels (i.e., percentage of time watching and behavioral rate) were compared between species and within species across video categories. While the varied video contexts did not produce significant differences among the time spent watching or behaviors observed, species differences and sex differences were noted. Rough-toothed dolphins displayed significantly more behaviors, particularly interest and bubble behaviors, than bottlenose dolphins, with no differences observed between the species for the percentage of time spent watching. Among bottlenose dolphins, males watched the television longer, and responded behaviorally significantly more, displaying a higher rate of bubble and aggressive behaviors than females. Male rough-toothed dolphins displayed significantly more aggressive behaviors than females, with no other sex differences noted. Overall, these data suggest that television may serve as a useful enrichment device for certain individuals and species of cetaceans, as well as a cognitive experimental tool, as long as sex, species, and individual differences are taken into consideration when interpreting results. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) use complex acoustic behaviours for communication, group cohesion and foraging. Ambient noise from natural and anthropogenic sources has implications for the acoustic behaviour of dolphins, and research shows that average ambient noise levels alter dolphin acoustic behaviour. However, when background noise levels are highly variable, the relationships between noise and acoustic behaviour over short time periods are likely important. This study investigates whether bottlenose dolphins altered the temporal and spectral qualities of their whistles in relation to the ambient noise present at the time the whistles were produced. Dolphin groups were recorded in Tampa Bay (western Florida) between 2008 and 2015. Six whistle parameters were analysed in spectrogram software (minimum frequency, maximum frequency, bandwidth, peak frequency, duration and number of inflection points) and ambient noise levels were calculated immediately prior to each whistle. Linear regression analysis indicated that the minimum, maximum and peak frequencies of whistles had significant positive relationships with the ambient noise levels present at the time of the whistles. These models suggested that for each 1 dB increase in ambient noise, minimum frequency increased by 121 Hz, maximum frequency increased by 108 Hz and peak frequency increased by between 122 and 144 Hz. As ambient noise is typically low frequency, this suggests that bottlenose dolphins increased whistle frequency in response to real-time noise levels to avoid masking. Future research to determine the fitness consequences of noise-induced changes in the communication behaviour of dolphins would be an important contribution to conservation efforts. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are powerful tools for research and monitoring of wildlife. However, the effects of these systems on most marine mammals are largely unknown, preventing the establishment of guidelines that will minimize animal disturbance. In this study, we evaluated the behavioral responses of coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) to small multi-rotor UAS flight. From 2015 to 2017, we piloted 211 flights using DJI quadcopters (Phantom II Vision +, 3 Professional and 4) to approach and follow animals over shallow-water habitats in Belize. The quadcopters were equipped with high-resolution cameras to observe dolphins during 138 of these flights, and manatees during 73 flights. Aerial video observations of animal behavior were coded and paired with flight data to determine whether animal activity and/or the UAS's flight patterns caused behavioral changes in exposed animals. Dolphins responded to UAS flight at altitudes of 11-30 m and responded primarily when they were alone or in small groups. Single dolphins and one pair responded to the UAS by orienting upward and turning toward the aircraft to observe it, before quickly returning to their pre-response activity. A higher number of manatees responded to the UAS, exhibiting strong disturbance in response to the aircraft from 6 to 104 m. Manatees changed their behavior by fleeing the area and sometimes this elicited the same response in nearby animals. If pursued post-response, manatees repeatedly responded to overhead flight by evading the aircraft's path. These findings suggest that the invasiveness of UAS varies across individuals, species, and taxa. We conclude that careful exploratory research is needed to determine the impact of multi-rotor UAS flight on diverse species, and to develop best practices aimed at reducing the disturbance to wildlife that may result from their use. © 2018 Ramos, Maloney, Magnasco and Reiss.

ABSTRACT: The functioning of marine protected areas (MPAs) designated for marine megafauna has been criticized due to the high mobility and dispersal potential of these taxa. However, dispersal within a network of small MPAs can be beneficial as connectivity can result in increased effective population size, maintain genetic diversity, and increase robustness to ecological and environmental changes making populations less susceptible to stochastic genetic and demographic effects (i.e., Allee effect). Here, we use both genetic and photo-identification methods to quantify gene flow and demographic dispersal between MPAs of a highly mobile marine mammal, the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus. We identify three populations in the waters of western Ireland, two of which have largely nonoverlapping core coastal home ranges and are each strongly spatially associated with specific MPAs. We find high site fidelity of individuals within each of these two coastal populations to their respective MPA. We also find low levels of demographic dispersal between the populations, but it remains unclear whether any new gametes are exchanged between populations through these migrants (genetic dispersal). The population sampled in the Shannon Estuary has a low estimated effective population size and appears to be genetically isolated. The second coastal population, sampled outside of the Shannon, may be demographically and genetically connected to other coastal subpopulations around the coastal waters of the UK. We therefore recommend that the methods applied here should be used on a broader geographically sampled dataset to better assess this connectivity. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The distribution and habitat use of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus along the south coast of South Africa was investigated using bi-monthly boat-based surveys, from 2013 to 2016, over a distance of 145 km between the Goukamma and Tsitsikamma marine protected areas (MPAs). Survey effort totalled 6 239 km and 750.6 hours. Encounters occurred throughout the area (n = 200) and more frequently during winter. Pod sizes ranged from 1 to 350 animals (mean = 45), with calves mostly associated with larger groups. During 70% of the encounters, at least a single calf was present (up to 80 calves; mean = 5) and calves were more prevalent during summer. Encounters occurred mostly in shallower (mean = 11.3 m) and warmer (mean = 17.4 °C) waters. Groups aggregated in larger sizes in colder waters. Most encounters were in Plettenberg Bay and the Goukamma MPA, both of which are characterised by sandy bottoms and sheltered areas. Encounter rates were lowest in rocky and exposed areas, but dolphin groups in such locations were larger and usually travelling. There was a relatively low association of T. aduncus groups with MPAs, except for a sandy area in the Goukamma MPA in particular, suggesting some mismatch between favourable T. aduncus habitat and habitat protection. © 2018, © 2018 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Information on movement patterns and habitat selection for critical activities are fundamental to understanding and managing animal populations. While bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, are known to exhibit long-term residency, data regarding short-term movement and association patterns, habitat use, and activity budgets are limited. These parameters and the percentage of time dolphins occurred within a predetermined survey strip were evaluated utilizing VHF radio-telemetry. A total of nine IRL dolphins (eight males and one female) were captured and fitted with radio transmitters (summers of 2007 and 2010). Focal follows utilized instantaneous scan samples and standardized behavioral categories. Conspecifics were identified, and the half-weight index was utilized to evaluate association patterns. Radio tags remained adhered for 15 to 97 days (mean: 45.8 ± 25.3 days), and the tag attachment site influenced attachment longevity. The linear distances traversed by tagged dolphins ranged between 13.4 to 39.4 km (mean: 28.1 ± 9.4 km). While shallow water (< 1 m) habitats were frequently utilized (42.8% observations), dolphins selected deeper waters based on availability. Activity budgets differed between individuals and age-classes and were associated with water depth. Foraging and play behavior were observed significantly more in the shallowest water (≤ 1 m). Dolphins exhibited a high number of low-level associations (mean: 25.0 ± 14.58; range: 8 to 43 marked individuals), while one male individual exhibited a high-level male association (coefficient of association [COA] = 0.88) and a moderately high-level female association (COA = 0.67). This study represents the most extensive radio-tracking effort for IRL dolphins; it established radio-telemetry as a useful method to evaluate seasonal ranging patterns and provided important baseline data on short-term association patterns, activity budgets, and habitat use. Future studies that incorporate remote tracking capabilities, increased time and sample sizes, and nocturnal behavior are warranted to expand our understanding of movement patterns and habitat utilization. © 2019 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: A captive Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin named "Jedol" was released from a zoo into the wild, in Jeju Island Sea off South Korea, in July 2013 to improve his welfare. Since he was illegally captured off the coast of Juju Island in May 2009, he had been performing in dolphin shows at Seoul Zoo, which is owned and operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The release demanded considerable public expenditure, of which the source was local taxes gathered from the residents of Seoul. This paper seeks to conduct an ex-post evaluation of the release, employing the contingent valuation (CV) technique. A total of 500 households living in Seoul in 2013 participated in the CV survey to report their willingness to pay (WTP) for the release. Fifty-two percent were willing to accept an increase in local taxes over the next five years to carry out the release. The mean household WTP estimate was obtained as KRW 4880 (USD 4.56) per annum. The present values of the total WTP and the cost of the release are KRW 79.82 billion (USD 74.53 million) and KRW 751 million (USD 701,000), respectively, in 2013. Interestingly, the former is much more than the latter. We can conclude that the release was desirable from the point of view of Seoul residents. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Tattoo skin disease (TSD) is a poxviral disease typical of cetaceans. Two juvenile and well-preserved male striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), found stranded along the Tuscany and Latium coasts of Italy in 2015 and 2016, respectively, showed typical skin lesions ascribable to TSD. Histological, ultrastructural and biomolecular investigations confirmed a poxviral aetiology for the aforementioned skin lesions. To our knowledge, this should be the first report of TSD in cetaceans stranded along the Italian coastline. As organochlorines like PCBs and DDTs are known to be highly immunotoxic, the tissue loads of these contaminants were evaluated, in order to increase our knowledge on their potential role as well as on the relationships between the level of exposure to these pollutants and poxviral infection's occurrence. © 2018 Cocumelli, Fichi, Marsili, Senese, Cardeti, Cersini, Ricci, Garibaldi, Scholl, Di Guardo and Terracciano.

ABSTRACT: Several hormones are potential indicators of stress in free-ranging animals and provide information on animal health in managed-care settings. In response to stress, glucocorticoids (GC, e.g. cortisol) first appear in circulation but are later incorporated into other tissues (e.g. adipose) or excreted in feces or urine. These alternative matrices can be sampled remotely, or by less invasive means, than required for blood collection and are especially valuable in highly mobile species, like marine mammals. We characterized the timing and magnitude of several hormones in response to a stressor in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and the subsequent incorporation of cortisol into blubber, and its metabolites excreted in feces. We evaluated the endocrine response to an acute stressor in bottlenose dolphins under managed care. We used a standardized stress protocol where dolphins voluntarily beached onto a padded platform and remained out of water for two hours; during the stress test blood samples were collected every 15 min and blubber biopsies were collected every hour (0, 60, and 120 min). Each subject was studied over five days: voluntary blood samples were collected on each of two days prior to the stress test; 1 and 2 h after the conclusion of the out-of-water stress test; and on the following two days after the stress test. Fecal samples were collected daily, each afternoon. The acute stressor resulted in increases in circulating ACTH, cortisol, and aldosterone during the stress test, and each returned to baseline levels within 2 h of the dolphin's return to water. Both cortisol and aldosterone concentrations were correlated with ACTH, suggesting both corticosteroids are at least partly regulated by ACTH. Thyroid hormone concentrations were generally unaffected by the acute stressor. Blubber cortisol increased during the stress test, and fecal GC excretion was elevated on the day of the stress test. We found that GCs in bottlenose dolphins can recover within hours of acute stress, and that cortisol release can be detected in alternate matrices within a few hours—within 2 h in blubber, and 3.5–5 h in fecal samples. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Male mammals employ a wide variety of mating strategies in order to increase their reproductive success, which in turn influence their social behavior. In some populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), males cooperate in small groups or alliances to gain access to females for mating. However, the occurrence of these male cooperative groups has been predicted to occur only under certain social and ecological conditions, driven by factors such as differences in population density, operational sex ratio, and sexual size dimorphism. Here, we used generalized affiliation indices, social network techniques, and maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers to investigate the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness among male southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in a small embayment in South Australia. Photo-identification data and biopsy samples were collected in Coffin Bay from 2013 to 2015 through systematic boat-based surveys. We found that highly sighted male dolphins formed 12 social clusters composed of two to five individuals. Genetic analyses revealed that general male affiliation patterns were significantly correlated with mtDNA haplotype sharing. In addition, preferred affiliates showed significantly higher levels of genetic relatedness compared to casual and avoided male pairs. Our results corroborate theoretical expectations for the formation of social bonds in small delphinids and suggest that a high density of dolphins, with an expected skewed operational sex ratio and no apparent sexual size dimorphism, is likely to have favored the formation of strong male affiliations. In addition, the availability of genetic relatives within the population may have favored male affiliations based on kinship relationships. Significance statement: Male bottlenose dolphins use different strategies to gain access to females, from single roving individuals, pairs or trios in alliances, to stable mixed-sex groups. Moreover, the role of kinship in the formation of male social bonds also varies within and among populations. This variability has been attributed to differences in ecological and intrinsic factors. Here, we studied the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins and demonstrated that kinship plays an important role in the formation of close male social ties. Furthermore, the results corroborate previous findings about the factors that contribute to the formation of male social bonds in these animals. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Dolphins use their sophisticated biosonar to achieve complex underwater detection tasks, and it has been proved that dolphin can prey small fish, hidden in the sediment, by using dolphin echolocation pulses. Dolphin echolocation pulses (click) is a kind of broadband and short acoustic signal, produced by echolocation dolphins when they detect, recognize and classify target. In this study, the acoustic transmission performance of a dolphin click was evaluated by using Finite element method. Using Biot’s theory, the sandy sediment was built in poroelasticity material. The water-sediment boundary was established by the module of multi-physics coupling. The reflection and refraction coefficients of dolphin click were calculated by Fourier synthesis method. Based on refraction coefficient, the critical angle was estimated. The results of finite element model shed some light on the reasons why the dolphin can prey the small fish hidden in sediment, and it also shows a promising way to design a bio-inspired sonar for buried target detection. © 2018 IEEE

ABSTRACT: The pigmentation patterns of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins have not been well studied throughout most of the species' range. In the present study, both the subjective scoring method and a newly developed quantified scoring method were employed to evaluate the spotting intensity of 137 humpback dolphin individuals from the Xiamen and Beibu Gulf putative populations, including the Dafengjiang-Nanliujiang River Estuary (DRE) and Shatian- Caotan (SC) communities. Both scoring methods indicated that spotting intensity on the dorsal fin was lower than that on the body of humpback dolphins in all 3 groups. The SC and DRE humpback dolphins had significantly greater dorsal fin, body spotting intensity, and greater differences between spotting on the dorsal fin and body than Xiamen dolphins, while no differences were found between SC and DRE. The pigmentation variation is related to age class, young dolphins have more spotting density than adults, and young and adults showed similar geographical variation as above. The present paper, in combination with previous research, clarifies the general pattern of pigmentation for Chinese humpback dolphins. Eastern Taiwan Strait and Pearl River Estuary populations represent 2 extreme patterns of pigmentation, while the Xiamen population, SC community, and DRE community seem to be intermediate. The results suggest that these groups should be viewed as demographically distinct forms. © 2018 American Society of Mammalogists.

ABSTRACT: Stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N from liver and muscle) was used to assess trophic relationships between Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) (Thunnus thynnus) and striped dolphin (SC) (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG). δ15N values from ABFT muscle and liver tissues were significantly different from those of dolphin samples, but no for δ13C values. Diet estimation by MixSIAR models from muscle and liver revealed that ABFT fed mainly on squids (Todaropsis eblanae and Illex coindetii). The shrimp Pasiphaea sp. was estimated to be the most important prey-species in the diet of SC. Trophic positions estimated from muscle and liver isotopic data suggested that ABFT occupy a higher trophic level than SC. Estimations of isotopic niche, as measured by the standard ellipse area, indicated that ABFT show a broader trophic niche than SC; furthermore, SEAc did not show trophic overlap between both predators. The results of this study suggest that resource partitioning occurs between ABFT and SC in the SoG ecosystem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Computer aided sperm analysis systems allow detailed examination of sperm motility and morphology variables, which are important for the understanding of the spermatology of a species and the development of assisted reproductive techniques. Cetacean biology is too complex to study in the wild and data from captive individuals provide an important alternative for the conservation of these charismatic animals. The present study evaluates ejaculate and sperm characteristics, including sperm motility, kinematic variables and quantitative sperm morphology and ultrastructure, of consecutive ejaculates from Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Sperm concentrations and total and progressive motilities were greater in the second than the first ejaculate, with all ejaculates being of very high quality (6.9–1127 × 106/ml sperm concentration, 75% to 91% total motility and 89% to 96% normal sperm). Most sperm in an ejaculate (≥84%) were highly (VCL>150 μm/s) and progressively motile with very few abnormal sperm. The sperm have small heads, a short but very bulky midpiece and a long tail. Detailed sperm morphometrics using CASA indicated there were similarities from one ejaculate to the next. The large mitochondria with extensive cristae mitochondriales are tightly packed in the midpiece resulting in a large midpiece volume. All the semen and sperm characteristics indicate high quality sperm and support the assumption that a multimale mating system is present in T. truncatus. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Complex social structure is a prominent feature in several mammal species. Such structure may lead to behavioural diversity not only among populations, but also within a single population, where different subsets of a population may exhibit different types of behaviour. As a consequence, understanding social structure is not only interesting biologically, but may also help conservation and management efforts, because not all segments of a population necessarily respond to or interact with human activities in the same way, or at the same time. In this study, we examined the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Gulf of Trieste and adjacent waters (northern Adriatic Sea), based on a 9-year dataset, using social network metrics and association indices. We assessed whether different segments of the population show differences in behaviour and interactions with fisheries. Dolphin social network was structured into distinct social clusters of mixed sexes. We found no evidence of male alliances. The two largest social clusters overlapped spatially, but not temporally, as they used the same area at different times of day. Such diel temporal partitioning does not appear to have been documented in cetaceans previously. The two clusters also differed in ways they interact with fisheries, as one regularly interacted with trawlers, while the other did not. This study demonstrates how different segments of animal populations can interact differently with human activities and in turn respond differently to anthropogenic impacts. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Aim: The heterogeneity of the marine environment is thought to be the origin of marine biodiversity, often delineated in marine biogeographical provinces. Cetaceans are highly mobile aquatic mammals, but even those species inhabiting seemingly boundary-free open waters are found to exhibit degrees of population structure, often attributed to ecological and behavioural factors such as resource specialization and site fidelity. Our aim in this study is to test the hypothesis that a cosmopolitan, resource-specialist dolphin species, the Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) will show an association between genetic diversity and biogeographical provinces. Location: North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Methods: We examined genetic variation at 19 microsatellite loci among 236 samples collected from a range of locations in the North Pacific Ocean, and for a 473 bp mitochondrial DNA control region sequence in 213 samples from the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans to assess genetic diversity, population structure and historic population dynamics. Results: We found differentiation in the North Pacific primarily among three populations corresponding to the marine biogeographical provinces of the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (Sino-Japanese), California Current (California), and Eastern Tropical Pacific. Analyses using mitochondrial DNA data further reveal that these three populations are genetically different from the populations in the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, without strong lineage sorting, and that the western North Pacific population experienced a period of population expansion while the Eastern Tropical Pacific population remained stable. Main conclusions: We find evidence for biogeographical endemism in a highly mobile marine mammal species that nevertheless shows evidence for long-range dispersion within and to a lesser extent among biogeographical provinces. We conclude that distinct ecological processes promote differentiation, even though this species forages on narrow range of prey species. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Paracoccidioidomycosis ceti is a cutaneous disease of cetaceans caused by uncultivated Paracoccidioides brasiliensis or Paracoccidioides spp. Serological cross-reactions between paracoccidioidomycosis ceti and paracoccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis and coccidioidomycosis have been reported before. The present study aimed to detect immunohistochemical cross-reaction between antibodies to Paracoccidioides sp. and Histoplasma capsulatum, and vice versa. Thirty murine sera, obtained from experimental infections of 6 isolates of H. capsulatum, were reacted with paraffin-embedded yeast-form cells of Paracoccidioides sp. derived from a case of paracoccidioidomycosis ceti in Japan. The murine sera were also reacted with human isolates of H. capsulatum yeast cells, with P. brasiliensis yeast cells, and with fungal cells of Coccidioides posadasii. Three dolphins’ sera from cases of paracoccidioidomycosis ceti, two human sera from patients with paracoccidioidomycosis, and a serum from a healthy person with a history of coccidioidomycosis were used in order to determine that the tested fungal cells reacted properly. Sera derived from mice infected with an isolate of H. capsulatum reacted positively against yeast cells of Paracoccidioides sp., yeast cells of P. brasiliensis, and fungal cells of C. posadasii, while those derived from other strains were negative. The present study recorded for the first time the cross-reaction between the yeast cells of H. capsulatum and antibodies against Paracoccidioides spp., the yeast cells of Paracoccidioides sp. and antibodies against H. capsulatum, the yeast cells of Paracoccidioides sp. and antibodies against Coccidioides sp., and fungal cells of C. posadasii and antibodies against Paracoccidioides spp. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the aquatic environment is an issue of major concern which may be a cause of increasing prevalence and severity of diseases in marine mammals. Although, cell culture model development and in vitro investigation approach is a prime need of time to progress immunotoxic research on aquatic mammals. In this study, we stablished fibroblast cell line (pantropic spotted dolphin) to assess the potential effects of PBDEs on cytokines response. Cells were grown in 6 well cell culture plate and complete media (DMEM and Ham's F12 nutrient mixture, fetal bovine serum, antibiotic and essential amino acids) was provided. The primary culture of (PSP-LWH) cells identification was achieved by vimentin (gene and protein) expressions. Karyotyping revealed pantropic spotted dolphin chromosomes 20 pairs with XX. Transfection was achieved by SV40 LT antigen and transfected cells were expended for passages. Stability of cell line was confirmed at various passages intervals using RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence methods. After confirmation, cell line was exposed to BDE-47 (250 ng/ml), BDE-100 (250 ng/ml) and BDE-209 (1000 ng/ml), with control group (PBS), positive control DMSO (0.1%) and negative control LPS (500 ng/ml) for 24 h. The ELISA results showed significant increase in IL-6 in BDE- 100 and BDE-209 while IL-1β and IL-8 were found higher in BDE-47 and BDE-100. TNFα and IL-10 secretion was noted higher in control and positive control groups. Altogether, these results emphasize importance of transfected (PSP-LWHT) cell line in aquatic research and potential effects of PBDEs on fibroblast provides evident to understand immune modulating effects of PBDEs in marine mammals. The impact of PBDEs on dolphin's fibroblast cells immune response and altered cytokine response have been presented for the first time. © 2018

ABSTRACT: We report the gross and microscopic findings and molecular identification of fungal hyphate infection in a juvenile female Atlantic spotted dolphin Stenella frontalis found dead off Arguineguin, Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). On necropsy examination, the animal had a large cranial intrathoracic mass and multiple variably-sized nodules throughout the larynx and trachea that obliterated the lumen. Microscopically, the masses were composed of abundant pyogranulomatous inflammation with numerous fungal hyphae. These were pauciseptate (coenocytic) and had non-parallel walls, non-dichotomous irregular to right angle branching, and bulbous dilations. PCR analysis from these inflammatory foci yielded Rhizopus arrhizus (syn. R. oryzae). This fungal pathogen is often ascribed to opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed humans and animals. In the present case, a potential cause for immunosuppression was not identified; PCR analysis for cetacean morbillivirus was negative. Herein, we report the first confirmed case of R. arrhizus infection in a free-living Atlantic cetacean. These findings add to the body of knowledge on fungal disease in cetaceans in general and, in particular, in odontocetes, where respiratory involvement is common. © Inter-Research 2018.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Defining intra-population community variation in group living mammals provides insights about the impact of environmental, social, and anthropogenic factors on population sub-structuring. Here, we use generalised affiliation indices (GAIs) and social network analysis to investigate social cohesion and intra-population community structure of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) inhabiting Adelaide’s metropolitan coast in South Australia. Information on the sex and site fidelity of photographically identified individuals was used to investigate the potential link between these parameters and preferred affiliations at the population level. Genetic data was also used to investigate genetic relatedness within and between sex and communities. Overall, dolphins showed non-random associations, with preferred associates prominent amongst females and resident individuals. Dolphins were clustered into two social communities that showed little spatial overlap and were associated with different habitats: a northern, shallow-water community (NSWC) and a southern, deep-water community (SDWC). As expected, preferred associations were more prevalent within than between communities, and analyses of genetic relatedness indicated that dolphins, particularly females, were on average more related within than between communities. Social network metrics varied between communities, with the temporal stability of associations for both communities characterised by rapid disassociations and casual acquaintances. We suggest that these two dolphin communities likely arose due to a combination of ecological and socio-genetic factors. This study enhances our understanding of factors shaping social groups in long-lived mammals and our ability to manage human activities that can impact upon their behaviour and social structure. Significance statement: Determining how and why individual animals interact and form groups is important for understanding the evolution of sociality and designing management strategies for wildlife conservation. We investigated association patterns and social community structure in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins in Gulf waters of South Australia. Within the study area, dolphins were divided into two separate communities associated with different habitat types. Within these two communities, dolphins formed groups with particular individuals and mostly related individuals amongst females. These findings enhance our understanding of the factors shaping mammalian groups and our ability to manage human activities that can impact upon their behaviour and social structure. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: During 2013–2015, an outbreak of dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) occurred in the western North Atlantic, which resulted in the stranding of over 1,600 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). There are currently five coastal and 10 bay, sound, and estuary dolphin stocks along the U.S. Atlantic coast, yet there is very limited understanding of which stocks were exposed to DMV during the recent outbreak, or how DMV was transmitted across stocks. In order to address these questions, information is needed on spatial overlap and stock interactions. The goals of this project were to determine ranging patterns, prevalence of DMV, and spatial overlap of the South Carolina-Georgia (SC-GA) Coastal Stock, and adjacent Southern Georgia Estuarine System (SGES) Stock. During September 2015, a health assessment and telemetry study was conducted in which 19 dolphins were captured, tested for antibodies to DMV, and satellite tagged. Dolphins were classified into one of three ranging patterns (Coastal, Sound, or Estuary) based upon telemetry data. Coastal dolphins (likely members of the SC-GA Coastal Stock) had a significantly higher prevalence of positive DMV antibody titers (0.67; N = 2/3), than Sound and Estuary dolphins (likely members of the SGES Stock) (0.13; N = 2/16). These results suggest that the SC-GA Coastal Stock may have experienced greater exposure to DMV as compared to the SGES Stock. However, due to the small size of the SGES Stock and its exposure to high levels of persistent contaminants, this stock may be particularly vulnerable to DMV infection in the future. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Sardine Sardina pilchardus, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and European hake Merluccius merluccius represent a significant part of the commercial landings in the Gulf of Lions (northwestern Mediterranean Sea). However, their stocks have shown severe declines during the last decades due to fishing pressure and/or environmental changes. The aim of this study was to estimate the current predation pressure of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba — which are abundant in the area — on sardine, anchovy and hake. To do so, we developed an original approach based on several data sets and models (aerial surveys, stomach contents, allometric and stock assessment models) and Monte Carlo simulations to incorporate various sources of uncertainty due to data limitations. Despite the uncertainties, the results showed that dolphin predation pressure on sardine and anchovy was extremely low in the Gulf of Lions (all simulations < 0.5 % of the available stock), indicating little impact of dolphins on those populations. However, significant predation pressure on hake (median value: 23 %) was detected, a value which might have doubled in the last 30 yr because of hake overfishing. Over-exploitation has thus reinforced the natural mortality of hake due to dolphin predation, but this predation pressure remains 2 to 3 times lower than that exerted by fisheries. © Inter-Research 2018.

ABSTRACT: This study was designed to investigate the effects of restrictive and cyclical feeding on the growth parameters of dolphin cichlid (Cyrtocara moorii Boulenger, 1902). In the study, 300 dolphin cichlid with an initial average weight of 1.12 ± 0.23 g were placed in 15 aquariums (each of them were 60 L). The five experimental groups, were designed as; the control group (A), feeding until satiation twice a day for 90 days, starvation for 1 week (B), starvation for 2 weeks (C), starvation for 1 day/satiation for 3 days (D), starvation for 1 day/satiation for 1 day (E); and the study was carried out in three repetitions. At the end of the study, groups B, C and D showed partial compensatory growth. The highest weight gains and specific growth rates were observed in control group (A), followed by groups B, C and D (p > 0.05). The lowest weight gain was observed in group E (p < 0.05). The feed conversion ratio did not show any significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). In terms of feed consumption ratio, Control, C and D groups consumed similar amounts of feed (p > 0.05), while B and E groups consumed less feed (p < 0.05) than the other groups. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Historical strandings and sightings (1989-2016) of Tursiops truncatus at 25oS in the south-western Atlantic Ocean (Paraná, Brazil) were assessed to (1) investigate temporal fluctuations; and (2) quantify biological, ecological and health parameters of regional populations. In total, 57 T. truncatus carcasses in mostly advanced stages of decomposition (~80% of all specimens) were recorded. Standardized temporal strandings (per observational effort) varied considerably and with no clear annual relationship beyond a peak in 2007, but there were consistently more strandings in winter/spring (74%) than summer/autumn (26%). While there was uncertainty over age estimation (i.e. not available for the population), individuals classified as juveniles/subadults were more frequent (80%) than calves (14%) and adults (6%). Of 28 carcasses assessed, 27 showed a positive linear relationship between TL and condyle-basal length, while one specimen had a clear southern skull morphotype. Suggestive lesions of Crassicauda sp. were recorded in 77% of assessed skulls and four types of tooth pathologies were observed. Nine individuals were more closely investigated for gross and histopathological alterations and had clear evidence of fishery interactions and various health issues associated with disease and oedema accompanied by alveolar fibrosis. While the regional frequency of T. truncatus strandings was lower than other more vulnerable cetaceans, the absolute numbers (e.g. 15 individuals in 2016) and some uncertainty concerning regional taxonomy are noteworthy, and justify ongoing spatio-temporal monitoring. Further, given the evidence of disease in some specimens, future work should not only encompass rigorous taxonomic assessments, but also health to comprehensively evaluate regional stocks. Small cetacean species are sentinels and their condition could inform ongoing environmental assessments. Copyright © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2018.

ABSTRACT: Several cetacean species have demonstrated epimeletic behavior that relies on the tight social bonds between conspecifics. These behaviors and the corresponding vocalizations were recorded during a rare encounter with a group of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) that included a presumed mother and deceased calf, in Sanniang Bay, China. The observed dolphins were divided into 2 apparent groups: 1) a central group with the presumed mother and her deceased calf, along with 1 to 6 other individuals swimming in synchrony with the presumed mother; and 2) a following group of several individuals, dispersed over varying distances from approximately 20 to > 300 m, that swam in the same direction as the central group. The mother was seen mostly supporting the calf's body using her back, anterior to the dorsal fin and posterior to the melon, while the other members of the central group exhibited standing-by behaviors (i.e., remaining close to the deceased calf but not providing aid). Whistles in this context were of a longer duration and a higher complexity in the frequency modulation compared to social contexts. Several whistle types were also repeated frequently. This paper provides a detailed description of epimeletic behavior and the whistles possibly associated with that behavior in an endangered population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. © 2018 American Society of Mammalogists, www.mammalogy.org.

ABSTRACT: Activities displayed by animals are usually cyclic, and fluctuations in behavioural repertoires can be observed on a daily or seasonal timescale. The present study describes daily and seasonal variations in the aerial events - such as leaps, spins and slaps with body parts - by spinner dolphins in Baía dos Golfinhos, Fernando de Noronha Marine National Park, in Brazil. To measure aerial events by dolphins, we compiled and analysed data collected from January 2006 to December 2010. A total of 113,027 aerial events were recorded during 1431 days of land-based daytime observations. Our results show that the frequency of aerial events was positively correlated with the number of dolphins in the bay. The relative frequency of aerial events was higher in the rainy season, when compared with the dry season. Aerial activities also varied throughout the day, with dolphins being more active in the morning, specifically from 8:00 a.m. to 8:59 a.m., regardless of the season.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the factors that contribute to a population’s habitat use is important for conservation planners and managers to identify reasons behind a population’s distribution. Habitat use often differs between sexes, however few studies on sexually monomorphic species document this difference, resulting in misleading ecological interpretations and non-targeted management actions. The aim of this study was to test for sex-specific differences in the seasonal habitat use of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) off Bunbury, Australia. Systematic, boat-based, photographic identification dolphin surveys (n = 587) were conducted across seasons over 6 years during 2007–2013. Generalised additive models explored relationships between the presence-absence of dolphins and sex, water depth and benthic habitat type. Results highlighted that: (i) habitat use differed seasonally for males and females, (ii) depth had a strong influence on habitat use, which differed between sexes for summer, winter and spring, and (iii) there were no sex differences in habitat use in autumn, which coincides with the peak breeding season. In summer and autumn dolphins were concentrated in shallow, near-shore waters predominantly over reef and sand, and in winter and spring dolphins had a broader distribution over reef and mud/silt with the use of deeper, offshore waters. This pattern is consistent with the seasonally-dependent dolphin abundance that has been documented for this population. Identification of sex differences in habitat use provides management agencies with insights to implement informed actions for the conservation of this coastal dolphin population which is forecast to decline by 50% in the next two decades. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) is a small-bodied dolphin distributed along the Atlantic coast from Honduras to southern Brazil. It preys on fish, squid and shrimps. Several seminal studies have described its diet, yet relationships between the species’ feeding plasticity and climate gradients remain unknown. We compiled a large database of Guiana dolphin stomach remains from southeast coastal Brazil. We described the species’ diet using a number of descriptors, multivariate analysis of variance to test possible differentiation in diet composition, and the Morisita index to estimate the extent of trophic niche overlap between groups. We also analysed feeding plasticity using a regression tree analysis followed by an ordination analysis. We present new records of prey for the species in Brazil. Our results suggest that the Guiana dolphin has opportunistic feeding habits, which may exhibit the species’ feeding plasticity. Such feeding plasticity is associated with the capability to prey throughout a wide array of climate conditions. From a conservation ecology perspective, we conclude that estuaries—even ones that are over-depleted and succumbing to human impacts—are paramount environments for the Guiana dolphin, serving as important sources of prey for the species and other sympatric marine mammals. © 2018 CSIC.

ABSTRACT: Social learning of adaptive behaviour is widespread in animal populations, but the spread of arbitrary behaviours is less common. In this paper, we describe the rise and fall of a behaviour called tail walking, where a dolphin forces the majority of its body vertically out of the water and maintains the position by vigourously pumping its tail, in a community of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). The behaviour was introduced into the wild following the rehabilitation of a wild female individual, Billie, who was temporarily co-housed with trained dolphins in a dolphinarium. This individual was sighted performing the behaviour seven years after her 1988 release, as was one other female dolphin named Wave. Initial production of the behaviour was rare, but following Billie's death two decades after her release, Wave began producing the behaviour at much higher rates, and several other dolphins in the community were subsequently sighted performing the behaviour. Social learning is the most likely mechanism for the introduction and spread of this unusual behaviour, which has no known adaptive function. These observations demonstrate the potential strength of the capacity for spontaneous imitation in bottlenose dolphins, and help explain the origin and spread of foraging specializations observed in multiple populations of this genus. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Many comparative studies have focused on the emergence of solitary and social play in early development, however, few consider observer and parallel forms of play. In this study, we analyzed approximately 21 h of video recordings and revealed a significant difference between the frequency of solitary, observer, parallel, and social object play states, in calf, juvenile, subadult, and adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). While juveniles engaged in solitary play significantly more than other age groups, both juveniles and calves engaged in observer and social play significantly more than adults and subadults. Within their own age group, calves, juveniles, and subadults all showed a significant preference for solitary play. Calves preferred juvenile partners, while juveniles preferred calves during social play and other juveniles during observer play. Calves and juveniles preferred non-kin partners, especially during observer play. Together, these results have implications for social learning and behavioral transmission through observational play. With this knowledge, we can provide the appropriate social environment to dolphins in managed care with limited or constrained social availability, increasing learning opportunities and developmental outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Plastic debris is currently recognised as one of the major global threats to marine life. However, few data exist on the presence and abundance of microplastics (plastics < 5 mm in size) in marine mammals. This is the first record of the presence of microplastics in the digestive tracts of marine mammals from the Iberian Peninsula. This study made use of 35 samples of common dolphin stomach contents. Microplastics were identified in all the samples analysed, an average of 12 items per stomach although abundance varied widely from one stomach to another. Most plastic items were small fibres although some fragments and a bead were also found. Excluding the smallest fibres as possible airborne contamination, the estimated occurrence of microplastics could drop to as low as 94%. Although factors affecting accumulation of microplastics and their effect on common dolphins are unknown, the fact that all stomachs analysed contained microplastics is a cause for concern. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Coastal waters of the Valencia region are important habitats for bottlenose dolphins, but also important fishing grounds for artisanal fisheries. No studies have been carried out here to investigate the overlap and interactions between the fishing grounds and dolphin habitat. The present study aims to assess the potential occurrence of interactions between artisanal fisheries and bottlenose dolphins in these waters. Face to face interviews were conducted to investigate for the first time artisanal fishermen's perceptions of their interactions with bottlenose dolphins. A total of 131 fishermen (40.1% of the artisanal fleet for the Valencia region) participated of research. Among the interviewed fishermen, 86.1% perceived that dolphins damaged fishing gear as they attempted to feed, and they also detected significant direct damage to fish. Of all fishermen reporting a negative interaction with bottlenose dolphins, 76.3% also reported financial loss (2907.1 ± 2512.7 €/year (100–12,000). Despite the high level of interaction with dolphins reported, fishermen do not consider bycatch to be an important threat for bottlenose dolphins. Our results show geographical differences in fishermen's perceptions of damage caused by dolphins: while dolphins were considered to be the second cause of economic loss in the southernmost ports, fishermen from the northern ports considered interaction with bottom trawl boats to be more harmful than interaction with dolphins. The more intense interaction reported by fishermen in fishing ports in the southern study area may be associated with higher presence of bottlenose dolphin in these zones. Our study provides a useful insight into fishermen's perceptions of interaction between bottlenose dolphins and artisanal fisheries in this key area for the species in the western Mediterranean Sea. It also highlights the need for future work including direct observations of interactions and damage to gather reliable data to assess the need for conservation measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Impact pile-driving generates loud underwater anthropogenic sounds, and is routinely conducted in harbours around the world. Surprisingly few studies of these sounds and their propagation are published in the primary literature. To partially redress this we studied pile-driving sounds in Lyttelton Harbour, New Zealand, during wharf reconstruction after earthquake damage. That Lyttelton harbour is routinely used by Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori), an endangered species found only in New Zealand, provided further context for this study. Steel piles of 0.61 or 0.71 m diameter were driven using three different pile-drivers. Maximum calculated source SEL was 192 dB re 1 μPa2s @ 1 m (SPL0−p of 213 dB re 1 μPa @ 1 m). Propagation of piling noise was strongly influenced by harbour bathymetry and a rock breakwater near the piling operation. We calculated range estimates at which Hector's dolphins may suffer temporary hearing threshold shift and behavioural change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Very little information is available on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) habitat use in the South-western Atlantic. It is, however, essential in understanding their ecology and to improve conservation management. In this study, habitat use of bottlenose dolphins was examined in Bahía San Antonio, an area frequented by the species. Given the large tidal amplitude and extended intertidal zone in this bay, special focus was given to the intertidal vs subtidal habitat use patterns. Bottlenose dolphins were observed in only half of the surveyed area, with on average 1 dolphin group encountered per 100 km surveyed. All dolphin groups were seen in shallow waters <10 m deep. GLM analyses showed that especially during high tide, depth had an important effect on the dolphin encounter rate, with most dolphin groups encountered in the intertidal zone. While in the intertidal zone, most dolphin groups were observed to be engaged in surface feeding activities. The presented data indicate dolphins remained in shallow waters, and moved to the intertidal zone during high tide where they appear to find feeding opportunities. This information is believed to be of high value in understanding this population's ecological needs, and essential when aiming to improve marine conservation efforts at times of increased anthropogenic pressures in the area.

ABSTRACT: Population genomic data can be used to infer historical effective population sizes (Ne), which help study the impact of past climate changes on biodiversity. Previous genome sequencing of one individual of the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus revealed an unusual, sharp rise in Ne during the last glacial, raising questions about the reliability, generality, underlying cause, and biological implication of this finding. Here we first verify this result by additional sampling of T. truncatus. We then sequence and analyze the genomes of its close relative, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin T. aduncus. The two species exhibit contrasting demographic changes in the last glacial, likely through actual changes in population size and/or alterations in the level of gene flow among populations. Our findings suggest that even closely related species can have drastically different responses to climatic changes, making predicting the fate of individual species in the ongoing global warming a serious challenge. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus M.) local population off west Istria in the North-eastern Adriatic has received no prior study of abundance and distribution despite the habitat's relevance for the preservation of this key species in the marine ecosystem. The research area comprises part of the NATURA 2000 network which was predominantly established here for these dolphins. Official data regarding the local population's status in the region are currently marked as deficient. Thus, the aim of the present study was to provide the first population data for the area. Boat-based survey work was carried out from April to September 2012-2015 using a mark-recapture photo-identification method. Prior to this period a random data collection was used to study distribution, since 2001, to cover the area of 927 km2 lying between Umag to lighthouse AlbaneŽ in the south. 143 bottlenose dolphins were photo-identified to date with the average group size of 9.27 ± 6.53 animals. Several abundance models were used, from which the Markovian robust model proved the best fit and predicted between 47-142 dolphins along the west Istria coast. A few individuals were also identified in Slovenia, indicating a bigger home range along the 98 km length of the studied area. There is an indication of a regular year round presence of dolphins. The west Istria coast constitutes an important feeding and breeding ground. The region should develop a sustainable plan to manage those human activities negatively impacting the dolphins. Therefore the present study is of relevance for the implementation of management directives for their conservation. Copyright © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2017.

ABSTRACT: The survival rate and population size of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Xiamen, China, were estimated from vessel-based surveys during 2007–2010. Over the course of 202 d (881.1 observation hours), 76 groups were observed, and 52 dolphins were successfully identified. The Cormack-Jolly-Seber model estimated a constant apparent survival of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.922–0.966). Based on the open/POPAN model, the population size was estimated at 70 individuals (95% CI: 63–88). To explore the effect of uneven yearly survey effort, we pooled the data with seven sampling occasions with similar effort. This data set generated similar results of a constant survival of 0.957 (95% CI: 0.918–0.978) and population size of 72 (95% CI: 65–88). The small population size of the Xiamen humpback dolphins satisfies the Critically Endangered criterion of IUCN (D), and emphasizes urgency of the need for protection of the population. Improved monitoring efforts should be focused on enhancing our understanding of current status and evaluating impacts of all anthropogenic activities. A conservation plan for the population should also be drawn up. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Marine mammal populations often have “hotspots” of distribution. Understanding what drives these is important for understanding relationships with habitat and evaluating exposure to threats. Few studies investigate the stability of hotspots, yet this information is vital in assessing their importance. In this study, over 9,000 sightings made during systematic surveys over 29 yr are used to establish the existence, locations, and temporal dynamics of hotspots for Hector's dolphins at Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. Sightings were divided into four seasons and three time periods to assess temporal trends in habitat use. Kernel density analysis was performed on sightings, weighted by survey effort. Density values at hotspots and reference areas were modeled according to season and time period using linear mixed models. Fifty percent of weighted sightings (n = 4,513) occurred within 21% of the study area. Hotspots had significantly higher densities during summer and these high-density areas have remained consistent over time. Such consistency implies importance of these areas to the dolphins' ecology. This information adds to our knowledge of how this endangered species uses its habitat, suggests candidate areas for protection from threats, and provides a baseline for assessing habitat related impacts on Hector's dolphins at Banks Peninsula.© 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The earliest evidence of cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) infection dates from 1982, when the dolphin morbillivirus strain (DMV) was identified in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus stranded in the mid-Atlantic region. Since then, CeMV has been detected globally in at least 26 species of mysticetes and odontocetes, causing widespread mortality and a wide range of pathological effects. In the Canary Islands, DMV and pilot whale morbillivirus have been detected in cetacean species, including short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus and bottlenose dolphins. Risso’s dolphins Grampus griseus have been reported year-round in waters of the Canary Islands and are considered a resident species. No information is currently available on CeMV prevalence in this species in this ocean region. We searched for evidence of CeMV infection in 12 Risso’s dolphins stranded in the Canary Islands from 2003 to 2015 by means of histopathology, PCR and immunohistochemistry. PCR revealed 2 CeMV-positive animals (16.6%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains from the 2 positive specimens were phylogenetically quite distant, proving that more than 1 strain infects the Risso’s dolphin population in this region. We also determined that the strain detected in one of the specimens mainly circulated in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from 2007 to 2013. © Inter-Research 2018.

ABSTRACT: The prevalence of scars and wounds of anthropogenic origin was assessed in seven different coastal bottlenose dolphin communities (Tursiops truncatus) on the south-western coast of Ecuador. Between 2011 and 2017 a total of 117 trips were conducted representing a total sampled distance of 6281 km. Twenty-five of the 189 (13.2%) free-ranging photo-identified dolphins were recorded with dorsal fin damage, V-shaped wounds, sawed edges and deformities in the caudal region. The scarring prevalence ranged from 0 to 44.4% and was associated with either fishing interactions or vessel strikes. Dolphin scarring increased five times in the last 25 years from 2.2 to 11.1% and was correlated with a decrease in population in the inner estuary of the Gulf of Guayaquil. Damaged dorsal fins are associated mainly with fishing gear. V-shaped wounds were recorded in three different communities, Posorja, Estero Salado and Salinas, and given their severity associated with either fishing gear or vessel strikes. During the study period three dolphins were found entangled in fishing gears, two in gillnets and one in a long-line, emphasizing the threats posed by current fishing practice to the species. More effective management measures are urgently needed to reverse the observed population decline. This may include reduction of fishing effort, implementation of area-based approaches to coastal planning (including Marine Protected Area designations) and support for further research to understand the problem. Given the difficulty in taking direct observations, scarring prevalence is proposed as a proxy for estimating boat traffic and fishing gear impacts upon cetaceans.

ABSTRACT: Ranging behaviour and temporal patterns of individuals are known to be fundamental sources of variation in social networks. Spatiotemporal dynamics can both provide and inhibit opportunities for individuals to associate, and should therefore be considered in social analysis. This study investigated the social structure of a Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) population, which shows different spatiotemporal patterns of use and gregariousness between individuals. For this, we constructed an initial social network using association indices corrected for gregariousness and then uncovered affiliations from this social network using generalized affiliation indices. The association-based social network strongly supported that this dolphin population consists of four social units highly correlated to spatiotemporal use patterns. Excluding the effects of gregariousness and spatiotemporal patterns, the affiliation-based social network suggested an additional two social units. Although the affiliation-based social units shared a large part of their core areas, space and/or time use by individuals of the different units were generally distinct. Four of the units were strongly associated with both estuarine and shallow coastal areas, while the other two units were restricted to shallow coastal waters to the south (SC) and north of the estuary (NC), respectively. Interactions between individuals of different social units also occurred, but dolphins from the NC were relatively more isolated and mainly connected to SC dolphins. From a conservation management perspective, it is recommended that information about the dolphin social units should be incorporated in modeling intrapopulation dynamics and viability, as well as for investigating patterns of gene flow among them. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Estimating the number of dolphins in a group is a challenging task. To assess the accuracy and precision of dolphin group size estimates, observer estimates were compared to counts from large-format vertical aerial photographs. During 11 research cruises, a total of 2,435 size estimates of 434 groups were made by 59 observers. Observer estimates were modeled as a function of the photo count in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Accuracy varied widely among observers, and somewhat less widely among dolphin species. Most observers tended to underestimate, and the tendency increased with group size. Groups of 25, 50, 100, and 500 were underestimated by <1%, 16%, 27%, and 47%, respectively, on average. Precision of group size estimates was low, and estimates were highly variable among observers for the same group. Predicted true group size, given an observer estimate, was larger than the observer estimate for groups of more than about 25 dolphins. Predicted group size had low precision, with coefficients of variation ranging from 0.7 to 1.9. Studies which depend on group size estimates will be improved if the tendency to underestimate group size and the high uncertainty of group size estimates are included in the analysis. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of growth patterns of an animal species is fundamental to understand their life history. This information is also used to help define population boundaries of threatened cetaceans, such as the Franciscana dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei. A total of 108 Franciscana dolphins incidentally captured in artisanal fishing nets in estuarine and marine coastal waters of the northern part of the Franciscana Management Area IV (North FMA IV), Argentina, were studied. The objective of the present paper was to study age and growth parameters of Franciscanas from North FMA IV and to compare these parameters between estuarine and marine potential populations within this area. We used von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth curves to model growth trajectories. The estimated asymptotic lengths demonstrated that Franciscana dolphins from this area were smaller (females: 136.3 cm and males, 122.1 cm) than southern FMA IV values previously published. They also showed the reverse sexual size dimorphism that is known across their range. However, the estimated asymptotic length was not statistically different between the estuarine and marine females within the study area. In spite of this, the fact that the northern forms of the FMA IV were smaller than the southern specimens supports the hypothesis of more than one population of the species within this management area. The North FMA IV has the highest reported mortality levels of Franciscana dolphins within the FMA IV; these results are relevant to the knowledge base of Franciscana dolphins in the region.

ABSTRACT: In this study, echolocation signals were recorded from a wild Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) in shallow water in the Bay of Brunei. During sound recording, a small fishing boat engine startled a nearby Irrawaddy dolphin and began chasing it on two occasions. Variations in the acoustic parameters were detected. When the Irrawaddy dolphin was startled and chased, the sound pressure level, number of click trains per minute, pulse number, and average inter-pulse interval (PI) per click train were all affected. The PI increased and exhibited a slight downward trend during the chase. The increase in PI indicated an increase in the inspection distance as the dolphin escaped. Thus, Irrawaddy dolphins may adapt their echolocation signals to stand out from ambient noise in the wild and to improve their search efforts in potentially risky situations. Appropriate management of the burst noise around the dolphins is important. © 2019, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis and tucuxi Sotalia fluviatilis are classified as Data Deficient species. Despite very limited knowledge on health and disease aspects of these species, the main threats to their conservation include incidental mortality in fishing gear, population fragmentation, habitat loss and environmental pollution. It is also suggested that underlying diseases may contribute to their mortality rates. Herein, we retrospectively describe gross and microscopic pulmonary lesions in free-ranging I. geoffrensis (n = 24) and S. fluviatilis (n = 28) found dead. Nearly 85% of the examined animals presented some kind of primary lung disease, wherein the main etiological diagnoses were verminous pneumonia by Halocercus brasiliensis (25%), bacterial pneumonia (25%) and a single case of meconium aspiration syndrome (1.9%). An etiology was not determined in 36.5% (19/52) of animals. These results indicate a high incidence of pulmonary pathology in these species, raising concerns about population impacts and potential zoonotic implications in some instances. These data may provide a scientific basis for future medical and conservation efforts focused on Amazonian dolphins. © The authors 2018.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) accumulate in the fat tissue of living organisms and are found in relatively high concentrations in animals at the top of the food chain, such as dolphins. The ability of these compounds to interact with the endocrine system of marine mammals constitutes a risk for the reproduction and conservation of species. The La Plata dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei, is exclusive to the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and is classified on the IUCN red list as a vulnerable species. Blubber, liver, kidney and muscle samples from four P. blainvillei mother-fetus pairs were analyzed to evaluate the transfer of POPs to fetal tissues through the placenta. The presence of POPs in fetal tissues indicates the maternal transfer of compounds. In the pregnant females, blubber was the tissue with POP highest concentration, followed by the liver, kidneys and muscles. In the fetuses, POP accumulation mainly occurred in the blubber followed by the muscles, liver and kidneys. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs) were found in all tissues analyzed and had the highest concentrations among all compounds. The main PCB congeners in the fetal samples had five to seven chlorine atoms. The only polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) in the fetal samples was 47 and was found only in blubber. The main DDT metabolite in the fetuses was p,p′-DDE. POP transfer via the placenta occurs in the first months of gestation and increases with fetal development, according to fetus/mother (F/M) ratio: HCB > DDT > PCB > PBDE > Mirex, which may follow the order of the octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) values. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring and assessment of the status of marine mammal populations is a requirement of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Due to the difficulty of collecting data in the marine environment and because many populations of these highly mobile species inhabit waters of several Member States, monitoring of marine mammals is particularly challenging. In the present work we have used a 10-year time-series of data collected from multidisciplinary research surveys to estimate common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) abundance and trends in continental shelf waters of the northwest Spanish sub-region. We argue that this approach provides a valuable addition to large-scale dedicated surveys, offering a shorter interval between surveys and hence offering the possibility to track abundance changes at a regional scale. Trends in the number of dolphins present in the study area over the last 10 years show a mean increase of about 9.6% per year, which results in an evaluation of Good Environmental Status for the species in the area using the abundance indicator adopted in the framework of the MSFD. Data obtained from dedicated dual-platform surveys have been used to correct the detection bias in our data collected using single-platforms (attraction toward the observation platform and animals missed on the track-line), to obtain absolute abundance estimates for calculating bycatch limits. The average abundance over the study period was 12,831 dolphins [CI 95%; 9025, 18,242] calculated with the conventional distance sampling methodology, 4747 [3307, 6816] corrected for attraction and missed animals on the track-line, and 22,510 [15,776, 32,120] corrected only for missed animals on the track-line. The estimated safe bycatch limit for this area calculated from these abundance values were 218 [153, 310], 81 [56, 115] and 383 [268, 546] per year, respectively. Comparing these figures with estimates based on different sources, the percentage of dolphins that die in this study area is higher than the maximum limit allowable under the OSPAR criteria for population mortality adopted as an indicator for the MSFD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Clinical and epidemiological features of tattoo skin disease (TSD) are reported for 257 common bottlenose dolphins held in 31 facilities in the Northern Hemisphere. Photographs and biological data of 146 females and 111 males were analyzed. Dolphins were classified into three age classes: 0–3 years, 4–8 years, and older than 9 years. From 2012 to 2014, 20.6% of the 257 dolphins showed clinical TSD. The youngest dolphins with tattoo lesions were 14 and 15 months old. TSD persisted from 4 to 65 months in 30 dolphins. Prevalence varied between facilities from 5.6% to 60%, possibly reflecting variation in environmental factors. Unlike in free-ranging Delphinidae, TSD prevalence was significantly higher in males (31.5%) than in females (12.3%). Infection was age-dependent only in females. Prevalence of very large tattoos was also higher in males (28.6%) than in females (11.1%). These data suggest that male T. truncatus are more vulnerable to TSD than females, possibly because of differences in immune response and susceptibility to captivity-related stress. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Baseline demographic information is essential for effective conservation and management strategies for most living species. The abundance of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) is poorly known, yet species conservation is considered a high priority in areas where human activities may induce population declines. This study estimated abundance for Guiana dolphins in the Cananeia estuary (25° 03' S, 47° 55' W) in southeastern Brazil using mark-recapture data and Pollock's Robust Design Model. Systematic boat-based photo-identification surveys were based on data collected in the summer and winter of 2015 and in the summer of 2016. A total of 55 capture events allowed identification of 133 different individuals. The best model indicated a population with random temporary emigration, a time-constant survival rate, and heterogeneous time-varying capture probabilities among primary periods. The temporary emigration rate (γ"= γ') was 0.05 (± 0.03). Estimated population sizes were 430 (95% CI: 410 to 451) individuals in the summer of 2015, 384 (95% CI: 366 to 403) individuals in the winter of 2015, and 414 (95% CI: 392 to 438) individuals in the summer of 2016, indicating that environmental variables among seasons may have a mild effect on the estimated size of this surveyed population. These estimates should stand as an important baseline for future comparisons. Systematic, long-term monitoring of this population is recommended, and is required to accurately assess population trends. © 2019 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are abundant in many coastal ecosystems, including the coastal Everglades. Understanding spatial and temporal variation in their abundance and group sizes is important for estimating their potential ecological importance and predicting how environmental changes (e.g. ecosystem restoration) might impact their populations. From August 2010 to June 2012, we completed a total of 67 belt transects covering a total of 2650 linear km and an area of 1232 km2. Dolphin densities varied spatially and temporally. The highest densities of dolphins were found in coastal oceans and inland bays and were lowest in rivers. Use of rivers, however, increased during the dry season while densities in other habitats remained similar across seasons. Dolphins appeared to prefer portions of bays close to mangrove-covered islands over open waters. A resighting rate of 63.6% of individuals across the 2-year study suggests that at least a portion of the population is probably resident within study regions over long time periods. The largest groups (mean 6.28, range 1-31) were found in open waters and bays despite apparently low predation pressure. Indeed, shark bite scars - likely the result of unsuccessful predation attempts - were conclusively observed on only 1% of individuals. Although further studies are warranted, the high densities of dolphins suggest that they are an important upper trophic level predator in the coastal Everglades, but their ecological importance probably varies in space and time.

ABSTRACT: The increasing gas emissions and industrial wastewater discharge of anthropogenic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) have been growing health concerns to the high trophic level marine mammals. Our previous studies showed that Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), stranded on the Pearl River Estuary region, contained exceedingly high levels of Cr in their skin-tissues. Unfortunately, the molecular toxic mechanisms on this mammal are absent, limiting our understanding of the eco-physiological impacts of Cr(VI) on dolphins. Thus, the cytotoxicity effects of Cr(VI) were analyzed on fibroblasts we isolated from the skin of S. chinensis (ScSF). This study showed that Cr(VI) markedly inhibited the viability of ScSF cells via induction of apoptosis accompanied by an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and the population of G2/M arrest or apoptotic sub-G1 phase cells, up-regulation of p53, and activation of caspase-3. Further investigation on intracellular mechanisms indicated that Cr(VI) induced depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells through regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins, resulting in decrease of the ATP level, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytosol, and the activation of caspase-9. Furthermore, antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and vitamin C displayed chemoprotective activity against Cr(VI) via suppression of p53 expression, indicating that the Cr(VI)-induced cell death may be mediated by oxidative stress. Overall, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of Cr(VI) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin skin cells, offer experimental support for the proposed protective role of antioxidants in Cr(VI)-induced toxicity, and suggest that Cr(VI) contamination is one of key health concern issues for the protection of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: On 20 January 1990, twenty-three Tursiops truncatus (Common Bottlenose Dolphin) carcasses were found scattered around the interior shoreline of East Matagorda Bay, TX. Few accounts exist to document the presence of live or dead Common Bottlenose Dolphins inside the boundaries of East Matagorda Bay before or after the die-off. We conducted a review of areal data for East Matagorda Bay and the original investigation of the January 1990 mass die-off. Information we examined included the history of natural and anthropogenic changes to the area, dolphin stranding records, small-boat visual surveys, and dolphin dorsal-fin photographic identification. Natural events preceding the discovery of the dolphin carcasses were likely factors in the mortalities; however, the timing of engineering projects that modified access points between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico may be an additional factor that contributed to the cause of this unusual mortality event. © 2018 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of life history of bottlenose dolphins in Australia is limited, with no studies comparing field and postmortem data from the same region. Carcasses of 88 opportunistically collected females (1987–2015) were studied, including eight observed for up to 23 yr before death. Ovaries were weighed and number of corpora determined grossly. Nineteen mammary glands were examined histologically. Relative age was determined using developmental features and body length, estimated age by tooth incremental lines, and physical maturity by epiphyseal fusion. Age at sexual maturation was 7.17 yr (6–>14 yr) at body lengths of 191–209 cm. Physical maturation occurred at 12–17 yr, and body lengths of 195–233 cm. An Exponential model provided the best fit for age at body length, with an asymptote at 214 cm. Combined ovary weight increased between birth and sexual maturation, with significantly more corpora in the left ovary. Corpora increased with age and appeared to persist throughout life. For mature females, 95% had ≤ 11 corpora. Number of corpora was consistent with number of calves for females with known life histories. Estimated interbirth period was about 4 yr. Three females with abnormal reproductive features were either chronically diseased and/or had high heavy metal burdens. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Coastal and freshwater cetaceans are particularly vulnerable due to their proximity to human activity, localized distributions, and small home ranges. These species include Sotalia guianensis, found in the Atlantic and Caribbean coastal areas of central and South America, and Sotalia fluviatilis, distributed in the Amazon River and tributaries. We investigated the population structure and genetic diversity of these 2 species by analyses of mtDNA control region and 8-10 microsatellite loci. MtDNA analyses revealed strong regional structuring for S. guianensis (i.e., Colombian Caribbean vs. Brazilian Coast, FST = 0.807, φST = 0.878, P > 0.001) especially north and south of the Amazon River mouth. For S. fluviatilis, population structuring was detected between the western and eastern Amazon (i.e., Colombian Amazon vs. Brazilian Amazon, FST = 0.085, φST = 0.277, P > 0.001). Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were higher for S. fluviatilis. Population differentiation was supported by analysis of the microsatellite loci (S. guianensis, northern South America vs. southern South America FST = 0.275, Jost's D = 0.476, P > 0.001; S. fluviatilis, western and eastern Amazon FST = 0.197, Jost's D = 0.364, P > 0.001). Most estimated migration rates in both species overlapped with zero, suggesting no measurable migration between most of the sampling locations. However, for S. guianensis, there was measurable migration in neighboring sampling locations. These results indicate that the small home ranges of these species may act to restrict gene flow between populations separated by relatively short distances, increasing the risk of extirpation of some localized populations in the future if existing threats are not minimized. © 2018 The American Genetic Association.

ABSTRACT: The two Sotalia species (the marine S. guianensis and the freshwater S. fluviatilis) have only recently been recognized, and both face several conservation challenges. We investigated the existence of hybridization between the two species in their possible area of sympatry in the Amazon Estuary, in northern Brazil. A fast and cheap PCR-RFLP diagnostic method using nuclear DNA was developed to discriminate between the two species, while allowing the detection of hybrids. All samples that could be identified (N = 51) were identified as S. guianensis, and no hybrids were detected. Our results, coupled with previous mitochondrial data, suggest that S. fluviatilis is not present in the Amazon delta. Thus, sympatry with S. guianensis, if it does occur, may be restricted to upstream areas of the Amazon River. Copyright © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2018.

ABSTRACT: The Arabian Gulf is one of the most heavily impacted water bodies raising serious concerns about the conservation status of many marine species. A limited coastal range and near-shore distribution make Indian Ocean humpback dolphins particularly vulnerable to mortality and traumatic injuries from heavy maritime traffic and gill-netting practices. Prior to the present study, no research had focused on the ecology of this species in the Arabian Gulf, despite the potential for human impacts. The mark-recapture method of photo-identification, undertaken during 55 boat-based surveys conducted between 2014 and 2015, was used to assess the occurrence, abundance and use of habitat of this endangered species along the coast of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (UAE). In all, 368 h and 6703 km of observation were carried out over a period of 5 months, and 54 encounters were made with humpback dolphins. The group size ranged from 1 to 24 individuals and group composition showed that 79% of the observed dolphins were adults. Abundance estimates were calculated and fitted with open population models. A review of all available data indicates that the studied population is the largest reported in the world with 701 (95% CI = 473-845) individuals. While their occurrence within Abu Dhabi near-shore waters is frequent, the survey area appears to be only a part of a much larger home range for this humpback dolphin population. The observation of multiple threats derived from anthropogenic activities increases our concerns regarding the conservation of this important dolphin population.

ABSTRACT:                              Echolocating toothed whales generally adjust click intensity and rate according to target range to ensure that echoes from targets of interest arrive before a subsequent click is produced, presumably facilitating range estimation from the delay between clicks and returning echoes. However, this click–echo–click paradigm for the dolphin biosonar is mostly based on experiments with stationary animals echolocating fixed targets at ranges below ∼120 m. Therefore, we trained two bottlenose dolphins instrumented with a sound recording tag to approach a target from ranges up to 400 m and either touch the target (subject TRO) or detect a target orientation change (subject SAY). We show that free-swimming dolphins dynamically increase interclick interval (ICI) out to target ranges of ∼100 m. TRO consistently kept ICIs above the two-way travel time (TWTT) for target ranges shorter than ∼100 m, whereas SAY switched between clicking at ICIs above and below the TWTT for target ranges down to ∼25 m. Source levels changed on average by 17log                             10                             (target range), but with considerable variation for individual slopes (4.1 standard deviations for by-trial random effects), demonstrating that dolphins do not adopt a fixed automatic gain control matched to target range. At target ranges exceeding ∼100 m, both dolphins frequently switched to click packet production in which interpacket intervals exceeded the TWTT, but ICIs were shorter than the TWTT. We conclude that the click–echo–click paradigm is not a fixed echolocation strategy in dolphins, and we demonstrate the first use of click packets for free-swimming dolphins when solving an echolocation task.                          © 2019.

ABSTRACT: Dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus are distributed in circumpolar temperate and cold temperate waters of the Southern hemisphere. In Tierra del Fuego, their presence had been considered occasional but in the last decade, they became very common along the Beagle Channel. Here, we evaluate the occurrence of dusky dolphins in Tierra del Fuego along 44 years. We also discuss the relationship of this population with their distribution in southern South America. We used three different datasets: sightings hosted in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System OBIS, incidental sightings, and shipboard sighting surveys. A total of 44 sightings of dusky dolphins in Tierra del Fuego were obtained from the three datasets from 1972 to 2016. Most individuals were recorded in the southern area of the Fuegian Archipelago. Between the 1970s and 90s their occurrence in the Beagle Channel was infrequent up to the year 2000. From 2009 to date, they were recorded each year in the Argentinean Beagle Channel waters during austral summer and fall months, suggesting at least, a seasonal resident population. Our results preclude assessing if the observed groups of dolphins in the southern portion of South America came originally from the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans populations. Molecular and spatial ecology studies (e.g., using satellite tags) could help to better understand which lineage they belong to and their spatio-temporal movements in the area. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Instrumenting animals with tags contributes additional resistive forces (weight, buoyancy, lift, and drag) that may result in increased energetic costs; however, additional metabolic expense can be moderated by adjusting behavior to maintain power output. We sought to increase hydrodynamic drag for near-surface swimming bottlenose dolphins, to investigate the metabolic effect of instrumentation. In this experiment, we investigate whether (1) metabolic rate increases systematically with hydrodynamic drag loading from tags of different sizes or (2) whether tagged individuals modulate speed, swimming distance, and/or fluking motions under increased drag loading. We detected no significant difference in oxygen consumption rates when four male dolphins performed a repeated swimming task, but measured swimming speeds that were 34% ( > 1 m s-1) slower in the highest drag condition. To further investigate this observed response, we incrementally decreased and then increased drag in six loading conditions. When drag was reduced, dolphins increased swimming speed (+1.4 m s-1; +45%) and fluking frequency (+0.28 Hz; +16%). As drag was increased, swimming speed (-0.96 m s-1; -23%) and fluking frequency (-14 Hz; 7%) decreased again. Results from computational fluid dynamics simulations indicate that the experimentally observed changes in swimming speed would have maintained the level of external drag forces experienced by the animals. Together, these results indicate that dolphins may adjust swimming speed to modulate the drag force opposing their motion during swimming, adapting their behavior to maintain a level of energy economy during locomotion. Summary Statement: Biologging and tracking tags add drag to study subjects. When wearing tags of different sizes, dolphins changed their swimming paths, speed, and movements to modulate power output and energy consumption. © 2018 van der Hoop, Fahlman, Shorter, Gabaldon, Rocho-Levine, Petrov and Moore.

ABSTRACT: The increasing availability and use of autonomous vehicles for real operational scenarios has led to the need for tools that allow human operators to interact with multiple systems effectively, taking into account their capabilities, limitations and environmental constraints. Multiple vehicles, deployed together in order to accomplish a common goal, impose a high burden on a human operator for specifying and executing coordinated behavior, particularly in mixed-initiative systems where humans are part of the control loop. In this paper, we describe experimental field tests for Dolphin, a domain-specific language that allows a single program to define the joint behaviour of multiple vehicles over a network. Using the language, it is possible to accomplish an orchestrated execution of single-vehicle tasks according to several patterns such as sequential, concurrent, or event-based program flow. With this aim, Dolphin has been integrated modularly with a software toolchain for autonomous vehicles developed by Laboratorio de Sistemas e Tecnologia Subaquatica (LSTS). The tests we describe made use of LSTS unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at open sea during the 2017 edition of Rapid Environment Picture (REP), an annual exercise jointly organised by LSTS and the Portuguese Navy. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Brunei Bay, Malaysia is currently under threat by anthropogenic activities. This study is aimed at contributing information on population size, group composition, spatial occurrence and habitat preferences of this dolphin species in the bay area. A total of 36 inDviduals (adults) of Irrawaddy dolphins were identified using dorsal fin photo match software (DARWIN) by undertaking 297.91 h of boat-based deDcated surveys (April 2013-October 2015). By using the mark-recapture open-population parameterization, the estimated population size (adult) was 33 (95% CI = 28-39) with the apparent survival rate of 0.98 (0.89-0.99, SE = 0.01). Also, the recapture rate was 0.27 (0.14-0.45, SE = 0.07) and the estimated inDvidual entry rate from super-population was 0.15 (0.10-0.22, SE = 0.03). The estimated entire population size was 41 (95% CI = 36-49) incluDng calves. The observed mean group size was 6 (SE = 0.66, range 1-18). Two hotspots were identified for dolphin occurrences near Lawas and Labuan Island at a sighting rate of 2.8-12.3 km-2. The dolphins were encountered in the bay over the entire year with no seasonal Dfferences. The observation of dolphin calves in the groups are a positive inDcator that the dolphins are breeDng successfully in the Bay area and provide hope that the population will remain stable or increase in number. The dolphins showed habitat preferences of sea depths (2 to 9.99 m), surface water temperature (29 to 31.99°C), and coastline Dstance (1.5 to 4.49 km). This study provides the first detailed information about Irrawaddy dolphins in the Brunei Bay, Malaysia, and may serve as a baseline for future comparisons. It can help researchers, conservationists, local marine park managers and policy makers to propose effective conservation and management plans in the Brunei Bay area. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. AD-like pathological lesions have been described in human and in several other animal species. In this study, we report AD-like pathological changes observed in the brain of a 40-year-old dolphin (Tursiups truncatus), boosting dolphins as a promising natural model of AD. The amyloid β (Aβ) was detected immunohistochemically as intraneuronal depositions, parenchymal accumulations and limited deposits in the wall of meningeal and parenchymal vessels. Also, neuronal tau positive labelling was noticed. This is the first report to show 'poE immunopositive reaction in dolphins. Glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astrocytes were also observed. Our findings are indicative of early AD or mild cognitive impairment pathology. So, they strongly reinforce the statement that dolphins could be a natural animal model of AD due to their lifespan, brain lesions and 'β homology with the human peptide. © British Veterinary Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: Four geographic forms of spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) occur in the eastern tropical Pacific. Two of the forms are pelagic: the eastern and whitebelly, and two are coastal: the Central American and Tres Marias spinner dolphins. Of these, only the Tres Marias form lacks recognition appropriate for developing management and conservation plans. Vertical aerial photographs of 57 spinner dolphin schools taken between 1988 and 2006 were used to examine the range of coastal forms and to characterize their calving seasons. On the basis of adult body length, spinner dolphins photographed off Guerrero, Mexico, were identified as those of the Central American form, which is north of their known range, and those photographed farther north, approximately 112 km off Nayarit, Mexico, were identified as the Tres Marias form. Calving peaked from October through March, and there was evidence that calving seasons differed among geographic forms with coastal forms calving later than pelagic forms. We present the first life history parameter estimates for the coastal forms of spinner dolphins, provide additional support for recognition of the Tres Marias form, and the first evidence of the Central American form occurring north of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico.

ABSTRACT: Odontocete cetaceans are important predators in pelagic ecosystems; however, patterns of spatial and temporal distribution in the marine ecosystem off Peru remain unknown for many species. In this study, we modeled the potential habitats for dusky (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), long-beaked common (Delphinus capensis), bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) and short-beaked common (Delphinus delphis) dolphins using maximum entropy models to two conditions: non-El Niño and El Niño 97-98. Dolphin sightings positions, fishing net hauls with potential prey data, and oceanographic variables from 24 cruises along the southeast Pacific coast of Peru (03°30′S-18°21′S) between 1997 and 2014 were used to model potential habitats of dolphins and their prey. Our modeling predicts that during non-El Niño conditions, the different dolphin species have a segregated distribution according to the physiography. Dusky and long-beaked common dolphins use mainly habitats over neritic zones segregating partially their spatial distribution while bottlenose and short-beaked common dolphins showed potential habitats mainly over the shelf-break and oceanic waters, respectively. During El Niño 97-98, this physiographic segregation was predicted to be maintained by the models although with northward retraction for bottlenose, long and short-beaked commons dolphins. Accordingly, dusky and long-beaked common dolphin potential habitat overlapped mainly with neritic potential prey species (Peruvian anchovy, Engraulis ringens; silverside, Odonthestes regia regia; red squat lobster, Pleuroncodes monodon; common squids, Doryteuthis gahi and mackerels). Bottlenose and short-beaked common dolphin habitats were predicted to overlap mainly with oceanic potential prey (mackerels; Panama lightfish, Vinciguerria lucetia; myctophids; Humboldt squids, Dosidicus gigas and euphausiids). Our results predict that dolphins use specific physiographic areas throughout the Peruvian marine ecosystem and these habitats did not drastically change during El Niño 97-98. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Represented by a nearly complete cranium with associated mandible, teeth, and vertebrae, Yaquinacetus meadi is a new genus and species of archaic homodont odontocete from the latest Oligocene–early Miocene (24–19.2 Ma) of Oregon, U.S.A. The new species is characterized by a moderately elongated rostrum bearing approximately 51 alveoli per tooth row and a knob-like, rectangular vertex. Together with Squaloziphius emlongi from the early Miocene of Washington State, Y. meadi constitutes a new odontocete family, Squaloziphiidae, fam. nov., diagnosed by a unique combination of characters, including transversely wide dorsal opening of the mesorostral groove at base of rostrum, followed posteriorly by an abrupt narrowing; thickened lateral margin of the maxilla in the antorbital region making a long and laterally concave crest; and massive, anteroposteriorly and ventrally long postglenoid process of the squamosal. Although sharing with Ziphiidae the presence of transverse premaxillary crests on the vertex, Squaloziphiidae differs in the pterygoid sinus fossa being shorter anteriorly and ventrally; the tubercule of the malleus being less reduced; and lacking a pair of enlarged alveoli for mandibular tusks. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms the sister-group relationship between S. emlongi and Y. meadi, either as late diverging stem odontocetes or as early crown odontocetes, but distant from Ziphiidae. These results confirm the northeastern Pacific as a center of diversification for several groups of archaic homodont odontocetes during the late Oligocene–early Miocene. ©, © by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: Infanticide is considered a conspicuous expression of sexual conflict amongst mammals, including bottlenose dolphins. Although reported previously in this species, confirmed cases of infanticide and associated epimeletic behaviour are very rare and their socio-behavioural context remains poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence of epimeletic and infanticide behaviours in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in Galicia, NW Spain. After describing the observed events, we include a complete description of the post-mortem examinations (where the carcasses were recovered) in order to confirm the cause of death. With evidences of blunt trauma in two of the presented cases, we confirm that the calves were intentionally killed by adult individuals. The aggressive interaction between adult individuals and the neonates together with the observed ante-mortem injuries bore a strong resemblance to the behaviours and traumatic injuries described in other cases of violent dolphin interactions in other parts of the world. The circumstances under which these infanticides occurred at our site fit the conditions proposed under the sexual selection hypothesis. The difficulties for researchers to observe this type of behaviour in the field and to find carcasses in good enough condition to determine the cause of death, emphasizes the importance of this type of study.

ABSTRACT: Phthalates are chemical additives to common consumer goods including cleaning products, cosmetics, personal care products, and plastic. Because they are not chemically bound to these products and are widely used, the potential for environmental contamination is significant. Phthalates and their metabolites have been associated with endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment, among other adverse health effects, in laboratory animals and human epidemiologic studies. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are vulnerable to environmental pollutants due to their apex position in the food chain, long life spans, and habitat overlap with developed coastal areas. The objective of this study was to quantify phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine collected from bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, during May 2016 (n = 7) and May 2017 (n = 10). Screening of nine phthalate monoester metabolites in bottlenose dolphin urine was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using methods adapted from those used for analyzing human samples. At least one phthalate metabolite was detected in 71% of the dolphins sampled across both years, with the highest concentrations detected for monoethyl phthalate (MEP; GM = 5.4 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.3–22.0 ng/ml) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP; GM = 1.9 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.1–3.2 ng/ml). These data demonstrate exposure to two of the most commonly used phthalates in commercial manufacturing, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). This study establishes methods for urinary detection of phthalate metabolites in marine mammals and provides baseline data to address a significant and growing, yet poorly understood, health threat to marine wildlife. © 2018.

ABSTRACT: The vertebrate immune response is mediated through highly adaptive, quickly evolving cell surface receptors, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC molecules bind and present a diverse array of pathogenic molecules and trigger a cascade of defenses. Use of MHC variation as a marker for population health has also evolved quickly following advances in sequencing methods. We applied a combination of traditional and next generation sequencing methodology to characterize coding (peptide binding region) and regulatory (proximal promoter) sequence variation in MHC Class II DQA and DQB genes between estuarine and coastal populations of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, an apex predator whose health status is indicative of anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem. The coding regions had 10 alleles each at DQA and DQB; the promoters had 6 and 7 alleles at DQA and DQB, respectively with variation within key regulatory motifs. Positive selection was observed for the coding regions of both genes while both coding and promoter regions exhibited geographic differences in allele composition that likely indicates diversifying selection across habitats. Most notable was the discovery of a complete duplication of a 14-bp T-box motif in the DQA promoter. Four class II promoter regions (DQA, DQB, DRA, DRB) were characterized in species from four cetacean families (Delphinidae, Monodontidae, Lipotidae, and Physeteridae) and revealed substantial promoter structural diversity across this order. Peptide binding regions may not be the only source of adaptive potential within cetacean MHC for responding to pathogenic threats. These findings are the first analysis of cetacean MHC regulatory motifs, which may divulge unique immunogenetic strategies among cetaceans and reveal how MHC transcriptional control continues to evolve. The combined MHC regulatory and coding data provide new genetic context for distinct vulnerability profiles between coastal and estuarine populations, which are key concerns for health and risk management. © 2018 Pagán et al.

ABSTRACT: Shipping noise is a widespread and relatively loud sound source among human-induced underwater sounds. The impacts of shipping noise are of special concern for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), as they inhabit shallow and nearshore habitats and are highly dependent on sound for survival. This study synthesizes our current understanding of the potential impacts of shipping noise on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins combined with knowledge on sound production and hearing of these animals and the impacts of noise on other whales and dolphins. For further protection and management of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and their habitats, shipping noise should be regulated and mitigated to modify sound from ships, to reduce overall noise levels, and to set more marine protected areas (MPAs) covering most Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin habitats with seasonal and geographical restrictions to avoid ensonification of shipping noise. The emphasis for future research should be on obtaining more baseline information about the population distribution, sound production, hearing capabilities at the population level, behavior, and stress hormones of the humpback dolphins under different noise conditions or under different noise-producing activities, and/or in high-noise areas compared with relatively quiet areas, and the noise characteristics of ships of different types, sizes and speeds. © 2018 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

ABSTRACT: Short-term measures of behavioural responses of cetaceans to tourism operations have been used in many studies to interpret and understand potential long-term impacts of biological importance. The short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the species most frequently observed in the Azores and constitutes an important component of the marine mammal tourism industry in this region. This study investigated the potential effects of tour boats on the behaviour of common dolphins off São Miguel, Azores, with particular focus on the changes in activity budget and the time required to resume activities after a tour boat interaction. Behavioural data were collected from land using a group focal-follow methodology. Markov chains were applied to analyse control and interaction sequences and to assess behavioural transition probabilities in both scenarios. In the presence of tour boats, dolphins significantly reduced the time spent foraging and increased the time engaged in other high energy activities. Dolphins also took significantly longer to resume feeding after an interaction occurred. The average bout length varied significantly between control and interaction scenarios, with foraging bouts being shorter during tour boats interactions. The results presented have management implications since feeding is a biologically critical activity. Disruption of foraging behaviour could lead to a decrease in energy intake for this population. With cetacean tourism likely to increase in the future, a precautionary approach to issuing new licences is advisable and any expansion would warrant an appropriate monitoring programme.

ABSTRACT: In order to investigate social structure, 11 years of individual photo-identification data of bottlenose dolphin were analysed. We examined the type of association indices between pairs of identified individuals; the patterns of affiliation between individual dolphins and the probabilities of association between individuals over time. Between 2001 and 2012, there were 272 encounters which resulted in the identification of 501 individuals. The discovery curve resulting from the photo-identification analysis indicated an open population with regular recruitment of new individuals. All individuals were found to be associated at an association index of <0.05. A total of 291 individuals recorded from 2004 to 2012 were used to assess the temporal pattern of the social structure. The model fit to the Standardized Lagged Association Rate (SLAR) that best described the studied bottlenose dolphin population was 'casual acquaintances', and the analysis of associations over time showed a decreasing SLAR curve that falls until reaching the null rate, confirming random associations. The decline of the SLAR curve after ~500 days (1.4 years) suggests disassociation over that time period which can be explained by demographic events such as mortality or emigration. In an open ocean habitat like Madeira this is not unexpected, as there are neither geographic boundaries nor enclosed environments. This population presented a dynamic and fluctuating social structure, where groups change in size and composition. In future conservation efforts this population should be considered as one large community, where individuals associate, disassociate and reassociate with each other over time.

ABSTRACT: Citizen science projects are an advantageous method to carry out research in the marine environmental field, especially concerning high mobile and often elusive species like cetaceans, allowing the collection of data in wide spatial-temporal scale. This project aims to validate the feasibility and accuracy of cetacean monitoring program through the citizen science approach and to test the efficiency of this method to large scale study area. In this work data obtained by researchers monitoring were compared with data coming from citizen, which followed specifically developed protocol. Data collected were used to investigate the presence and distribution of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Sicilian Channel and to evaluate the contribution of citizen scientist to improve knowledge about species, in this case for bottlenose dolphin a vulnerable species listed in the Annex II of Habitat Directive (92/43 CE). The results show that citizen dataset contributes to increase the distribution map of the 22% more than only research data were considered. Citizen science programme results useful to gain information in small areas not monitored by scientific programs, such as in this study, and they would be very useful if applied at large-scale. The promotion of citizen science programs in specified small areas could be helpful to cover unmonitored zones, to gain preliminary results and bridge the gap of knowledge about species occurrence and distribution. For this reason, citizen support might help competent authorities to answer to the environmental policies as Habitat Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This study is a demonstration of how citizen can encourage scientists to start long-term research project in not regularly monitored areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: A bipolar, single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device is capable of recording ECGs with an integrated smartphone application. To determine the utility of this device, phone-based ECGs (pECG) were compared with standard six-lead ECGs (sECG) in four female Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at the National Aquarium. Study animals were trained to haul out onto a dry deck in ventral recumbency and allow simultaneous 30-sec ECG acquisition using the two devices. The pECG device was held against the thoracic wall caudal to the left axilla. The sECGs were recorded in the frontal plane. Instantaneous heart rates were obtained from identical QRS complexes on both ECGs. Three boarded cardiologists independently evaluated the rhythm and the polarity of the QRS depolarization for each recording and the results were compared. The mean heart rate was 80 beats/min (range 62-92 beats/min) and 80 beats/min (range 60-92 beats/min) for the pECG and sECGs, respectively. All four dolphins displayed sinus respiratory arrhythmia, and one animal had occasional atrial premature contractions. Rhythm diagnosis and QRS polarity were identical for the pECG and sECG. Dolphin vocalizations created artifacts on the pECG that were not present on the sECG, so pECGs had to be acquired without vocalization. The pECG appears to be an accurate and useful method to monitor the heart rate in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. This system is inexpensive and portable, making it valuable for health examinations, transport monitoring, and stranding responses. © 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The present study describes the isolation of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from respiratory tract of 2 dolphins of different origin, a stranded juvenile Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) and a captive born common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) calf, which died in the same institution at 1-month distance from the other. A complete microbiological and genetic investigation confirmed the presence of MRSA clone-complex 8, sequence type (ST) 8, spa-type t008 in both individuals. This strain differs from the one previously reported in walruses and dolphins and has never been described in dolphins before, but it is randomly isolated from Italian human patients. Vertical transmission of the infection may also occurs in other species and considering the description and location of the pathological lesions, this seems to be the most likely route of transmission implied in the young bottlenose dolphin. Staphylococcus aureus is known as an opportunistic agent, usually secondary to other pathogens, but its multiple antibiotic resistance and its zoonotic implications suggest a thorough and strict application of animal management hygiene protocols. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

ABSTRACT: Habitat use and site fidelity in coastal dolphins can vary in space and time, and are important components in conservation planning and predicting the impacts of environmental change. Little is known of long-term patterns of habitat use and site fidelity in threatened tropical delphinids. Here, we investigate trends in habitat use and site fidelity of Australian humpback dolphins Sousa sahulensis in Moreton Bay, a near-urban embayment in Queensland, Australia, using spatially referenced sightings from systematic surveys and government datasets. Data from 1992 to 2016 were assigned to 3 time periods with similar spatial coverage and compared using ecological niche and kernel models. We also used behavioural data collected from 2014 to 2016 to investigate the potential ecological function underpinning recent habitat preferences. A long-term fidelity and consistency in habitat use was evident at an industrialised port at the mouth of the Brisbane River, but patterns of habitat use were more dynamic elsewhere. Models of spatial patterns of behaviour suggested that areas used consistently were mostly foraging habitats. A marked shift in habitat use away from the Northwestern side of Moreton Bay was evident after 1999, which we suggest was due to a decline in habitat integrity exacerbated by periodic floods. Our results imply that the optimal conservation strategy for the species would be to focus on areas that are long-term core habitats, whilst safeguarding against environmental change by maintaining habitat integrity across the broader area delineated by their ecological niche. © Inter-Research and the Department of Environment and Science on behalf of the Queensland Government 2018.

ABSTRACT: Aims: This study was conducted to assess the presence and extent of differences in the gut microbiota of common bottlenose dolphins depending on rearing facilities. Methods and Results: Faecal samples were collected from 16 common bottlenose dolphins at three aquaria in Japan. After extracting DNA from the faeces, the V3–V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. The constituent phyla of the gut microbiota were similar among aquaria; however, the most dominant phylum differed depending on the facility, and the compositions of microbiota were remarkably varied at the family level among aquaria. The alpha diversity indices tended to differ among aquaria. Some bacterial families observed in terrestrial mammalian carnivores or carnivorous fish were detected, as well as several bacterial species suspected of being pathogenic in dolphins. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that captive environmental conditions including prey and housing types may contribute to differences in the gut microbiota of the dolphins. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study revealing the differences in gut microbiota of captive dolphins among facilities. Our findings will provide valuable information for improving the health management of dolphins. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology

ABSTRACT: Although opportunistic data collected from wildlife ecotours can provide useful information on marine mammal distribution and behavior, concerns exist about whether resultant analyses have diminished accuracy due to spatial bias. To address these concerns, this study compared common bot-tlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) habitat use results derived from standardized boat-based pho-tographic-identification surveys and opportunistic photographic-identification surveys conducted during wildlife ecotours in Roanoke Sound, North Carolina. The main objectives of this study were to (1) identify areas of importance to dolphins, (2) identify activities (feed, mill, social, and travel) most often observed in these areas, and (3) determine the consistency of habitat use results between standardized and opportunistic surveys. Standardized survey hot spots for feeding and travel were located in southern Roanoke Sound according to the hot spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) spatial statistic. Conversely, opportunistic survey hot spots for feeding and travel were detected in central Roanoke Sound near the wildlife ecotour launch site. Opportunistic survey effort was concentrated around the ecotour launch site which introduced spatial bias by overestimating dolphin density in this area. These hot spot location differences between survey methods indicate that opportunistic survey results are affected by spatial bias which can lead to inaccurate conclusions about dolphin habitat use. Hot spot results of standardized data without survey effort supported the conclusion that spatial bias affected opportunistic habitat use results. This study provides a direct comparison of standardized and opportunistic datasets and demonstrates the importance of controlling for survey effort when examining marine mammal distribution and habitat use. © 2019 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Odontocetes modulate the rhythm of their echolocation clicks to draw information about their environment. When they approach preys to capture, they speed up their emissions to increase the sampling rate of “distant touch” and improve information update. This global acceleration turns into a “terminal buzz” also described in bats, which is a click train with drastic increase in rate, just as reaching the prey. This study documents and analyses under human care bottlenose dolphins’ echolocation activity, when approaching non-alimentary targets. Four dolphins’ locomotor and clicking behaviours were recorded during training sessions, when sent to immersed objects pointed by their trainers. Results illustrate that these dolphins profusely use echolocation towards immersed non-alimentary objects. They accelerate click emission when approaching the target, thus displaying a classical terminal buzz. However, their terminal buzz slackens off within a quarter of second before the end of click train. Typically, they decelerate to stop clicking just before they touch the object using their rostrum lower tip. They do not emit clicks as the contact lasts. In conclusion, when exploring inert objects, bottlenose dolphins under human accelerate clicking like other odontocetes or bats approaching preys. Bottlenose dolphins’ particular slackening-off profile at the end of the buzz shows that they anticipate the moment of direct contact, and they stop just as real touch relays distant touch of the object. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A key step in the evolutionary history of Odontoceti (echolocating toothed cetaceans) is the transition from the ancestral heterodont condition – characterized by the presence of double-rooted cheek teeth bearing accessory denticles – to the homodont dentition displayed by most extant odontocete species. During the last few decades, new finds and the reassessment of specimens in collections revealed an increased morphological disparity amongst the Oligo–Miocene heterodont odontocetes. Based on a partly articulated skeleton from late Early Miocene (Burdigalian, 18.8–18.0 Ma) beds of the Chilcatay Formation (Pisco Basin, Peru), we describe a new genus and species of heterodont odontocete, Inticetus vertizi, in the new family Inticetidae. This large dolphin is characterized by, amongst other things, a long and robust rostrum bearing at least 18 teeth per quadrant; the absence of procumbent anterior teeth; many large, broad-based accessory denticles in double-rooted posterior cheek teeth; a reduced ornament of dental crowns; the styliform process of the jugal being markedly robust; a large fovea epitubaria on the periotic, with a correspondingly voluminous accessory ossicle of the tympanic bulla; and a shortened tuberculum of the malleus. Phylogenetic analyses (with and without molecular constraint; with and without down-weighting of homoplastic characters) yielded contrasting results, with Inticetus falling either as a stem Odontoceti or as an early branching member of a large Platanistoidea clade. With its large size, robust rostrum and unusual dental morphology, and the absence of conspicuous tooth wear, Inticetus increases the morphological and ecological disparity of Late Oligocene–Early Miocene heterodont odontocetes. Finally, this new taxon calls for caution when attempting to identify isolated cetacean cheek teeth, even at the suborder level. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5B306B49-EB1B-42F9-B755-B0B05B4F938F. © 2017, © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2017.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins are excellent bioindicators of ocean ecosystem health for three reasons: (a) as long-lived apex predators they accumulate biotoxins and contaminants; (b) they are visible, routinely appearing at the water's surface in coastal areas, often coming into close contact with humans; and, (c) they exhibit a range of pathogenic lesions attributable to environmental degradation. In this study, we analyzed tattoo-like skin lesions in a population of Tursiops aduncus studied for 30+ years in Shark Bay, Australia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We provide important baseline data by documenting epidemiological patterns of tattoo-like skin lesions in a healthy, free-ranging population that builds on the previous data of tattoo skin disease (TSD) derived from free ranging, stranded, and dead dolphins. Individual dolphins were classified as symptomatic with tattoo-like skin disease if at least one photograph showed a lesion similar to TSD. The average age of infection was 26.6 months (±34.8 months) with the symptomatic period lasting 137 ± 29.8 days. Overall prevalence of tattoo-like skin disease in the population was 19.4%. Age, but not sex, was significant, with yearlings (1–2 years) exhibiting tattoo-like lesions more than younger and older calves. Tattoo-like lesions were rare among juvenile and adult dolphins (N = 68 calves, 4 juveniles, and 3 adults). We hypothesize that the lower prevalence in youngest calves (<1 year) is due to maternal immunity, while older individuals (>2 years) have infection-acquired immunity, as reported for other small cetaceans. The low prevalence of tattoo-like lesions in Shark Bay compared to other populations with poxvirus is consistent with reproductive and demographic viability analyses. Furthermore, by documenting the demography of the disease, we can monitor changes in the prevalence of tattoo-like lesions as a sentinel indicator of ecosystem health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The discoveries of marine mammal scientists over the last 50 years have made it clear that whales and dolphins demonstrate advanced intellectual and emotional traits once believed to be unique to humans. Sadly, discussions of cetacean captivity are regularly marked by unsophisticated approaches to ethics. Senior scientists regularly fail to demonstrate even the most rudimentary skills of ethical analysis. As a result, most discussions of cetacean captivity in the marine mammal community are intellectually +weak—marked by the combination of formal and informal logical fallacies and a flawed understanding of such key concepts as “consciousness,” “personal identity,” “self-awareness,” “moral standing,” “moral rights,” “personhood,” and “flourishing.” Not surprisingly, similar weaknesses are evident in the arguments offered by representatives of businesses that profit from cetacean captivity. A fundamental problem regarding cetacean captivity, then, is blindness to the ethical significance of scientific facts already known. This essay argues that a proper understanding of the problem of cetacean captivity lies in an interdisciplinary and multi-faceted approach that combines both scientific and philosophical methodologies. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: An extended period of parental care is fundamental for survival of cetacean offspring. Although qualitative descriptions of parental care and mother-calf spatial relationships are available for several species, studies using a quantitative approach throughout development of offspring are scarce. Here, we analyzed how strategies of parental care occur during the ontogeny of the Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis, in the Cananéia estuarine system, São Paulo, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that both the strategy and frequency of parental care vary according to the development of the offspring and assessed whether such changes are associated with the life stage of the calves. The frequency of parental care did not decrease according to the age of the calves. However, parental care strategies directed at infants were more diversified than those directed at neonates and juveniles. Increasing maternal-calf separation can expose older calves to new and risky situations and may demand different strategies of care. We conclude that there is a shift in the strategy adopted by the S. guianensis mothers according to the requirements of each age class, with parental care being dispensed until calves become fully independent. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and ISPA.

ABSTRACT: The Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) is an endemic species of the tropical-temperate Atlantic Ocean with widespread distribution. Although this species has been the subject of a large number of studies throughout its range, it remains in the “data deficient” category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Chemical pollution by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been listed as one of the major threats to this species, however, there is no information on a wide scale. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the contamination status of spotted dolphins on the metapopulation level as well as determine spatial and temporal variations in POP concentrations and bio-accumulation. A total of 115 blubber samples collected from a large part of the Atlantic basin were analysed for PCBs, DDTs, PBDEs, chlordanes, HCB and mirex. Although PCBs and DDTs were the predominant compounds in all areas, inter-location differences in POP concentrations were observed. Dolphins found at São Paulo, southeastern coast of Brazil, had the highest PCB concentrations (median: 10.5 μg/g lw) and Canary Islands dolphins had the highest DDT concentrations (median: 5.13 μg/g lw). Differences in PCB patterns among locations were also observed. Dolphins from the Azores and São Paulo demonstrated a similar pattern, with relatively highly contributions of tetra- (6.8 and 5.2%, respectively) and penta-CBs (25.6 and 23.8%, respectively) and lower contributions of hepta-CBs (20.8 and 23.5%, respectively) in comparison to other areas. Moreover, the sex of the animals and the year in which sampling or capture occurred exerted an important influence on the majority of the POPs analysed. Comparisons with toxicity thresholds available in the literature reveal that the São Paulo and Canary Island dolphins are the most vulnerable populations and should be considered in future conservation and management programs for the Atlantic spotted dolphin. The assessment of POP contamination patterns in Stenella frontalis revealed important differences in concentrations among different locations of the Atlantic Ocean. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens Gill, 1865) is one of the most abundant, widely distributed delphinids in the North Pacific Ocean, whose existence is threatened by fisheries and environmental contamination. Herein, we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of L. obliquidens. The 16,392-bp sequenced genome exhibited typical cetacean mitochondrial gene arrangement, consisted of the typical set of 37 genes, one replication origin, and a D-loop. As expected, the genome displayed the highest similarity with that of Cephalorhynchus heavisidii and was distinct from that of L. albirostris. Multigene phylogeny also revealed that L. obliquidens was closely related to C. heavisidii, thus suggesting that the genus Lagenorhynchus is polyphyletic, in accordance with the results of recent molecular phylogenetic studies. The results provide information fundamental for genetic and conservation studies for L. obliquidens. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) co-occur in Golfo Dulce, a fjord-like embayment located in the southern Pacific coast of Costa Rica. We evaluated if spatial overlap by these dolphin species is associated with similar environmental requirements. Presence-only models based on niche theory were constructed by contrasting a set of spatial locations with the responses of the target species to abiotic ecogeographical variables (EGVs: depth, slope, distance to rivers, distance to 200 m isobath, mean sea surface temperature, and variation in sea surface temperature). Models were cross-validated with levels of discrimination that ranged from acceptable to excellent based on the area under the curve assessment (T.Truncatus, rainy season: 0.76, dry season: 0.83; S. attenuata, rainy season: 0.84, dry season: 0.89). Both dolphin species occur in Golfo Dulce year-round; the lack of seasonality documented previously was supported by the models. Species distribution models showed no spatial overlap, with differences in EGVs affecting their distribution (T.Truncatus: distance to river + distance to 200 m isobath, S. attenuata: depth + sea surface temperature). We argue that the coexistence of both predators in Golfo Dulce is linked to habitat heterogeneity, where critical habitats are spatially differentiated. The lack of fine-scale spatial overlap, along with influential abiotic variables, highlights a process of coexistence for dolphins that are sympatric at the scale of Golfo Dulce, but within the Gulf there is fine-scale allopatry. © 2018 American Society of Mammalogists, www.mammalogy.org.

ABSTRACT: Biphonation, the simultaneous production of two sounds by a single animal, is found in the vocalizations of a range of mammalian species. Its prevalence suggests it plays an important role in acoustic communication. Concurrent vocal and behavioural recordings were made of Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) off Bimini, The Bahamas. The occurrence of two types of biphonal signals is reported: burst-pulse whistles with combined tonal and burst-pulse elements, and bitonal whistles. Biphonal whistles are rarely described in reports of dolphin acoustic repertoires, but were common in these dolphins: of all whistles analysed (n = 1211), 26.84% were burst-pulse whistles and 4.71% were bitonal whistles. A subset of whistles (n = 397) were attributed to dolphins of specific age classes, and used to compare prevalence of biphonation across age. Biphonation occurred in 61.54% of sexually mature and 48.32% of sexually immature dolphins’ whistles. Sexually immature dolphins emitted more burst-pulse whistles than older dolphins: 44.13% of sexually immature dolphins’ whistles were burst-pulse whistles, while 15.38% of adult whistles were burst-pulse whistles. Bitonal whistle production was more prevalent in sexually mature dolphins: 41.03% of adult whistles were bitonal, while only 4.19% of sexually immature dolphins’ whistles were bitonal. The prevalence of a biphonal component in specific repeated, stereotyped whistle contours suggests that these acoustic features could be important components of contact calls, or signature whistles. The biphonal components of spotted dolphin whistles may serve to convey additional information as to identity, age or other factors to conspecifics. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Synchronous breathing may be a useful proxy for studying other, and perhaps more complex, aspects of cetacean behavior. Here we describe a study conducted in Babitonga Bay, southern Brazil, where we investigated the synchrony of breathing in two small populations of franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) and Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis). The bay is affected by different sources of anthropogenic disturbances, such as boat activity and point-source pollution. We assumed breathing synchrony to be the inverse of the time between breathing surfacing displays of dolphins within a swimming pair, which we refer to as lag. The relationship between lag and anthropogenic and animal-related variables was evaluated with generalized additive models. For franciscana dolphins, breathing synchrony was only positively related to the proximity between animals. Breathing synchrony in Guiana dolphins was positively related to both the proximity between animals and to group size, and varied significantly depending on the research boat used. Proximal characteristics (i.e., of individuals or of the group) of these dolphin species seem to be more related to the synchronization in breathing than are the environmental variables assessed here. Results presented expand the current knowledge of these two dolphin species and provide general insights into the breathing synchrony for cetaceans. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins serve as sentinels for the health of their coastal environments as they are susceptible to health impacts from anthropogenic inputs through both direct exposure and food web magnification. Remote biopsy samples have been widely used to reveal contaminant burdens in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins, but do not address the health consequences of this exposure. To gain insight into whether remote biopsies can also identify health impacts associated with contaminant burdens, we employed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to interrogate the transcriptomes of remote skin biopsies from 116 bottlenose dolphins from the northern Gulf of Mexico and southeastern U.S. Atlantic coasts. Gene expression was analyzed using principal component analysis, differential expression testing, and gene co-expression networks, and the results correlated to season, location, and contaminant burden. Season had a significant impact, with over 60% of genes differentially expressed between spring/summer and winter months. Geographic location exhibited lesser effects on the transcriptome, with 23.5% of genes differentially expressed between the northern Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Atlantic locations. Despite a large overlap between the seasonal and geographical gene sets, the pathways altered in the observed gene expression profiles were somewhat distinct. Co-regulated gene modules and differential expression analysis both identified epidermal development and cellular architecture pathways to be expressed at lower levels in animals from the northern Gulf of Mexico. Although contaminant burdens measured were not significantly different between regions, some correlation with contaminant loads in individuals was observed among co-expressed gene modules, but these did not include classical detoxification pathways. Instead, this study identified other, possibly downstream pathways, including those involved in cellular architecture, immune response, and oxidative stress, that may prove to be contaminant responsive markers in bottlenose dolphin skin. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Reproductive senescence is evident across many mammalian species. An emerging perspective considers components of reproductive senescence as evolutionarily distinct phenomena: fertility senescence and maternal-effect senescence. While fertility senescence is regarded as the ageing of reproductive physiology, maternal-effect senescence pertains to the declining capacity to provision and rear surviving offspring due to age. Both contribute to reproductive failure in utero making it difficult to differentiate between the two prenatally in the wild. We investigated both components in a long-lived mammal with prolonged maternal care through three parameters: calf survival, interbirth interval (IBI) and lactation period. We provide clear evidence for reproductive senescence in a wild population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) using 34+ years of longitudinal data on 229 adult females and 562 calves. Calf survival decreased with maternal age, and calves with older mothers had lower survival than predicted by birth order, suggesting maternal-effect senescence. Both lactation period and IBIs increased with maternal age, and IBIs increased regardless of calf mortality, indicating interactions between fertility and maternal-effect senescence. Of calves that survived to weaning, last-born calves weaned later than earlier-born calves, evidence of terminal investment, a mitigating strategy given reduced reproductive value caused by either components of reproductive senescence. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The scientific study of death across animal taxa—comparative thanatology—investigates how animals respond behaviourally, physiologically and psychologically to dead conspecifics, and the processes behind such responses. Several species of cetaceans have been long known to care for, attend to, be aroused by, or show interest in dead or dying individuals. We investigated patterns and variation in cetacean responses to dead conspecifics across cetacean taxa based on a comprehensive literature review. We analysed 78 records reported between 1970 and 2016, involving 20 of the 88 extant cetacean species. We adopted a weighted comparative approach to take observation effort into account and found that odontocetes (toothed cetaceans) were much more likely than mysticetes (baleen whales) to attend to dead conspecifics. Dolphins (Delphinidae) had the greatest occurrence of attentive behaviour (92.3% of all records), with a weighed attendance index 18 times greater than the average of all other cetacean families. Two dolphin genera, Sousa and Tursiops, constituted 55.1% of all cetacean records (N = 43) and showed the highest incidence of attentive behaviour. Results of analyses intended to investigate the reasons behind these differences suggested that encephalisation may be an important predictor, consistent with the “social brain” hypothesis. Among attending individuals or groups of known sex (N = 28), the majority (75.0%) were adult females with dead calves or juveniles (possibly their own offspring, with exceptions), consistent with the strong mother-calf bond, or, in a few cases, with the bond between mothers and other females in the group. The remaining records (25.0%) involved males either showing sexual interest in a dead adult or subadult, or carrying a dead calf in the presence of females. Because an inanimate individual is potentially rescuable, responses to dead conspecifics—especially by females—can be explained at least in part by attempts to revive and protect, having a clear adaptive value. In some cases such responses are followed by apparently maladaptive behaviour such as the long-term carrying of, or standing by, a decomposed carcass, similar to observations of certain terrestrial mammals. Among the possible explanations for the observed cetacean behavioural responses to dead conspecifics are strong attachment resulting in a difficulty of “letting go”—possibly related to grieving—or perhaps individuals failing to recognise or accept that an offspring or companion has died. Our current understanding is challenged by small sample size, incomplete descriptions, and lack of information on the physiology and neural processes underpinning the observed behaviour. We provide research recommendations that would improve such understanding. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Maternal care varies across taxa from brief, minimal care to long-term, intensive care. Mammalian mothers provide extensive and energetically expensive care by definition through pregnancy and lactation, which can extend for years, resulting in behavioural trade-offs between resource acquisition and direct care. In marine environments, mammalian mothers face unique challenges, such as the inability to cache or den their offspring while diving for prey. Dolphin newborns are precocious, accomplishing shallow dives in the first few weeks of life, however, fully mature diving and breath-holding capabilities take years to develop. Consequently, mothers are faced with a trade-off between diving and foraging or remaining close to and protecting their calves at the surface. Here we examined this trade-off, specifically by investigating whether mothers change their dive durations, especially during foraging, as a function of calf age. We used a longitudinal (1988–2014) data set on wild bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, which included 27 388 dive bouts from mothers (N = 26) and calves (N = 41). Our results show that maternal diving behaviour changes in response to calf age and sex. While both male and female calves increased their dive durations with age as expected, mothers were more likely to adjust their diving behaviour to accommodate female but not male calves, especially when daughters were in close proximity. This is consistent with findings that vertical social learning is more critical for daughters than for sons, and may reflect the sex-specific foraging and social tactics of the males and females more generally. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Humans remember the past and use that information to plan future actions. Lab experiments that test memory for the location of food show that animals have a similar capability to act in anticipation of future needs, but less work has been done on animals foraging in the wild. We hypothesized that planning abilities are critical and common in breath-hold divers who adjust each dive to forage on prey varying in quality, location and predictability within constraints of limited oxygen availability. We equipped Risso’s dolphins with sound-and-motion recording tags to reveal where they focus their attention through their externally observable echolocation and how they fine tune search strategies in response to expected and observed prey distribution. The information from the dolphins was integrated with synoptic prey data obtained from echosounders on an underwater vehicle. At the start of the dives, whales adjusted their echolocation inspection ranges in ways that suggest planning to forage at a particular depth. Once entering a productive prey layer, dolphins reduced their search range comparable to the scale of patches within the layer, suggesting that they were using echolocation to select prey within the patch. On ascent, their search range increased, indicating that they decided to stop foraging within that layer and started searching for prey in shallower layers. Information about prey, learned throughout the dive, was used to plan foraging in the next dive. Our results demonstrate that planning for future dives is modulated by spatial memory derived from multi-modal prey sampling (echoic, visual and capture) during earlier dives. © 2018.

ABSTRACT: Mycotic infections in dolphins primarily affect the respiratory tract and skin. An 8-day-old, female, captive bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) showed uncoordinated swimming movements and increased breathing one hour before death. Reanimation attempts were not successful and necropsy was performed. Histological examination revealed an unilateral, pyogranulomatous and necrotizing otitis media with intralesional fungal hyphae with a morphology characteristic for Aspergillus spp.. However, as molecular analysis of fungal material obtained from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material resulted in Penicillium spp. (section Cinnamopurpurea) based on PCR results. © 2018 Schlütersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH & Co.

ABSTRACT: Delphinine dolphins arose via a recent, rapid radiation, probably within the last four million years. Although molecular phylogenies are increasingly well resolved, patterns of morphology-ecology-geography are hard to link to phylogeny or to translate into taxonomy. Such problems might be tackled through understanding the drivers of the delphinine radiation. Here, we examine delphinine historical biogeography using the phylogeny of McGowen et al. (Mol Phylogenet Evol 53:891–906, 2009) as our working hypothesis. We used the “Spatial Analysis of Vicariance” method to delimit modern distribution patterns, including disjunctions involving sister nodes in the Delphininae. The analysis identified disjunct sister nodes, allowing some interpretation of Delphininae biogeography. The Central American Seaway was probably an important gateway for early delphinids, but the succeeding “hard” barrier of the Panama Isthmus had little influence. Southern African waters form the Atlantic-Indo-Pacific gateway, which is sometimes considered a “soft” barrier because of the variation in the Benguela and Agulhas currents, in turn driven by tectonic changes and/or Pleistocene glacial and interglacial cycles. The latter cycles probably fragmented coastal habitats, allowing allopatric speciation. Geological patterns of turnover in Southern Ocean diatoms, which link to physical oceanic change, closely match the main cluster of delphinine divergences. The Eastern Pacific Barrier, and perhaps the associated Humboldt Current and equatorial “cold tongue,” affect modern distributions, but cause and effect are poorly understood. Future research should involve molecular-morphological phylogenetics for all species, subspecies, and ecomorphs. Complete distributions must be known for all taxa to understand how vicariance and dispersal shaped the distribution of delphinines. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: In this study photo-identification data were used to better understand movements, population structure and abundance of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in south-west England and surrounding waters, to inform conservation efforts. A catalogue of 485 photographic sightings of 113 individuals was compiled from ~150 common bottlenose dolphin encounters made on 87 dates between March 2007 and January 2014. From these and other data, three likely sub-populations were identified in the western English Channel, demarcated by bathymetry and distance to land: (1) south-west England - inshore Cornwall to Devon, (2) offshore English/French waters and (3) inshore France from Brittany to Normandy. Maximum abundance estimates for south-west England coastal waters, using two methods, ranged between 102 and 113 (range 87-142, 95% CL) over the period 2008-2013, likely qualifying the region as nationally important, whilst the yearly maximum was 58 in 2013. The population was centred on Cornwall, where 19 well-marked animals were considered 'probable' residents. There were no 'probable' resident well-marked individuals found to be restricted to either Devon or Dorset, with animals moving freely within coastal areas across the three counties. Movements were also detected within offshore English waters and French waters (from other studies) of the western English Channel, but no interchange has as yet been detected between the three regions, highlighting the possible separation of the populations, though sample sizes are insufficient to confirm this. Given the findings, south-west England waters should be considered as a separate management unit requiring targeted conservation efforts.

ABSTRACT: Anticipatory behaviour describes the actions taken to prepare for an upcoming event. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in captivity are known to display anticipatory behaviours before feeding sessions, but it is unknown whether they would anticipate non-alimentary events. Furthermore, there is no published information available for any species on whether the level of anticipatory behaviour is predictive of an animal's actual participation in the following event or reward: answering this question would bring us closer to understanding this behaviour and its related affective states. In this study, we used sound cues to condition dolphins to the arrival of toys in their pool or a positive Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) with a familiar trainer, and measured their anticipatory behaviour before each event. The protocol was validated since the dolphins performed significantly more anticipatory behaviour before the toys and HAI contexts than a control situation, by means of increased frequencies of surface looking and spy hopping. Furthermore, we found that dolphins showed more anticipatory behaviour before the HAI than the toys context (Linear Mixed Model with 1000 permutations, all P < 0.001). In the second part of the investigation, higher anticipatory behaviour before toy provision, HAIs, and feeding sessions was significantly correlated to higher levels of participation in the event itself (measured by time spent with humans/toys, and number of times dolphins left during feeding sessions; LMM with 1000 permutations, respectively: β = 0.216 ± 0.100 SE, P = 0.039; β = 0.274 ± 0.097 SE, P = 0.008; β = −0.169 ± 0.080 SE, P = 0.045). Our results suggest that toys and HAIs were perceived as rewarding events, and we propose that non-food human interactions play an important role in these animals’ lives. We also provide some of the first empirical evidence that anticipatory behaviour is correlated to the level of participation in the following event, supporting anticipatory behaviour as a measure of motivation, and hope that this stimulates further work regarding the use of this behaviour to assess and improve animal welfare. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Many animals display a suite of increased vigilance and/or activity responses in relation to upcoming events, termed “anticipatory behavior.” Anticipatory behavior toward positive events has been suggested as a cross-species measure of affective state as it likely reflects the balance of the reward-sensitivity system: various studies suggest that animals in poorer welfare situations show higher or excessive levels of anticipation for positive events. Another tool for evaluating animals' affective state is cognitive bias testing, and although it has been attempted, a link has not yet been made between cognitive bias and anticipatory behavior levels. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in captivity increase the performance of behaviors such as surface-looking and spy-hopping in anticipation of training sessions during which food is provided. In this study we measured anticipatory behavior frequency in bottlenose dolphins prior to positive reinforcement training sessions, and assessed whether frequency of anticipatory behavior correlated with their performance on cognitive bias tasks. We found that higher frequencies of anticipatory behavior for training sessions was significantly associated with more pessimistic judgements in cognitive bias tests, supporting previous findings linking higher reward sensitivity with negative affective states. Anticipatory behavior is an easily measured activity and could represent a welfare indicator in dolphins as well as other animals in captive environments. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment is a crucial element of promoting welfare for animals in captivity. However, enrichment programs are not always formally evaluated for their efficacy. Furthermore, there is little empirical evidence of enrichment evaluation for species of small cetaceans in zoological settings. A wide range of variables may potentially influence enrichment efficacy and how it in turn affects behavior. The purpose of this study was to determine the most preferred environmental enrichment, and method of presentation, for a species that has not been well studied in captivity, the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata). In order to determine which enrichment items and method of presentation were most effective at eliciting enrichment interaction, we systematically examined how several variables of enrichment influenced enrichment interaction. The results suggested that presenting enrichment after training sessions influenced interaction with the enrichment. The results also indicated preference for enrichment type and a specific enrichment device. Finally, factors that influenced interaction were also found to influence aberrant behavior. The results support the premise that enrichment be “redefined” for each species and each individual. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: We report the complete mitogenome of the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis. Overall structure of the 16,387 bp mitogenome was very similar to those of other delphinid species, including the ancient D. delphis individuals. Multigene phylogeny revealed that D. delphis was most closely related to Stenella coeruleoalba, and clustered well with other species within the subfamily Delphininae. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Animal social structures are shaped by external environmental factors and individual intrinsic behavioral traits. They represent a balance between the costs and benefits of group-living to maximize individual fitness. Bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, societies are fission–fusion with high variations in association strength, grouping patterns and influence of kinship on social bonds throughout the wide range of habitats where they occur. Here, the drivers of social structure in resident coastal bottlenose dolphins of the Normano-Breton Gulf (English Channel) were studied using a multidisciplinary approach combining individual monitoring (photo-identification) information, genetic and ecological data. First, the ecological segregation of the social clusters was tested. Then, the influence of kinship, sex and ecological specializations on association patterns was evaluated. Stable isotopes revealed that the social clusters had relatively distinct ecological niches. Resource partitioning among social clusters may reduce competition and may allow the area to sustain a larger resident bottlenose dolphin population. Individuals did not preferentially associate with related individuals or individuals of the same sex. However, sample size was relatively low for females and, therefore, a role of kinship in shaping association patterns could not be totally ruled out for those individuals. Instead, dolphins preferentially associated with individuals of similar ecology. The study also emphasizes that stable isotope analysis is a promising tool to investigate the link between social structure and ecological specializations, particularly in taxa that are difficult to observe in the wild. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Atlas of the Anatomy of Dolphins and Whales is a detailed, fully illustrated atlas on the anatomy and morphology of toothed and whalebone whales. The book provides basic knowledge on anatomical structures, in particular, soft tissues, and functions as a standalone reference work for dissecting rooms and labs, and for those sampling stranded and by-caught dolphins in the field. As a companion and supplement to Anatomy of Dolphins: Insights into Body Structure and Function, this atlas will be of great interest to the scientific community, including veterinarians and biologists, as a book of reference. With a modern approach to dolphin anatomy and morphology, this atlas provides the extensive knowledge necessary to practitioners and theoretical scientists such as evolutionary biologists. The conceptual clarity, precision, and comprehensive and updated display of the topographical anatomy of the body of cetaceans in the atlas support and illustrate the authors’ related work, serving as a comprehensive reference for those who are more specifically interested in the details of the anatomy and morphology of porpoises, dolphins and whales. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Although interactions between humans and wild animals have been explored in the literature, the mechanism for how such experiences influence wellbeing is an area needing further examination. This research used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore the narratives of wellbeing from eight semi-structured interviews with people who had experienced intense close encounters with dolphins. Despite idiographic differences between narratives, a common theme of Relationships and Connectedness between participants and nonhuman animals emerged. The expression of this indicates that human–dolphin experiences fulfill aspects of the human need for connection and relationships and that the experiences promote wellbeing and environmental behaviors. This is contextualized within an ongoing nature relationship and the importance of a lifelong connection with wildlife, to ensure that humans see themselves as part of the natural world. Such a dynamic is discussed within the frame of the biophilia hypothesis and the importance of human contact with nature to ensure wellbeing. The narratives reported here describe strong emotional connections, transmitted through both tangible and perceived contact with dolphins, which translate into positive senses of emotion and wellbeing. The connections described are powerful: perceptions of communion and mutual exchange become articulated through rhetoric of friendship and kinship. Importantly, it appears that dolphin encounters are signifiers of wider relationships, both with nature and people. In this case, participants are reinforcing established habits of nature connectedness, habits reflecting a lifelong involvement with nonhuman animals. How connection with wild animals as a part of nature can promote wellbeing and in turn encourage environmental behavior is discussed in the context of the contemporary need for human responsibility to ensure the protection of nature and the survival of nonhuman animal species and habitats. © 2018, © 2018 ISAZ.

ABSTRACT: Phylogeography can provide insight into the potential for speciation and identify geographic regions and evolutionary processes associated with species richness and evolutionary endemism. In the marine environment, highly mobile species sometimes show structured patterns of diversity, but the processes isolating populations and promoting differentiation are often unclear. The Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) are a striking case in point and, in particular, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.). Understanding the radiation of species in this genus is likely to provide broader inference about the processes that determine patterns of biogeography and speciation, because both fine-scale structure over a range of kilometers and relative panmixia over an oceanic range are known for Tursiops populations. In our study, novel Tursiops spp. sequences from the northwest Indian Ocean (including mitogenomes and two nuDNA loci) are included in a worldwide Tursiops spp. phylogeographic analysis. We discover a new ‘aduncus’ type lineage in the Arabian Sea (off India, Pakistan and Oman) that diverged from the Australasian lineage ∼261 Ka. Effective management of coastal dolphins in the region will need to consider this new lineage as an evolutionarily significant unit. We propose that the establishment of this lineage could have been in response to climate change during the Pleistocene and show data supporting hypotheses for multiple divergence events, including vicariance across the Indo-Pacific barrier and in the northwest Indian Ocean. These data provide valuable transferable inference on the potential mechanisms for population and species differentiation across this geographic range. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates how group size of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) changes temporally, spatially, and/or with predominant behavior at two discreet sites along the Eastern Cape coastline of South Africa: Algoa Bay and the Wild Coast. The mean group size of bottlenose dolphins was large with an average of 52 animals. Significantly larger groups were observed in Algoa Bay ((Formula presented.) = 60, range = 1–600) than off the Wild Coast ((Formula presented.) = 32.9, range = 1–250). In Algoa Bay, the mean group size increased significantly over the study period, from an average 18 animals in 2008 to 76 animals in 2016. Additionally, the largest average and maximum group sizes ever reported both in South Africa and worldwide, were recorded in Algoa Bay (maximum group size = 600). Neither season nor behavior had a significant effect on mean group size at both sites. Similarly environmental variables such as the depth and substrate type also had no influence on group size. It remains unclear which ecological drivers, such as predation risk and food availability, are leading to the large groups observed in this area, and further research on abundance and distribution of both predators and prey is necessary. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin was recently uplisted to ‘Endangered’ in the recent South African National Red List assessment. Abundance estimates are available from a number of localized study sites, but knowledge of movement patterns and population linkage between these sites is poor. A national research collaboration, the SouSA project, was established in 2016 to address this key knowledge gap. Twenty identification catalogues collected between 2000 and 2016 in 13 different locations were collated and compared. Photographs of 526 humpback dolphins (all catalogues and photos) were reduced to 337 individuals from 12 locations after data selection. Of these, 90 matches were found for 61 individuals over multiple sites, resulting in 247 uniquely, well-marked humpback dolphins identified in South Africa. Movements were observed along most of the coastline studied. Ranging distances had a median value of 120 km and varied from 30 km up to 500 km. Long-term site fidelity was also evident in the data. Dolphins ranging along the south coast of South Africa seem to form one single population at the western end of the species' global range. Current available photo-identification data suggested national abundance may be well below previous estimates of 1000 individuals, with numbers possibly closer to 500. Bearing in mind the poor conservation status of the species in the country, the development of a national Biodiversity Management Plan aimed at ensuring the long-term survival of the species in South Africa is strongly recommended. At the same time, increased research efforts are essential, particularly to allow for an in-depth assessment of population numbers and drivers of changes therein. The present study clearly indicates the importance of scientific collaboration when investigating highly mobile and endangered species. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Microcystins/Nodularins (MCs/NODs) are potent hepatotoxic cyanotoxins produced by harmful algal blooms (HABs) that occur frequently in the upper basin of the St. Johns River (SJR), Jacksonville, FL, USA. Areas downstream of bloom locations provide critical habitat for an estuarine population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Since 2010, approximately 30 of these dolphins have stranded and died within this impaired watershed; the cause of death was inconclusive for a majority of these individuals. For the current study, environmental exposure to MCs/NODs was investigated as a potential cause of dolphin mortality. Stranded dolphins from 2013 to 2017 were categorized into estuarine (n = 17) and coastal (n = 10) populations. Because estuarine dolphins inhabit areas with frequent or recurring cyanoblooms, they were considered as a comparatively high-risk group for cyanotoxin exposure in relation to coastal animals. All available liver samples from estuarine dolphins were tested regardless of stranding date, and samples from coastal individuals that stranded outside of the known cyanotoxin bloom season were assessed as controls. The MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutiric acid) technique was used to determine total (bound and free) concentrations of MCs/NODS in liver tissues. Free MCs/NODs extractions were conducted and analyzed using ELISA and LC–MS/MS on MMPB-positive samples to compare test results. MMPB testing resulted in low-level total MCs/NODs detection in some specimens. The Adda ELISA produced high test values that were not supported by concurrent LC–MS/MS analyses, indicative of false positives. Our results indicate that both estuarine and coastal dolphins are exposed to MCs/NODs, with potential toxic and immune health impacts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In mammals, the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) loops around the ligamentum arteriosum on the left side and around the subclavian artery on the right side. It is generally considered that such an asymmetric arrangement of the right and left RLN is brought about by a transformation of the aortic arches at an early stage of embryonic development. We have dissected rough-toothed dolphins and Pacific white-sided dolphins in this study. In both species, the right RLN hooked around the costocervical trunk, while the left RLN hooked around the ligamentum arteriosum. The external carotid artery, the internal carotid artery, the subclavian artery, and the costocervical trunk arose radially from the brachiocephalic trunk on the right side. The left costocervical trunk arose directly from the aortic arch. The right and left subclavian arteries ran ventral to the subclavian vein and the vagus nerve, in a similar manner to the secondary subclavian arteries in birds. These findings suggest that the replacement of the primary (or dorsal) subclavian artery by the secondary (or ventral) subclavian artery might occur at a certain embryonic stage in dolphins as well. © The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: In general, thyroid hormones (THs) stimulate cellular metabolism by inducing ATP utilization that collaterally leads to thermogenesis. However, in cetaceans, TH functions and the contribution of THs to cold adaptation are not fully understood. To investigate the role of THs in metabolism of cetaceans, seasonal changes in circulating levels in THs were investigated in the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus that were monitored under two different conditions for two years, with routine measurements of body temperature (BT), water temperature (WT) and air temperature (AT). The effects of THs on ATP synthesis were determined using cultured cells. Blood samples were collected from the species kept in different conditions at the Taiji Whale Museum located in the temperate zone and at Okinawa Expo Park in the subtropical zone. Circulating levels in total thyroxine (T4) for the dolphins at both aquaria and total 3,5,3′-tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in dolphins at Taiji were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay methods, respectively, and average concentrations were compared among seasons. To confirm the effects of THs on ATP synthesis, T3 or T4 was administrated to cultured kidney cells from the same species and cellular ATP contents were quantified at 0, 24, 48, 96 and 192 h after administration. BT of common bottlenose dolphins in each aquarium was measured for health check by chance in Taiji and every morning in Okinawa. WT in pools and AT were also measured every morning. Circulating T4 levels in autumn and winter were lower than those in spring and summer in dolphins in Taiji where WT and AT varied greatly from season to season. T4 levels showed a small difference between spring and autumn in dolphins in Okinawa with warmer WT and AT in smaller amplitude ranges than in Taiji. Total T3 level in Taiji was highest in spring and lowest in autumn as T4 levels, but not significant. The BT of dolphins in Taiji was also lower in autumn and winter compared with those in spring and summer, whereas the BT of dolphins in Okinawa fell in autumn but rose in summer, albeit to a lesser extent than in Taiji. Cellular ATP was increased by administration of both T3 and T4 compared to control. Collectively, these results suggest that the cellular metabolic activities regulated by THs may be enhanced in dolphins exposed to increasing surrounding temperature for lipolysis and reduced in dolphins exposed to colder conditions for fat accumulation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: We report records of humpback dolphins at the Montebello Islands (20°26'S, 115°33'E) approximately 80 km from the mainland coast of Western Australia. This island group is a marine protected area (MPA), with approximately half of the area a sanctuary (no take) zone managed solely for nature conservation that excludes activities such as fishing and resource extraction, activities known to impact dolphins elsewhere. The habitat varies but includes fringing coral reef and shallow, sheltered sandy lagoons mostly < 10 m water depth and not exceeding 20 m. Several opportunistic sightings and one targeted five-day survey have resulted in 28 dolphins being catalogued in the MPA through photo-identification of natural marks on the dorsal fin and are considered to be recognisable through either distinctive or subtle marks. The species was initially reported in the MPA in June 2015 and was present in summer, autumn and winter of 2017. Six calves have been observed in the MPA, with one a neonate. Given the recent listing of the species as Vulnerable on the IUCN Redlist, and increasing pressure on near-shore coastal habitat, recognising the presence of this species at offshore islands such as these, and understanding their status and connectivity is a priority for the conservation and management of the species in Western Australia. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) are chronically exposed to organic pollutants since they inhabit shallow coastal waters that are often impacted by anthropogenic activities. The aim of this review was to evaluate existing knowledge on the occurrence of organic pollutants in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, identify knowledge gaps, and offer recommendations for future research directions. We discussed the trends in the bioaccumulation of organic pollutants in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins focusing on sources, physicochemical properties, and usage patterns. Furthermore, we examined factors that influence bioaccumulation such as gender, age, dietary intake and tissue-specific distribution. Studies on bioaccumulation in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin remain scarce, despite high concentrations above 13,000 ng/g lw we previously detected for PFOS, ∑PBDE and chlorinated paraffins. The maximum concentration of organochlorines detected was 157,000 ng/g wt. Furthermore, variations in bioaccumulation were shown to be caused by factors such as usage patterns and physicochemical properties of the pollutant. However, restrictions in sampling inhibit investigations on exposure pathway and toxicity of organic pollutants in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. We proposed the use of biopsy sampling, predictive bioaccumulation and toxicity modeling, and monitoring other emerging contaminants such as microplastics and pharmaceuticals for future health risk assessment on this critically endangered marine mammal species. Organic pollutants bioaccumulate in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins primarily through dietary intake and may cause adverse health effects. Hence, the need for regular biomonitoring. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Infanticide by males is a phenomenon common in species in which the reproductive output of large numbers of females can be monopolized by a small number of males. It is thought to increase a male’s fitness, at the expense of the fitness of the infant’s parents, by bringing females into season more quickly. Infanticide by males has been recorded in just three cetacean species. We report aggressive behavior suggestive of infanticide in a fourth, the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis). We observed and photographed a series of attacks on a neonate Amazon river dolphin by a large male, with apparent protective behavior by the mother. Although infanticide was not confirmed, the forceful, aggressive behaviors were highly suggestive of infanticidal behavior and represent another important data point for comparative studies of infanticide in mammals. Amazon river dolphins may have a polygynous, polyandrous, or promiscuous mating system, the latter two of which are not the norm in species in which the reproductive output of large numbers of females are monopolized by a small number of males. However, sexual dimorphism, high rates of aggression by males, socio-sexual object-carrying displays by males, and a long interbirth interval suggest that successful male Amazon river dolphins may be able to monopolize a large proportion of mating opportunities, and it is plausible that male dolphins can improve their reproductive success by bringing females into estrous sooner by killing the offspring of other males. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and ISPA.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma gondii has been described in several marine mammals around the world including numerous species of cetaceans, yet infection and transmission mechanisms in the marine environment are not clearly defined. The Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center has been collating a database of all marine mammal stranding events along the country's national coastlines since 1993. In this study, we describe the molecular detection and characterisation of T. gondii in three common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) including one case of coinfection with herpesvirus. The animals were found stranded on the Mediterranean coast of Israel in May and November 2013. In one of the three cases, the dolphin was found alive and admitted to intensive care. To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. gondii infection of marine mammals in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. As this parasite acts as an indicator for marine pollution and marine mammal health, we believe these findings add important information regarding the state of the environment in this region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The story of change and growth, i.e., evolution, in the traditional manner, involves an epistemology of indigenous knowledge systems that admits both evolution and the divine-and therefore the human capacity for free choice-that tells us that fossil fuels are a bad choice. Steven Biko's message of “Black Consciousness” responds to the dilemma of how we belong to the species that is damaging the planetary ecosystem, amd yet how we can deny complicity by saying that reclaiming our culture enables us to see what we have done, so we can refuse complicity with the system that has divided us and take responsibility for giving birth to new life. The uncertainties of climate change can be thought through using race, class, gender, sexual orientation, indigeneity, and disability as categories of analysis. The result is an understanding that through both climate science and lived experience, we can know enough to know we ought to act on climate change. We do not need more research; we need instead an acceptance of our ignorance amid a sense of ethical responsibility. This story speaks of liberation from oppression and of climate action as deeply entangled in. © 2021 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Numerous species of marine megafauna are at risk of extinction and understanding their genetic population structure and demographic history is essential for their conservation. We used mitochondrial DNA and 18 nuclear microsatellite loci, on the largest genetic dataset compiled to date on Australian humpback dolphins (eight sampling sites, 159 samples), to assess their genetic diversity, gene flow and past demographic history along the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Levels of genetic diversity were low (mtDNA: h = 0–0.52, π = 0–0.007; nDNA: Ho = 0.27–0.41; AR = 1.7–2.4). Both mitochondrial (ΦST = 0.49, P = 0.001) and nuclear markers (FST = 0.14, P = 0.001) showed strong genetic structure among sampling sites. Four putative populations were identified, with little contemporary gene flow (m = 0.017 to 0.047) among populations. Genetic divergence follows an isolation-by-distance model (r = 0.38, P = 0.0001), with an apparent restriction in gene flow occurring at scales of 382–509 km. Estimates of contemporary effective population size were low (Ne = 11.5–31.2), with signatures of genetic bottlenecks for all putative populations about 50–150 generations ago. The current low levels of genetic diversity, gene flow, and effective population size in Australian humpback dolphins indicate the effects of historical population bottlenecks and/or founder events during the late Holocene period (~1250–3750 years ago); probably associated with sea level fall and increased intensity of El Niño Southern Oscillation-climatic events. Our results raise important conservation concerns and emphasize the vulnerability of Australian humpback dolphins to stochastic demographic, genetic and environmental processes. Conservation strategies should focus on promoting connectivity among local populations and reducing direct causes of human-related mortality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This study aims to investigate the association patterns of a small and resident population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Bahía San Antonio (Argentina), and assess any seasonal variation in view of the reported seasonal variation in the population's grouping behavior. The estimation of social differentiation (S) was 0.29 (SE = 0.08), suggesting a homogenous society. The half-weight index (HWI) averaged 0.23 (± 0.06), with evidence of long-term preferred associations. However, data showed seasonal variation in the association patterns. In winter, when large groups were reported in this population, HWI values averaged 0.30 (± 0.09) with no indication of preferred or avoided associations. However, during summer, when group size was generally small, HWI values averaged 0.14 (± 0.07), with an indication of preferred/avoided associations. This study indicates that the social structure of the bottlenose dolphins in Bahía San Antonio seems relatively homogenous and flexible over time, with the formation of a random social network at times when large aggregations are formed, and a more disconnected network made up of strongly connected components when the cost of grouping is high. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Determining discrete and demographically independent management units within wildlife populations is critical for their effective management and conservation. However, there is a lack of consensus on the most appropriate criteria to delimit such management units. A multi-disciplinary, multi-scale approach that combines tools informing in the short-term (i.e. photo-identification), with mid-term ecological tracers (stable isotopes –δ13C, δ15N and δ34S– and persistent organic pollutants –POPs–), and mid- to long-term genetic markers (microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA), was used to define management units within bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the southern Iberian Peninsula. Although genetically indistinguishable, individuals inhabiting the Strait of Gibraltar and the Gulf of Cadiz showed differences in their isotopic composition and the concentrations of certain POPs. Accordingly, the lack of photographic recaptures between the two sites pointed to the existence of at least two different ecological management units that segregate spatially and may require different conservation strategies. Different time-scale approaches can reveal different management units. The results highlighted the use of medium- and short-term approaches for properly identifying ecologically different units for effective management and conservation. Furthermore, these results have important management implications as European legislation promotes specific management plans for this species. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The co-occurrence of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the northern Gulf of Mexico cetacean Unusual Mortality Event have raised questions about the stability of inshore bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) populations throughout the region. Several factors could have contributed to the ongoing event, but little attention has been paid to the potential effects of increased search effort and reporting of strandings associated with oil spill response activities, which were widespread for an extended period. This study quantified the influence of increased search effort by estimating the number of bottlenose dolphin strandings reported by oil spill responders and comparing monthly stranding rates with and without response-related records. Results showed that response teams reported an estimated 58% of strandings during the Active Response period within the study area. Comparison of Poisson rates tests showed that when responder-influenced stranding records were removed, the monthly stranding rates from the Active Response period (May 2010 –April 2014) were similar to the Post-Removal Actions Deemed Complete period (May 2013 –March 2015) (e.g., p = 0.83 for remote areas in Louisiana). Further, analyses using the Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistic showed that when response-related stranding reports were removed from the Active Response period, significant spatial clustering of strandings (p < 0.05) was reduced by 48% in coastal Louisiana. Collectively, these results suggest that increased search effort resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response throughout remote portions of the Unusual Mortality Event geographic region had the capacity to increase reporting and recovery of marine mammal strandings to unusually high levels. To better understand how stranding data relates to actual mortality, more work is needed to quantify dolphin population size, population trends, and carcass detection rates including the role of search effort. This is vital for understanding the status of a protected species within the northern Gulf of Mexico. © 2018 Pitchford et al.

ABSTRACT: We sequenced mitochondrial genes of otter (Lontra longicaudis and Pteronura brasiliensis) and dolphin (Inia sp.) species to provide new systematics data and to test hypotheses that offer explanations as to the Amazon’s biodiversity. Four of the 11 hypotheses tested --Paleogeography (PH), Recent Lagoon (RLH), Hydrogeological Recent Change (HRCH), and Refugia (RH)-- support the evolution of these three species. As part of this comparative phylogenetic study, we also considered the degree of water dependence of each species. For the least water dependent of the three species, L. longicaudis, only HRCH and RH had an influence on genetic structure, although it was relatively minor. For the more water dependent otter species, P. brasiliensis, our analyses stressed the significance of a single PH event along with two lesser important PH events. However, its gene diversification basically occurred during the Pleistocene and our analyses did detect a relatively small influence of HRCH and RH. For the completely water dependent species, Inia, we detected two significant PH events. Its genetic structure was considerably more developed than in either otter species, although the Pleistocene was a very important period of genetic diversification for the pink river dolphins (HRCH and RLH). Each species has ancestors with different geographical origins and genomes with different capacities to colonize—making it difficult to rely on a generalized hypothesis to understand the origins of the Amazon’s extremely rich biodiversity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Brunei Bay, Malaysia is little studied. This study aimed at contributing information on how abiotic and other factors influence different aspects of their behaviour displayed at the water surface. Several behaviours, i.e. foraging, travelling, foraging behind trawler, milling and socializing were observed during boat-based line transect surveys (2013–2016). The behaviours of individuals and groups were filmed or noted, and the abiotic factors of the habitat were registered at the same time. The number of “travelling” individuals was negatively correlated with surface water salinity (p value = 0.04) and positively correlated with turbidity (p value = 0.01). Fisher’s exact test also revealed that the behaviours of dolphin groups significantly differed with the ranges of several abiotic factors, i.e. foraging behind trawler with depth (p value = 0.001), travelling with surface water salinity (p value = 0.05), travelling and foraging behind trawler with turbidity (p value = 0.04, 0.01). The results for foraging behind trawler differed significantly between the groups with calves and those without calves (χ2 test, p value = 0.04), where groups with calves were less likely to forage behind trawlers. Significant differences were observed among group sizes for travelling, milling and socializing (χ2 test, p value < 0.05), with large groups (11–20 individuals) more frequently foraging, milling and socializing, compared to smaller ones. The current study is the first behavioural observation for Irrawaddy dolphins in Brunei Bay and these findings will help researchers, conservationists, local marine park managers and policy makers in developing effective conservation and management plans for the area. © 2018, Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Given the common physical overlapping between coastal developments and important marine mammal habitats, there is a need to identify potentially important foraging grounds for dolphins when informing marine spatial planning and management of underwater noise. Hydrophones were deployed at four locations either side of the mainland China-Hong Kong Special Administrative Region border to monitor the presence of soniferous fishes; a key prey item for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Five distinct chorus-types were identified; each showing spatiotemporal variability. Each chorus-type was assumed to represent a separate species. Chorus-type diversity also differed between sites, with SP4 and SP5 types only being detected within Hong Kong waters where bottom trawling is illegal. Chorus-type SP1 was only detected at the recording sites in mainland Chinese waters. Call rates and chorus duration were highest during the spring and summer months. Given these dolphins show a predator-prey relationship, these data provide new information on the local fish communities at a much finer-scale than fish landing records and a baseline of fish activity in an environment that is challenging to explore. Overlaid with acoustic detections of foraging dolphins, these data form a basis for identifying potentially important foraging habitats that should be afforded the highest priority for protection. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

ABSTRACT: The auditory brainstem response to a dolphin’s own emitted biosonar click can be measured by averaging epochs of the instantaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) that are time-locked to the emitted click. In this study, averaged EEGs were measured using surface electrodes placed on the head in six different configurations while dolphins performed an echolocation task. Simultaneously, biosonar click emissions were measured using contact hydrophones on the melon and a hydrophone in the farfield. The averaged EEGs revealed an electrophysiological potential (the pre-auditory wave, PAW) that preceded the production of each biosonar click. The largest PAW amplitudes occurred with the non-inverting electrode just right of the midline—the apparent side of biosonar click generation—and posterior of the blowhole. Although the source of the PAW is unknown, the temporal and spatial properties rule out an auditory source. The PAW may be a neural or myogenic potential associated with click production; however, it is not known if muscles within the dolphin nasal system can be actuated at the high rates reported for dolphin click production, or if sufficiently coordinated and fast motor endplates of nasal muscles exist to produce a PAW detectable with surface electrodes. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Abundance, density, daily variation in group size, activity and habitat use of the striped dolphin in the Gulf of Taranto (northern Ionian Sea, central Mediterranean Sea) were investigated using data from sightings collected between April 2009 and December 2016 during standardized vessel-based surveys. Density and abundance were estimated in the survey area by means of conventional distance sampling, resulting in 0.97 specimens/km2 (CV = 5.77%; 95% CI = 0.86–1.08 specimens/km2) and 615 specimens (CV = 5.77%; 95% CI = 549–689 specimens), respectively. Group size data were analysed using multivariate methods. The changes in group size, depth and percentage occurrence of activity between daily periods were investigated with non-parametric tests. The spatio-temporal distribution of the striped dolphin in each predominant activity was investigated by means of the ordinary Kriging method. Fifteen year-maps of spatial prediction were produced, allowing the identification of persistent areas. The results delineate a critical habitat of about 150 km2 in the northernmost ‘Taranto Valley’ canyon system ranging between 140 and 910 m in depth. This critical habitat was persistently and regularly used by an important estimated population of striped dolphins for their day-to-day survival and maintenance in a healthy condition. The intense human use occurring in the area highlights the need for local, national and EU management to set a comprehensive strategy. The establishment of a SPAMI (Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance) as an effective tool for the conservation of the species is suggested. The consequence of establishing a closed area could be reasonably accepted by local concurrent stakeholders. Indeed, limiting access through the establishment of this small closed area would result in the protection of a habitat acting as an ecological refuge for many other pelagic and demersal species of commercial interest, thus favouring their spill over.

ABSTRACT: Systemic steroid hormone measurements are often used in the assessment of reproductive, developmental, and stress physiology in vertebrates. In protected wildlife, such as the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), these measures can provide critical information about health and fitness to aid in effective conservation and management. Circulating steroid hormone concentrations are typically measured by immunoassays, which have imperfect specificity and are limited to the measurement of a single hormone per assay. Here we demonstrate that reverse phase solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) allows for the simultaneous, precise (<15% relative standard deviation), and accurate (between 70% and 120% recovery of spiked quantities) measurement of at least seven steroid hormones in dolphin plasma. These seven steroid hormones include three hormones that have been measured previously in bottlenose dolphin blood (progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol) and three hormones which have never been quantified in dolphin blood (17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, cortisone, and corticosterone). While 17β-estradiol was not detected endogenously, we were able to accurately and precisely measure spiked quantities estradiol. Measures from plasma were more precise (i.e., lower RSD) than serum, and thus we recommend plasma as the preferred matrix for this analytical method. In order to facilitate comparison of current and future plasma-based studies to previous serum-based studies, we characterized the relationships between hormone measurements in matched plasma and serum, and found that measurements across matrices are significantly and positively correlated. Lastly, to demonstrate potential applications of this method, we examined how steroid hormone profiles vary by pregnancy, sexual maturity, and stress status – pregnancy was associated with elevated progesterone, adult males had higher testosterone, and capture stress was associated with elevated corticosteroids. Overall, we conclude that this method will enable investigators to more thoroughly and efficiently evaluate steroid hormone homeostasis in bottlenose dolphins compared to immunoassay methods. These methods can potentially be applied to the assessment of sexual maturity/seasonality, pregnancy status, and stress in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins as well as those maintained under human care, and potentially other marine mammals. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In South Africa, the humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) has been recognized as the most endangered marine mammal, with a low abundance, a discontinuous distribution, and numerous threats. This research was initiated in 2008 to estimate the number of individual humpback dolphins in Algoa Bay, as well as studying their residency patterns and distribution. The last boat-based study on humpback dolphins, conducted 24 years ago, formed an important reference against which to compare current findings. This study reveals that since the 1990s the number of identified animals decreased from 70 to 50 individuals, and the mean group size of humpback dolphins has also decreased, from seven to three animals. Humpback dolphin behaviour was predominantly that of foraging and travelling, although the overall frequency of foraging still seems to have decreased since early 1990s. Although the species was seen almost all year round, the number of sightings per survey was lowest in January, March, and April. The number of sightings per kilometre surveyed substantially decreased from 0.018 sightings per kilometre in 2008 to 0.004 in 2011, and the number of animals per kilometre also decreased from 0.042 to 0.009. The re-sighting rates were low, ranging from one to eight times, with 52% of identified dolphins seen only once throughout the study period. Only 6% of the individuals were seen more than three times. Reduced humpback dolphin numbers and sighting rates could be indicative of the rise in anthropogenic activities, such as shipping and recreational boating, as well as a rise in pollution from vessels and urban development. Conservation strategies, such as a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species, are urgently needed in Algoa Bay, especially in the south-west part of the bay, between Cape Recife and the Port Elizabeth Harbour, where the species occurs most frequently.

ABSTRACT: The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea), a common cetacean species in India, has a diverse vocal repertoire, which to date has not been described in detail. This study focused on analyzing their whistle vocalizations. Humpback dolphins were recorded off the Sindhudurg coast of Maharashtra, India, and 2,260 whistles were analyzed for their acoustic characteristics. Whistles spanned a wide frequency range between 2.3 kHz and 33.0 kHz, with durations ranging from 0.01 s to 1.60 s. Whistles were categorized into seven contour classes based on their qualitative properties. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to quantify variability between the seven contour classes using the measured acoustic features. Based on the CART analysis, frequency gradient, minimum slope, maximum slope, beginning and ending slope accounted for most variability between whistle types. CART resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 89.5%. This study provides a detailed description of acoustic features and qualitative properties of humpback dolphin whistles from the northwestern coast of India. Further comparisons of acoustic data from Sousa populations along the Indian coast are necessary to determine possible geographic variations in whistle characteristics and whether the variations are driven by environmental or genetic factors or a combination of both. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Objective: Corneal ulceration secondary to trauma commonly affects marine mammals, often with opportunistic secondary bacterial or fungal infections. This report characterizes the combined use of auriculopalpebral and ophthalmic nerve blocks, adipose-derived stem cells, and subconjunctival injections for successful treatment of corneal trauma and infection in dolphins. Animal studied: An 11-year-old, female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) presented with bilateral diffuse corneal opacities, which progressed to keratomycosis caused by Candida albicans. Procedure: Aggressive medical management was employed, including the use of subconjunctival injections of adipose-derived stem cells, plasma, topical and oral antifungals and antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory and pain medications. Anesthetic block of the auriculopalpebral and ophthalmic nerves was employed to evaluate the corneas. Conclusion: Subconjunctival injections were employed over 52 days, followed by topical drops for 5 months. At last evaluation, there was no evidence of blepharospasm bilaterally. Only a faint superficial gray corneal opacity remained OS. A temporal paraxial corneal opacity was present OD, with receding inactive vascularization and a small amount of melanosis temporally. © 2017 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: The dermis of cetaceans is in constant contact with microbial species. Although the skin of the bottlenose dolphin provides adequate defense against most disease-causing microbes, it also provides an environment for microbial community development. Microbial community uniqueness and richness associated with bottlenose dolphin skin is a function of varying habitats and changing environmental conditions. The current study uses ribosomal DNA as a marker to identify bacteria found on the skin of coastal and offshore bottlenose dolphins off of Southern California. The unique microbial communities recovered from these dolphins suggest a greater microbial diversity on the skin of offshore ecotype bottlenose dolphins, while microbial populations associated with the coastal ecotype include species that are more closely related to each other and that suggest exposure to communities that are likely to be associated with terrestrial runoff. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: In 2015, an online survey was conducted to investigate public attitudes and perceptions toward key cetacean (whale, dolphin, and porpoise) conservation and "hot topic" issues such as legislative protection and whaling (n = 858). The vast majority of the participants in this study indicated their permanent residence was the United States (n = 577) or India (n = 251). Perceptions of participants on the conservation priority of cetacean species did not match with the factual IUCN status, where most participants assumed that the larger and more charismatic whales (blue whale, 24.01%; humpback whale, 22.14%; and killer whale, 23.43%) were more endangered or more important to conserve than the small cetacean species such as the Vaquita or Hector's dolphin. Additionally, 39.74% of participants indicated that they thought bottlenose dolphin was the most important to conserve. More members of the public highlighted non-existent (fake) species (e.g., pygmy short-fined whale, lump-headed dolphin, and majestic spotted dolphin) as being of conservation concern than certain species of actual, genuine concern. The majority of participants considered dolphins and whales to be "under protected" or only "slightly protected" (29.95%; 41.96%, respectively) and expressed that marine mammal conservation laws and policies were "very important" or "important" (47.43 and 37.88%, respectively). In addition, 86.83% of participants expressed opposition to the hunting of dolphins and whales (57.93% "strongly opposed" and 28.90% "opposed"); however, only 47.44% of participants were aware that several countries are still involved in whaling. A lack of awareness of the conservation status of whales and dolphins and continued whaling activities suggests that greater outreach to the public about the conservation status of whale and dolphin species is needed. © 2018 Naylor and Parsons.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean health may be potentially affected by anthropogenic sound. We have initiated investigations on the effect of low-frequency underwater sound on immunological gene transcript profiles of captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) using a probe-based quantitative gene expression assay. Six immunologic genes (IL-2Rα, -4, -10, -12, TNFα and IFNγ) were selected for analysis using two validated housekeeping genes (PGK1 and HPRT1) as reference genes. Twenty-four blood samples from six clinically healthy individuals and six blood samples from individuals after sound exposures were available. The gene transcript profile of sound-exposed dolphins was consistent with a stress-induced TH 2 shift profile as compared to controls. This study may lead to better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic sound on immune responses of cetaceans. © 2018 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: This study provides the first estimates of density and abundance of the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba and common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central Mediterranean Sea) and identifies the predictive variables mainly influencing their occurrence and concentration in the study area. Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) and the Delta approach on Random Forest (DaRF) methods have been applied to sightings data collected between 2009 and 2016 during standardized vessel-based surveys, providing similar outcomes. The mean value of density over the entire study area was 0.72 ± 0.26 specimens/km2 for the striped dolphin and 0.47 ± 0.09 specimens/km2 for the common bottlenose dolphin. The abundance estimated by DaRF in the Gulf of Taranto was 10080 ± 3584 specimens of S. coeruleoalba and 6580 ± 1270 specimens of T. truncatus, respectively. Eight predictive variables were selected, considering both the local physiographic features and human activities existing in the investigated area. The explanatory variables depth, distance from the coast, distance from industrial areas and distance from areas exploited by fishery seem to play a key role in influencing the spatial distribution of both species, whereas the geomorphological variables proved to be the most significant factors shaping the concentration of both dolphins. The establishment of a Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI) according the SPA/BD Protocol in the Gulf of Taranto is indicated as an effective management tool for the conservation of both dolphin populations in the Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) internalize into susceptible bacteria using specific transporters and interfere with protein synthesis and folding. To date, mammalian PrAMPs have so far been identified only in artiodactyls. Since cetaceans are co-phyletic with artiodactyls, we mined the genome of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, leading to the identification of two PrAMPs, Tur1A and Tur1B. Tur1A, which is orthologous to the bovine PrAMP Bac7, is internalized into Escherichia coli, without damaging the membranes, using the inner membrane transporters SbmA and YjiL/MdM. Furthermore, like Bac7, Tur1A also inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome and blocking the transition from the initiation to the elongation phase. By contrast, Tur1B is a poor inhibitor of protein synthesis and may utilize another mechanism of action. An X-ray structure of Tur1A bound within the ribosomal exit tunnel provides a basis to develop these peptides as novel antimicrobial agents. Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are antibacterial components of the immune system of some animals. Mardirossian et al. identified two PrAMPs in the artiodactyl Tursiops truncatus (bottlenose dolphin), Tur1A and Tur1B. Tur1A was shown to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Two near shore small cetaceans occur commonly along the Maharashtra coast, the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin and Indo Pacific finless porpoise. These cetaceans frequently interact with fisheries in this region due to overlap in space and resource use. Besides stranding records, little ecological information is available about these species from Maharashtra. We conducted 143 semistructured interviews to document local ecological knowledge and community perceptions of small cetaceans in 30 coastal fishing villages in Sindhudurg. Perceptions of finless porpoises were largely neutral, whereas humpback dolphins were negative. A classification regression tree (CART) analysis (root node error: 60%) showed that the annual cost of gear damage was an important predictor variable of humpback dolphin perceptions, followed by occupation (gear type) and age. Entanglements were reported for both species in large and small gill nets, and shore seines. Perceived net damage and catch loss due to humpback dolphins was six times greater than that of finless porpoises. However, finless porpoises were reportedly more frequently entangled in gear than humpback dolphins. We provide an insight into the perceptions of cetaceans in the local community and the fisheries-cetacean interactions that shape them. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Predator diet is expected to respond to changes in the abundance of important prey items. We investigated whether common dolphin diet has changed with changes in the pelagic fish community off the Iberian Peninsula in recent years, in particular with reference to the decline of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and the increase of Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias) and scads (Trachurus spp.), and estimated how much fish was removed by common dolphins in coastal waters of mainland Portugal. Based on analysis of stomach contents of stranded animals from 2010 to 2013 (n = 150), we related diet composition to sardine abundance, dolphin size and sex, season and region. Despite the decline in sardine stocks in recent years, sardines were the most important prey of common dolphins, as was previously reported in the 1990s, followed by chub mackerel and scads. However, small sardines have disappeared from the diet, consistent with recent poor recruitment to the stock. The relative importance of these pelagic species in the diet increased significantly with increasing dolphin length. The dietary importance of chub mackerel also varied regionally, with higher intake on the southern coast. Finally, we compared the estimated biomass of fish removed by dolphins with that taken by fisheries. We found that even with the severe quota restrictions on sardine catches, total biomass removed by fisheries was over five times greater than the estimated removal by common dolphins. Our results confirm the previously reported preference for energy-rich prey, especially sardine, suggesting that common dolphins in Portuguese waters specialise in feeding on this species. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Diving mammals have evolved a suite of physiological adaptations to manage respiratory gases during extended breath-hold dives. To test the hypothesis that offshore bottlenose dolphins have evolved physiological adaptations to improve their ability for extended deep dives and as protection for lung barotrauma, we investigated the lung function and respiratory physiology of four wild common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) near the island of Bermuda. We measured blood hematocrit (Hct, %), resting metabolic rate (RMR, l O2 · min-1), tidal volume (VT, l), respiratory frequency (fR, breaths · min-1), respiratory flow (l · min-1), and dynamic lung compliance (CL, l · cmH2O-1) in air and in water, and compared measurements with published results from coastal, shallow-diving dolphins. We found that offshore dolphins had greater Hct (56 ± 2%) compared to shallow-diving bottlenose dolphins (range: 30-49%), thus resulting in a greater O2 storage capacity and longer aerobic diving duration. Contrary to our hypothesis, the specific CL (sCL, 0.30 ± 0.12 cmH2O-1) was not different between populations. Neither the mass-specific RMR (3.0 ± 1.7 ml O2 · min-1 · kg-1) nor VT (23.0 ± 3.7 ml · kg-1) were different from coastal ecotype bottlenose dolphins, both in the wild and under managed care, suggesting that deep-diving dolphins do not have metabolic or respiratory adaptations that differ from the shallow-diving ecotypes. The lack of respiratory adaptations for deep diving further support the recently developed hypothesis that gas management in cetaceans is not entirely passive but governed by alteration in the ventilation-perfusion matching, which allows for selective gas exchange to protect against diving related problems such as decompression sickness. © 2018 Fahlman, McHugh, Allen, Barleycorn, Allen, Sweeney, Stone, Faulkner Trainor, Bedford, Moore, Jensen and Wells.

ABSTRACT: According to theory, individuals forage in ways that maximize net energy intake. Distinct foraging strategies may emerge within a population in response to heterogeneous resources, competition and learning, among other drivers. We assessed individual variation in, and ecological consequences of, an unusual, specialized foraging tactic between animals and humans. In southern Brazil, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, herd fish schools towards artisanal fishermen, who cast nets in response to behavioural cues from the dolphins. This apparent cooperative tactic likely involves costs as well as benefits for both interacting parties, but such trade-offs remain poorly understood, especially for dolphins. We show that individual dolphins vary markedly in the frequency with which they interact with fishermen, and that this foraging variation is linked to ranging behaviour. Not all individual dolphins interact with fishermen; those that routinely do so concentrate around the limited interaction sites and have smaller home ranges than independent foragers. This suggests that foraging with fishermen increases foraging success and reduces search costs (i.e. foraging range). Competition for interaction sites may offset such benefits, since some individuals often forage at the high-quality sites while others forage at low-quality sites. Taken together, our findings suggest that two alternative tactics emerge in the population from trade-offs involving food access, foraging area, learning techniques and competition: dolphins either forage by themselves over larger areas on unpredictable resource patches (passing fish schools), or learn to interact with fishermen to access and compete for more predictable resource patches (interaction sites). By revealing some of the ecological drivers of this remarkable human–animal interaction, our study contributes two broader insights. First, specialized foraging can have ranging consequences for individuals and so structure the population spatially; second, interspecific cooperation may be founded upon intraspecific competition. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), including those impacted by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, inhabit the coastal and estuarine waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). In response to the spill, dolphin health assessments conducted in Barataria Bay, Louisiana – a site that experienced heavy and prolonged oiling – uncovered a high prevalence of health abnormalities and individuals in poor body condition. Although the health effects observed were suggestive of petroleum toxicity, a lack of pre-spill information regarding dolphin health raises the possibility that other environmental factors may have contributed to the adverse health of dolphins in this oil-impacted area. To assess how exposure to other environmental pollutants may affect the health of northern GoM dolphin populations impacted by the DWH oil spill, a suite of 69 persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorine pesticides, was determined in blood and a subset of blubber samples collected during health assessments of 145 bottlenose dolphins at three GoM sites: two oil impacted sites - Barataria Bay, LA (BB), and Mississippi Sound, MS (MS) and an unimpacted reference site - Sarasota Bay, FL (SB). Overall, levels of POPs at all three sites appeared comparable or lower than concentrations previously reported for coastal bottlenose dolphin populations outside of the northern GoM. POP levels measured in BB dolphins were also comparable or lower than those measured at the unimpacted reference site (SB) within the northern GoM. Additionally, the relationship between blubber and blood contaminant levels in a smaller subset of BB and SB suggests that BB animals were not experiencing elevated blood-contaminant concentrations as a result of their poor body condition. Cumulatively, these results suggest that background levels of POPs measured are unlikely to produce the health abnormalities previously reported for BB dolphins. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans were used to analyse, respectively, the soft tissues and the bones of the heads of four common dolphins and three harbour porpoises. This imaging study was completed by an examination of anatomical sections performed on two odontocete heads (a subadult common dolphin and a subadult harbour porpoise). The three complementary approaches allowed to illustrate anatomical differences in the echolocation systems of the common dolphin and the harbour porpoise. We captured images confirming strong differences of symmetry of the melon and of its connexions to the MLDB (Monkeys Lips/Dorsal Bursae) between the common dolphin and the harbour porpoise. The melon of the common dolphin is asymmetrically directly connected to the right bursae cantantes at its right side, whereas the melon of the harbour porpoise is symmetrical, and separated from the two bursae cantantes by a set of connective tissues. Another striking difference comes from the bursae cantantes themselves, less deeply located in the head of the common dolphin than in the harbour porpoise. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Infections caused by the fungal pathogen Lacazia loboi were first reported in 1931 by Jorge de Oliveira Lobo in a human with granulomatous skin lesions in Pernambuco, Brazil. Early histopathological and serological analyses found morphological similarities and cross-reactive antigens with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. In 1971, veterinarians working with dolphins in Florida, USA, reported granulomatous skin lesions in a dolphin, similar to that in human lacaziosis. Based on histopathological findings, L. loboi was initially believed to be also the etiologic agent of cutaneous disease in dolphins. Ever since, cutaneous granulomas have been reported in different dolphin species around the coast of Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Recently, using molecular biology approaches, some investigators stated that the DNA sequences extracted from cases of cutaneous granulomas in dolphins were closely related to those of P. brasiliensis. This chapter deals with the history, taxonomy, and other features of L. loboi in humans and the unculturable P. brasiliensis var. ceti type affecting the skin of dolphins. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: Phenotypic changes in the mammalian mandible can occur at different spatial and temporal scales. We investigated mandibular size and shape variation in three extant closely related dolphins (Cetacea, Odontoceti): Tursiops truncatus, Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus delphis in order to test the hypothesis that similar phenotypic changes occur across the same geographical gradient. Our data included 219 specimens representative of the following geographic locations: the Mediterranean Sea, the eastern north Atlantic and the North Sea. Each mandibula was photographed laterally and spatial positioning of eight homologous 2D landmarks was recorded. After applying generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA), intraspecific variation was first investigated between sexes and among populations to allow further pooling of samples. Size and shape differences among populations and species were investigated through multivariate ordination techniques (PCA), Procrustes ANOVA and allometric analyses. In all three species, Mediterranean populations clearly differed in mandible shape from the extra-Mediterranean ones. Among the three, the direction of geographic phenotypic changes was significantly similar in the striped and common dolphin, while the bottlenose dolphin was the most divergent species, differing both in size and allometric trajectory. Shape variation of the two former species highlighted a morphological convergence in the Atlantic, and a phenotypic divergence in the Mediterranean. Shape differences among the three dolphin species were interpreted in the light of different prey preferences, feeding strategies and habitat partitioning to avoid direct competition. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: On 7 November 2017 a solitary Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, Sousa plumbea (G. Cuvier, 1829), was sighted in Karavolas Bay, near the port of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. On 14, 16 and 17 November 2017 another humpback dolphin sighting, likely the same individual, was recorded 100 km further west in Souda Bay, Crete. North Crete is the third area where this Lessepsian species was sighted in the Mediterranean Sea after records in Israel in 2001 and in SE Turkey in 2016. To reach the north coast of Crete, the dolphin crossed deep offshore waters that are theoretically incompatible with its typical coastal and shallow habitat. The distance travelled by this dolphin (1000-2330 km depending on the path followed) is the largest movement recorded for this species. Our observations show the potential of humpback dolphins to reach the shallow and coastal waters of the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, where native populations of the vulnerable common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the endangered short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) occur. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cooperation between allied individuals and groups is ubiquitous in human societies, and vocal communication is known to play a key role in facilitating such complex human behaviors [1, 2]. In fact, complex communication may be a feature of the kind of social cognition required for the formation of social alliances, facilitating both partner choice and the execution of coordinated behaviors [3]. As such, a compelling avenue for investigation is what role flexible communication systems play in the formation and maintenance of cooperative partnerships in other alliance-forming animals. Male bottlenose dolphins in some populations form complex multi-level alliances, where individuals cooperate in the pursuit and defense of an important resource: access to females [4]. These strong relationships can last for decades and are critical to each male's reproductive success [4]. Convergent vocal accommodation is used to signal social proximity to a partner or social group in many taxa [5, 6], and it has long been thought that allied male dolphins also converge onto a shared signal to broadcast alliance identity [5–8]. Here, we combine a decade of data on social interactions with dyadic relatedness estimates to show that male dolphins that form multi-level alliances in an open social network retain individual vocal labels that are distinct from those of their allies. Our results differ from earlier reports of signature whistle convergence among males that form stable alliance pairs. Instead, they suggest that individual vocal labels play a central role in the maintenance of differentiated relationships within complex nested alliances. Vocal convergence is frequently used to signal social proximity between individuals. King et al. show that multi-level dolphin alliances do not converge onto shared calls but retain individual vocal labels. This suggests that vocal labels play a central role in the recognition of cooperative partners and competitors in complex biological markets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The release of captive dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) from South Korean marine parks, which occurred in 2013, 2015, and 2017, is described and evaluated for its usefulness for conservation of coastal ecosystems. The campaign to free the dolphins created a flagship species, uniting the efforts of national government agencies, local government, and NGOs. However, the Korean management agencies framed the release as a species-specific conservation intervention, while the NGOs brought forward welfare-based demands for the curtailment of cetacean captivity. We argue that the release of the Korean dolphins changed the policy climate, to facilitate two major policy changes: revision of anti-whaling regulations to prohibit capture of cetaceans for exhibit, and improvement of regulations for rescue, rehabilitation, and release of stranded marine animals. Tradeoffs between welfare and conservation concerns are described in terms of risk for the management agency, welfare for the animals, and feasibility of a continued commitment to maintain the viability of the dolphin stock in the wild.

ABSTRACT: Coastal developments continue to increase in Western Australia (WA) despite limited information on environmental consequences for coastal dolphins. As an example, a gas processing facility was constructed near the town of Onslow in the Pilbara region in 2012–2015. Boat-based surveys to estimate abundance, density and movement patterns of two species of coastal dolphins in waters around the Onslow development site and Thevenard Island began in 2015. Employing POPAN mark-recapture models, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) total abundance estimate corrected for the unmarked proportion of the population was 79 SE ± 24 (CI 43-148) for Onslow. There were insufficient resightings of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) to model abundance accurately. The densities were similar between both sites for each species; 0.59 bottlenose dolphins per km2in coastal Onslow waters versus 0.83 bottlenose dolphins per km2around Thevenard Island and 0.36 humpback dolphins per km2at Onslow and 0.38 humpback dolphins per km2around Thevenard Island. The density of humpback dolphins, although low, is comparable to estimates across their range. Movements of the two species between the island and coastal waters of the mainland was not detected. The Australian snubfin dolphin was not sighted during these surveys. The study confirms that Indo-Pacific bottlenose and Australian humpback dolphins use the waters near Onslow, however the low re-capture rates suggest that their home ranges are larger than, and only partially overlapping, the 128 km2 area. More intense sampling effort would be required to precisely estimate abundance for humpback dolphins. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Many animal species engage in social object play with movable objects. Two bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and one Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) owned by the Kujukushima Aquarium, Japan, occasionally shared and played with an object. Herein, we report social object play between two dolphins exchanging a ball in water. Just before delivery of the ball, one dolphin made an action to request the ball from the dolphin that possessed the ball. This request behavior is also discussed in this report. This study is the first to report two different cetacean species engaging in social object play with one object. © 2018 Ikeda et al.

ABSTRACT: Sexual segregation is widespread in mammals, although the proximate causes are poorly understood in monomorphic species. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), which exhibit a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics, offer a useful lens to examine the ecological and social drivers of sexual segregation. While ecological hypotheses suggest that sexual segregation is a by-product of sex-specific ecological preferences (e.g., related to habitat, foraging, or predator avoidance), the social hypothesis proffers that segregation results from same-sex preferences (e.g., due to cooperative benefits) and/or opposite-sex avoidance (e.g., due to competitive or exploitative interactions). Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin females range from nearly solitary to highly sociable. Males associate in alliances that cooperate to sequester individual females and exclude competing males. Given evidence for allied sexual coercion, our primary hypothesis was that sexual segregation is driven by female avoidance of aggressive males. However, given robust evidence for sex-biased foraging tactics, ecological factors likely also contribute. Using the Sexual Segregation and Aggregation Statistic with 17,468 sighting records spanning 31 years, we found strong sexual segregation. Unique to our work, we analyzed the direction of joins and leaves between males and females from focal observations (N = 10,715 fission-fusion events, 87 females, 111 males) to determine which sex drives sexual segregation. Females drove segregation by rarely joining and often leaving males. Although ecological factors likely reinforce sexual segregation, social factors predominate. This study demonstrates a sex-bias in fission-fusion dynamics in a socially complex wild mammal population and offers strong empirical support to the social hypothesis of sexual segregation. © The Author(s) 2017.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring and assessing marine biodiversity relies upon adequate and accurate knowledge of population and distribution patterns of ecologically important species. Cetaceans are recognised both as functionally important and as flagship species and have been the target of monitoring and conservation programs. The habitat specialist Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is the second most common cetacean in the Persian Gulf. Mousa Bay in the northwestern Persian Gulf is an important, but highly industrialised habitat for this species. We developed a systematic and comprehensive distance sampling survey carried out from 2014 to 2016 to estimate abundance and population density of humpback dolphin in this bay. To evaluate distribution pattern of the species, eight environmental variables were measured and employed in a zero-inflated generalised additive model (ZINB GAM). With an estimated abundance of 92 animals (64–131, 95% CI) and density of 0.123 animal/km2 (0.086–0.176, 95% CI), our results revealed Mousa Bay as one of the largest population of humpback dolphin in northern latitudes of its global range. Based on ZINB GAM findings, distance to coastlines, depth, EC, and chlorophyll a concentration significantly influence the distribution of the species. Our results highlighted that physiographic parameters and resource availability are the most important motivators of the species distribution in shallow nearshore waters. Biotic (e.g. water quality) factors due to strongly being affected by the variability of time and space ranked after physiographic variables. The high tendency of humpback dolphins to enter in highly developed foreshore of Mousa Bay raise the need for conservation-oriented studies to inform conservation planning. This study provides a basis for monitoring humpback dolphin and assessing ecosystem health of northern Persian Gulf. © 2018

ABSTRACT: The Orinoco river dolphin Inia geoffrensis humboldtiana is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List used to categorize the Orinoco river dolphin as Vulnerable; however, it is now considered Data Deficient because current information about threats, ecology and the population are limited and out of date. The Red Book of Venezuelan Wildlife categorizes the species as ‘vulnerable’, and the Venezuelan National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan identifies ex situ conservation actions for threatened species. The distribution of this river dolphin in Venezuela extends from the Casiquiare canal, upper/mid-/lower Orinoco River, tributaries, through the delta, where its populations are threatened by the deterioration of habitat, illegal hunting and accidental capture in fishing nets. Captive-breeding programmes for cetacean river species worldwide, including the Orinoco river dolphin, have led to an increase in knowledge about reproductive parameters and biological data, which is helpful for future conservation planning. Detailed husbandry manuals and management procedures, which were insufficient at the time the data were collected, are of vital importance for the sustained survival and reproduction of this species ex situ, especially if the conservation status should change from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered. Valencia Aquarium, Venezuela, housed Orinoco river dolphins for 41 years, from 1975 onwards. In 1994 a reproductive group was established with one male and two females. Over the next 22 years (1994–2016) eight calves were born. The following report details the prenatal management, birthing events, lactation periods, and sizes, weights and survival of the young. © 2018 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Determining the optimum placement of braces in steel frames has always been one of the most challenging issues in structural engineering. In this paper, the size and placement of the X-braces in planar frame structures is determined in a way that the total weight of the braced frames becomes minimum, while satisfying the design requirements and constraints. Variables of the optimization contain the cross sections for beams, columns, and X-braces as well as the placement of these braces in the frames. Attempt has also been made to consider all the constraints of an actual design problem. One of the other objectives of this study is to investigate the effect of including or excluding some of the constraints affecting the optimization of the planar frame design. For this purpose, the Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) and CBO-MDM algorithms have been utilized. Modified Dolphin Monitoring (MDM) operator is recently developed for improving the performance of the metaheuristic algorithms. Here, this operator is utilized to enhance the performance of the CBO algorithm to optimize the weight of the frames. For additional comparison of the results, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) are used. © 2018, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about the population ecology of the recently described bottlenose dolphin species Tursiops australis. The classification of this species is still under debate, but this putative species is thought to be comprised of small and genetically distinct populations (including sub-populations under increasing anthropogenic threats) and is likely endemic to coastal southern Australia. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellite loci were used to assess genetic variation and hierarchical population structure of coastal T. cf. australis across a range of spatial scales and environmental discontinuities between southern Western Australia (WA) and central South Australia (SA). Overall, genetic diversity was similar to that typically found for bottlenose dolphins, although very low mtDNA diversity was found in Gulf St. Vincent (GSV) dolphins. We found historical genetic subdivision and likely differences in colonisation between GSV and Spencer Gulf, outer- and inner-gulf locations, and SA/WA and previously identified Victorian/Tasmanian populations. A hierarchical metapopulation structure was revealed along southern Australia, with at least six genetic populations occurring between Esperance, WA and southern Tasmania. In addition, fine-scale genetic subdivision was observed within each SA/WA population. In general, contemporary migration was limited throughout southern Australia, but an important gene flow pathway was identified eastward along the Great Australian Bight. Management strategies that promote gene flow among populations should be implemented to assist with the maintenance of the inferred metapopulation structure. Further research into the population ecology of this species is needed to facilitate well-informed management decisions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are distributed globally in tropical and warmtemperate waters with coastal and offshore ecotypes known. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, common bottlenose dolphins are typically found in offshore waters as far as 41° N and in coastal waters as far as 38° N. Despite considerable survey effort, the species has not been previously recorded in Canadian Pacific waters. Results: On 29 July 2017, a group of approximately 200 common bottlenose dolphins were observed together with approximately 70 false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) in waters of 16.5° C at 50° N during a pelagic seabird and marine mammal survey off the west coast of northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Conclusions: This sighting represents the only occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins recorded in Canadian Pacific waters and, to our knowledge, is the most northerly record for this species in the eastern North Pacific. It is also the first sighting record of false killer whales in non-coastal waters in British Columbia, Canada. The occurrence of both species may be associated with a prolonged period of warming in offshore regions of the eastern North Pacific. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The costs of predation may exert significant pressure on the mode of communication used by an animal, and many species balance the benefits of communication (e.g. mate attraction) against the potential risk of predation. Four groups of toothed whales have independently evolved narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation signals. These signals help NBHF species avoid predation through acoustic crypsis by echolocating and communicating at frequencies inaudible to predators such as mammal-eating killer whales. Heaviside's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) are thought to exclusively produce NBHF echolocation clicks with a centroid frequency around 125 kHz and little to no energy below 100 kHz. To test this, we recorded wild Heaviside's dolphins in a sheltered bay in Namibia. We demonstrate that Heaviside's dolphins produce a second type of click with lower frequency and broader bandwidth in a frequency range that is audible to killer whales. These clicks are used in burst-pulses and occasional click series but not foraging buzzes. We evaluate three different hypotheses and conclude that the most likely benefit of these clicks is to decrease transmission directivity and increase conspecific communication range. The expected increase in active space depends on background noise but ranges from 2.5 (Wenz Sea State 6) to 5 times (Wenz Sea State 1) the active space of NBHF signals. This dual click strategy therefore allows these social dolphins to maintain acoustic crypsis during navigation and foraging, and to selectively relax their crypsis to facilitate communication with conspecifics. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Individual identification plays a major role in our understanding of the biology, ecology and behavior in cetaceans. Being able to tell individuals apart can provide invaluable insight into basic biological and scientific questions, but is also highly relevant to science-based conservation. Given the importance of individual identification, it appears vital to improve existing identification methods and find new ones. Here, we present a novel identification method of using facial information, with common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) as a case study. In dolphins, dorsal fins are typically used for identification, but not all individuals or species are sufficiently marked. We show that facial features in bottlenose dolphins are long-term and consistent across the left and right sides, and may enable calves (which tend to have unmarked fins) to be re-identified after weaning, thus increasing cross-generational knowledge. This novel method can complement dorsal fin identification by helping document mark changes over time and reduce false negative or positive errors. It also shows that current identification methods can still be improved. With increasing prevalence of digital photography and computer-aided matching, it may become more viable to use ‘unconventional’ means of identification. We encourage other researchers to explore their photographic records for similar discoveries. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Reproductive parameters of the Amazon river dolphin, or boto Inia geoffrensis, were estimated from a population of individually recognizable animals in the Brazilian Amazon throughout 24 years. Gestation lasts 12.3-13 months, and calves are nursed for 1.5-5.8 years. The mean inter-birth interval is 4.6 years, and there is no evidence of reproductive senescence. Females first give birth at a mean age of 9.7 years and become sexually mature at body lengths of 180-200 cm. Body length at birth averages 84 cm. The annual pregnancy rate was ~0.4, but the annual birth rate was 0.22; therefore, almost half of pregnancies do not result in a calf seen by our research team. Entanglement of neonates in monofilament gillnets might account, at least in part, for these losses. Births can occur year round, but peak at low water, when botos and their newborn calves are concentrated on river margins. Despite profound physical and behavioural adaptations over millions of years to a life in shallow, fresh waters and complex habitats, the boto has remarkably similar reproductive characteristics to those of its marine counterparts, dolphins of the family Delphinidae. The fundamental reproductive characteristics of small odontocetes have apparently been robust to change over a very considerable evolutionary timespan. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

ABSTRACT: Banten Bay is an estuarine ecosystem which serves as important habitat for Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), also functions as a fishing ground for artisanal fishers, maritime port, shipyard, and surrounded by industrial zones. One major impact from land-based industrial development is the load of heavy metal pollution (Zinc -Zn), which cause a potential threat to Irrawaddy dolphin population as a predator in the ecosystem through bioaccumulation process from its prey. This research aimed to measure ecological risks in Irrawaddy dolphin due to Zn contamination in its potential prey, i.e., sardines (Sardinella fimbriata) and squids (Loligo sp.). Survey on dolphin population was conducted in Banten Bay from Jan 2013 to Feb 2014 with participatory mapping and visual observation, while Zn concentration in dolphin's preys was measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and analyzed by Risk Quotient (RQ) with base assumption that Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC) of Zn is 6.7 mg/kg wet weight. Results showed that concentration of Zn in squids (7.67±1.02 mg/kg WW) was higher than that of sardines (3.46±0.29 mg/kg WW). Thus, squids have a moderate risk, while sardines have low risk to bioaccumulation of Zn in Irrawaddy dolphin. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Growth and body condition can be used as indices of health and fitness, but are difficult to collect for populations of conservation concern where individuals cannot be captured. We incorporated a laser photogrammetry system into boat-based photo-identification surveys that underpin individual-based studies of cetacean populations. These data were integrated with >25 years of observations from a temperate bottlenose dolphin population in Scotland to investigate the influence of sex on growth patterns, effects of birth order on calf size and the longer term consequences of variation in early growth. Field measurements of the distance from the blowhole to the dorsal fin were made in multiple years from 87 dolphins that had been followed from birth, ranging in age from newborn to 26 years. These estimates were validated against direct measurements of 12 individuals that had previously been captured and released in Florida and two study individuals that subsequently stranded. Using relationships derived from other stranded individuals, age-specific body lengths were used to produce growth curves that were based entirely on remote observations. Multilevel regression growth curve analyses suggested males and females showed similar patterns of growth, unlike bottlenose dolphins in sub-tropical areas, and growth was best described by a Richards’ growth curve. Newborn length was unrelated to sex; however, females’ first calves were shorter than subsequent calves. Sample sizes remain small, yet there was evidence of fitness consequences of variation in calf length; calves that died in their first winter were significantly shorter than those that survived. The incorporation of this simple-to-use and inexpensive method into individual-based photo-identification studies provides new opportunities to non-invasively investigate drivers of variation in growth and the demographic consequences of variation in early growth in cetaceans from protected populations. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Social and network analyses that incorporate information on individuals within a population enhance our knowledge of complex species. In this study, the social structure of wild bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, was analyzed by examining the dynamics of the whole population and then of individuals classed by sex, age, and area. One hundred and twenty-one dolphins were identified during 522 sightings between 2012 and 2015. The mean half-weight association index (HWI) of the population was 0.07 ± 0.02. The highest HWIs for individuals of known sex were for female-male pairs. Mean within-class HWI was significantly higher than mean between-class HWI for both age and area classes. Ordinations and sociograms were used to visualize social networks. Permutation tests revealed nonrandom associations for the population overall and both between and within classes. Temporal analyses showed associations persisting for >1,000 d. The whole population's best fit model was for two levels of casual acquaintances. Movement analyses demonstrated the use of the inner estuary by only 25% of the population revealing a potential community division by area. The difference between mean HWI when socializing (0.09 ± 0.03) compared to foraging (0.06 ± 0.03) was significant. These results highlight the importance of localized research, reflecting the complexity found in bottlenose dolphin societies globally. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: World populations or stock distinction of Tursiops truncatus has been difficult to assess, because of large variations in morphology, habitat, feeding habits, and social structure among areas, which may reflect phylogenetic segregation or ecological plasticity. In the Gulf of California, Mexico, two common bottlenose dolphin ecotypes (inshore and offshore) have been reported. The offshore ecotype is frequently observed in association with sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) but the reason for this is still unknown. To explore the degree of resource partitioning/overlap between these species and stocks, we used skin stable isotope values (δ13C, δ15N) to estimate quantitative metrics of isotopic niche width (Bayesian standard ellipse areas, SEAB) and estimated their diet composition using Bayesian isotopic mixing models. The inshore ecotype in different regions (north, central, and south) of the Gulf of California exhibited distinct δ15N values and SEAB, suggesting a latitudinal gradient in nitrogen sources of coastal localities. The SEAB of inshore and offshore bottlenose dolphin ecotypes was completely distinct, indicating resource partitioning. Associated offshore ecotype and sperm whales had overlapping SEAB. The isotopic mixing model indicates that a considerable proportion of both species’ diet is large Humbolt squid. Our results suggest that resource partitioning and species association are two strategies that bottlenose dolphin ecotypes use in this zone. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: A juvenile female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba live stranded on 4 March 2016 at Alassio, western Ligurian Sea coast, Italy. The dolphin died shortly after stranding, and a complete postmortem examination was performed. Necropsy revealed severe tracheal occlusion and unilateral bronchial stenosis with luminal accumulation of abundant green-yellow mucousgelatinous material. Histological features suggestive of tracheobronchial aspergillosis were observed. Cultures of lung tissue and tracheo-bronchial exudate isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, identified by a Microseq D2 LSUrDNA fungal sequencing kit. A pan-Herpesvirus nested-PCR assay on frozen samples obtained from multiple organs was positive. Phylogenetic analysis on the partial DNA polymerase gene revealed that the striped dolphin isolate was closely related to known cetacean Alphaherpesvirus sequences from the same host species. Attempted virus isolation was unsuccessful. The tissue levels of different persistent organic pollutants and the toxicological stress, evaluated using a theoretical model, showed a severely impaired immune response. This study reports the first case of occlusive mycotic tracheobronchitis in a free-living cetacean and the first molecular identification of an Alphaherpesvirus in a free-ranging striped dolphin stranded on the coast of Italy. © Inter-Research 2018.

ABSTRACT: Coastal resident and pelagic nonresident bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, have been described in north-central Chile. Using long-term residence data (over 13 years of photo-identification) and genetic mtDNA information, we analysed the social dynamics through time and the genetic variation of this long-term resident population, and evaluated its sociogenetic interaction with nonresidents. Pelagic nonresident dolphins exhibited a higher level of genetic diversity than coastal residents and a significant difference in genetic structure was detected between them. Based on the difference in haplotype numbers and frequencies between resident and nonresident populations and between resident males and females, we propose a population dynamic model in which the resident population is composed of (1) resident females (founder lineages) and some of their female descendants that were born in and remained in the group, without effective female immigration from the nonresident population, (2) resident male descendants of the founder lineage that were born in and remained in the group and (3) resident males that were incorporated from the pelagic groups. Male-biased migration from nonresident pelagic groups into the resident population likely contributes to genetic variation and therefore may help limit inbreeding in the resident population. Finally, we propose that the peripatric model of population differentiation, where resident groups are sporadically connected to the pelagic population, may explain the origin of this unique resident population of bottlenose dolphins along the Chilean coast. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have intrinsic challenges that include long propagation delays, high mobility of sensor nodes due to water currents, Doppler spread, delay variance, multipath, attenuation and geometric spreading. The existing Weighting Depth and Forwarding Area Division Depth Based Routing (WDFAD-DBR) protocol considers the weighting depth of the two hops in order to select the next Potential Forwarding Node (PFN). To improve the performance of WDFAD-DBR, we propose DOlphin and Whale Pod Routing protocol (DOW-PR). In this scheme, we divide the transmission range into a number of transmission power levels and at the same time select the next PFNs from forwarding and suppressed zones. In contrast to WDFAD-DBR, our scheme not only considers the packet upward advancement, but also takes into account the number of suppressed nodes and number of PFNs at the first and second hops. Consequently, reasonable energy reduction is observed while receiving and transmitting packets. Moreover, our scheme also considers the hops count of the PFNs from the sink. In the absence of PFNs, the proposed scheme will select the node from the suppressed region for broadcasting and thus ensures minimum loss of data. Besides this, we also propose another routing scheme (whale pod) in which multiple sinks are placed at water surface, but one sink is embedded inside the water and is physically connected with the surface sink through high bandwidth connection.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the levels and trends of the 16 USEPA priority PAHs in the blubber of 37 Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins sampled during the period 2012-2017 from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. Σ16PAHs concentrations (17.6-6080 ng g−1 wet weight) were at median level compared to dolphin species worldwide. Humpback dolphins affiliated with the hotspots of PAHs, had significantly higher levels of Σ16PAHs than individuals from the other areas in the PRE. Moreover, dolphins stranded on the coast of Lingdingyang are significantly more contaminated by Σ16PAHs than those in the West-four region of the PRE, which appears to reflect the heterogeneous distribution of PAHs in the environment. A marked decline in blubber Σ16PAHs levels is observed over the studied period, with the control of a range of confounding factors. The trend is strongly and statistically significant (p < 0.0001), indicating that the loading of PAHs are gradually being reduced. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Information gaps resulting from incomplete data used to describe habitat configuration frequently hinder the efficacy of habitat protection action (HPA) for an animal with a wide distribution range. Such concerns are particularly important for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, inhabiting disturbed coastal and estuarine habitats. This study inspected the likely habitat use of the Taiwanese humpback dolphin, an endemic subspecies that inhabits a highly disturbed habitat. Habitat use was evaluated using species distribution modelling with occurrence data from field surveys and remotely sensed oceanographic layers. Likely core habitats of the Taiwanese humpback dolphin were predicted near estuaries. The chlorophyll-a concentration was the primary factor affecting the distribution of the Taiwanese humpback dolphin. Bathymetry influenced the humpback dolphin distribution in the early 1980s, but became less important in the early 2010s. Significant sea surface temperature increases in the estuarine and coastal waters and chlorophyll-a concentration decreases in the inshore waters were observed from the 1980s to the 2010s, indicating declining ecosystem productivity and shifting ecosystem functions. These oceanographic changes may be associated with adverse consequences of coastal alterations in western Taiwan. We propose revising the current HPA scope by refining the HPA zoning, integrating coastal and watershed management, implementing regulatory fishery management, and designing and conducting restoration measures in compromised habitats and watershed landscapes. The need to reassess the current baselines of habitat use and HPA complex for the humpback dolphin across its natural range has been addressed. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: The status of the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) around the Falkland Islands (south-west Atlantic) has been long debated, since most records published to date lack supporting information. There is also considerable scope for confusion with the sympatric Peale's dolphin (L. australis), which has a similar external appearance. Results: A literature review confirmed one previously-published record as dusky dolphin; a skull that apparently originated from the Falklands in 1955. Four new photographically-supported records of dusky dolphin are described, comprising three sightings and one live stranding. Two sightings consisted of the same dusky dolphin individual in a mixed-species association with Peale's dolphins in coastal waters. An additional sighting established their use of deep, offshore waters around the Falklands. Conclusion: The dusky dolphin is a confirmed component of the Falkland Islands cetacean community, but appears to be relatively uncommon. The first documented occurrences of an association between dusky and Peale's dolphins emphasises the need for vigilance when identifying dolphins during cetacean surveys in the wider South American region. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Fisheries depredation by marine mammals is an economic concern worldwide. We combined questionnaires, acoustic monitoring, and participatory experiments to investigate the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins in the fisheries of Northern Cyprus, and the extent of their conflict with set-nets, an economically important metier of Mediterranean fisheries. Dolphins were present in fishing grounds throughout the year and were detected at 28% of sets. Net damage was on average six times greater where dolphins were present, was correlated with dolphin presence, and the associated costs were considerable. An acoustic deterrent pinger was tested, but had no significant effect although more powerful pingers could have greater impact. However, our findings indicate that effective management of fish stocks is urgently required to address the overexploitation that is likely driving depredation behaviour in dolphins, that in turn leads to net damage and the associated costs to the fisheries. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The change towards intensive agriculture has led to an increase in the use of pesticides. In addition, legacy pesticides, such as organochlorines are still present in the environment. Ten Franciscana dolphins were accidentally killed by netting in a coastal area of Argentina in Buenos Aires province. From these animals, organochlorine, organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides were analyzed in liver, bubbler and melon tissues. The concentrations of Σendosulfan ranged from not detectable values (nd) to 3539 ng g−1 lw, with the maximum level in melon tissue. DDE was present in 60% of all samples at concentrations from nd to 6672 ng g−1 lw, indicating historical DDT contamination. The presence of endosulfan and heptachlor in a nursling calf indicated a transfer of these pesticides through lactational and placental transport. The concentrations of organophosphates and pyrethroids were below the limit of detection, reflecting the low persistence of these compounds. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife hunting for commercial products has been responsible for decline of many large vertebrates around the globe. An Amazonian example of this worldwide trend is the use of caiman and dolphins as bait for the piracatinga catfish fishery. While it is a controversial issue in Amazonia conservation, there is no data on key biological aspects, such as age and sex, of those animals illegally hunted for bait. This lack of data complicates understanding of the true impact of bait-hunting on the targeted species. In this study, we present results of one year of participatory monitoring of bait-hunting in 12 communities in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR), Brazilian Amazonia, during which participants recorded aspects of hunting activity and biometric data of animals used as piracatinga bait. The piracatinga fishery at MSDR has distinct spatial and seasonal patterns, being concentrated close to distribution centers and intensifying during the dry season. Adult male black caiman is the main bait used by fishermen, but viscera of commercial fish provide a potential alternative bait source for the piracatinga fishery. All recorded bait hunting was for caiman, none for dolphins. Despite the predominant use of caiman as bait, MSDR caiman populations remain the largest within the species' distribution. We suggest that informal management of caiman conducted by MSDR residents has guaranteed regional sustainability of the piracatinga fishery. In a broader context, the current study highlights the potential for participatory research with local populations in formulating well-informed decisions for the conservation of natural resources and economic alternatives focused on the conservation of human-natural systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: For highly mobile species that nevertheless show fine-scale patterns of population genetic structure, the relevant evolutionary mechanisms determining structure remain poorly understood. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is one such species, exhibiting complex patterns of genetic structure associated with local habitat dependence in various geographic regions. Here we studied bottlenose dolphin populations in the Gulf of California and Pacific Ocean off Baja California where habitat is highly structured to test associations between ecology, habitat dependence and genetic differentiation. We investigated population structure at a fine geographic scale using both stable isotope analysis (to assess feeding ecology) and molecular genetic markers (to assess population structure). Our results show that there are at least two factors affecting population structure for both genetics and feeding ecology (as indicated by stable isotope profiles). On the one hand there is a signal for the differentiation of individuals by ecotype, one foraging more offshore than the other. At the same time, there is differentiation between the Gulf of California and the west coast of Baja California, meaning that for example, nearshore ecotypes were both genetically and isotopically differentiated either side of the peninsula. We discuss these data in the context of similar studies showing fine-scale population structure for delphinid species in coastal waters, and consider possible evolutionary mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are highly versatile breath-holding predators that have adapted to a wide range of foraging niches from rivers and coastal ecosystems to deep-water oceanic habitats. Considerable research has been done to understand how bottlenose dolphins manage O2 during diving, but little information exists on other gases or how pressure affects gas exchange. Here we used a dynamic multi-compartment gas exchange model to estimate blood and tissue O2, CO2, and N2 from high-resolution dive records of two different common bottlenose dolphin ecotypes inhabiting shallow (Sarasota Bay) and deep (Bermuda) habitats. The objective was to compare potential physiological strategies used by the two populations to manage shallow and deep diving life styles. We informed the model using species-specific parameters for blood hematocrit, resting metabolic rate, and lung compliance. The model suggested that the known O2 stores were sufficient for Sarasota Bay dolphins to remain within the calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL), but insufficient for Bermuda dolphins that regularly exceeded their cADL. By adjusting the model to reflect the body composition of deep diving Bermuda dolphins, with elevated muscle mass, muscle myoglobin concentration and blood volume, the cADL increased beyond the longest dive duration, thus reflecting the necessary physiological and morphological changes to maintain their deep-diving life-style. The results indicate that cardiac output had to remain elevated during surface intervals for both ecotypes, and suggests that cardiac output has to remain elevated during shallow dives in-between deep dives to allow sufficient restoration of O2 stores for Bermuda dolphins. Our integrated modeling approach contradicts predictions from simple models, emphasizing the complex nature of physiological interactions between circulation, lung compression, and gas exchange. © 2018 Fahlman, Jensen, Tyack and Wells.

ABSTRACT: Manganese concentrations were determined in muscle, kidney, liver, spleen, lung and fat tissues and skin of three cetacean species, the bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus), striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and Risso’s (Grampus griseus) dolphins, stranded along the Croatian Adriatic coast between 1995 and 2013. Mean ranges determined in tissues were (mg/kg, ww): muscle 0.23–0.27, liver 2.87–4.00, kidney 0.66–1.26, spleen 0.37–0.79, lung 0.18–0.57, skin 0.11–0.97, fat 0.06–0.42. The highest Mn mean levels in tissues were measured in species (mg/kg, ww): T. truncates lung 0.41, skin 0.97, fat 0.42; S. coeruleoalba muscle 0.26; G. griseus kidney 1.26, liver 4.00, spleen 0.64. Significant differences of Mn concentrations in the liver (p = 0.034), spleen (p = 0.037) and skin (p = 0.013) were found among the three dolphin species. Significant differences in Mn levels were found between young and adult T. truncates in kidney (p = 0.042), lung (p = 0.0040) and skin (p = 0.0034). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The human population of the Brazilian Amazon possesses a rich body of beliefs and practices that relate to river dolphins, which are also known as botos (Inia and Sotalia species). There is a widespread belief in their magical powers in relation to love enchantments. One form that this takes is "dolphin love charms" and these are widely in use in northern Brazil, and also in the largest southern cities. This paper considers the trade of cetacean products in the form of love charms in Brazil. Samples were obtained in the north (n = 70), northeast (n = 3) and southeast (n = 59) regions from 34 shops or municipal markets. A total of 38 of the 131 collected samples were evaluated by complete cytochrome b sequencing, revealing the use of two species: the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) (n = 3) and the domestic pig (Sus scrofa) (n = 10) and samples containing no animal material (n = 10) were also detected. Pigs are used to fake love charm products in Rio de Janeiro. However, whereas in the southeast there is no actual use of dolphin tissues in love charms, there is a widespread use of dolphin tissue in northern Brazil, including, muscle, eyes, penis and vagina. The data confirm a regular trade of dolphin products in large cities in the north and northeast of Brazil and the need for more intense actions from governmental agencies in order to curb this illegal trade. © 2018 Siciliano, Viana, Emin-Lima and Bonvicino.

ABSTRACT: The Black Sea subspecies of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus ponticus) is threatened and has a small range. Its population structure is little known: it possibly includes a few local coastal populations. We assessed connectivity between coastal groupings in six localities along 800 km of the coastline based on records of photo-identified animals between 2004 and 2014. Abundance of these groupings, as estimated, ranged between 76 and 174 individually distinctive dolphins. In total, there were 350 identified individuals, of which 91 (26%) were resighted within the same areas. However, only three cases of individual movements between local coastal populations were recorded at the distances between 135 and 325 km. Therefore, despite the absence of physical barriers, the coastal Black Sea population is fragmented into numerous resident or locally migrating groupings with site fidelity. These local populations are loosely connected to each other with rare movements between them. This fragmentation can be a factor contributing to short-term fluctuations in abundance of Black Sea bottlenose dolphins and their decline in some localities, despite the potentially high population growth rate.

ABSTRACT: An adult 273.7-kg, 266-cm male white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) stranded in Beaufort, North Carolina, on 16 April 2015 at 34.698125 N, -76.650476 W. Morphometrics, gross necropsy, and histopathologic evaluation were performed. Bilateral adrenal gland tumors (pheochromocytomas) were found and may have contributed to stranding. This is the first recorded white-beaked dolphin specimen to strand along the North Carolina coast, and it is the most southerly reported stranding of a white-beaked dolphin in the world. © Aquatic Mammals 2018.

ABSTRACT: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures composed of nuclear DNA decorated with histones and cytoplasmic peptides which antiparasitic properties have not previously been investigated in cetaceans. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were isolated from healthy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and stimulated with Neospora caninum tachyzoites and the NETs-agonist zymosan. In vitro interactions of PMN with the tachyzoites resulted in rapid extrusion of NETs. For the demonstration and quantification of cetacean NETs, extracellular DNA was stained by using either Sytox Orange® or Pico Green®. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence analyses demonstrated PMN-derived release of NETs upon exposure to tachyzoites of N. caninum. Co-localization studies of N. caninum induced cetacean NETs proved the presence of DNA adorned with histones (H1, H2A/H2B, H3, H4), neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pentraxin (PTX) confirming the molecular properties of mammalian NETosis. Dolphin-derived N. caninum-NETosis were efficiently suppressed by DNase I and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) treatments. Our results indicate that cetacean-derived NETs represent an ancient, conserved and relevant defense effector mechanism of the host innate immune system against N. caninum and probably other related neozoan parasites circulating in the marine environment. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The presence of high frequency components in dolphin echolocation signals and their possible significance in dolphin sonar is reported here, based on echolocation experiments conducted with several bottlenosed dolphins. Measurements on the animals' sonar capability under varied conditions, including imposed difficulties for target detection are discussed. Blindfolded dolphin test subjects were utilized in echo-ranging experiments at a fixed station as well as in free-swimming modes. The experiments involved detection of small targets at ranges measured in meters, in a presence or absence paradigm, where the animals were rewarded for correct decisions as to the target's presence or absence. Measurements on the time domain and power spectra of the biosonar transmissions, as well as angular response in terms of beampatterns were made. Results show that the animals changed their sonar parameters toward more intense, higher resolution capability when the difficulty of target detection was increased. The increase of detection difficulty was effected through the use of absorbing panels and the insertion of band limited noise in the dolphin sonar scenario. It was found that the animals increased their sonar transmit levels, their pulse repetition frequency, and high frequency content of their transmitted signals, which were contained in increasingly narrow sonar beams. The resulting parameter adjustments are analyzed in terms of the increased sonar difficulties imposed. The results are interpreted in terms of potential significance in man-made sonar architecture. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.

ABSTRACT: Trace element accumulation in the epidermis of cetaceans has been less studied. This study explored the feasibility of using epidermis as a surrogate tissue to evaluate internal contaminant burdens in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). Eleven trace elements were analyzed in the epidermis, muscle and liver tissues from 46 individuals of dolphins stranded along the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) coast between 2007 and 2013. Trace elemental concentrations varied among the three tissues, generally with the highest concentrations found in liver tissues and lowest in the epidermis (except Zn, As, and Pb). Zn concentration in the epidermis was the highest among all tissues, indicating that Zn could be an important element for the epidermis physiology. High concentrations of Hg and Cr in liver were likely due to an excessive intake by dolphins which consumed high Hg and Cr contaminated fishes in the PRE. Hg concentrations in epidermis and muscle tissues were significantly higher in the females than in males. Concentrations of V and Pb in liver, Se and Cd in both muscle and liver, and As and Hg in all tissue samples showed significantly positive relationships with body length. Hepatic Cu concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with the body length. Hg and As concentrations in epidermis showed significantly positive correlations with those in liver tissues. Thus this study proposed that epidermis could be used as a non-invasive monitoring tissue to evaluate Hg and As bioaccumulation in internal tissues of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins populations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary disease has been well documented in wild and managed dolphin populations. The marginal lymph nodes of the dolphin thorax provide lymphatic drainage to the lungs and can indicate pulmonary disease. This study standardized a technique for rapid, efficient, and thorough ultrasonographic evaluation of the marginal lymph nodes in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Thoracic ultrasonography was performed on 29 clinically healthy adult bottlenose dolphins. Reference intervals for lymph node dimensions and ultrasonographic characteristics of marginal lymph nodes were determined from four transducer orientations: longitudinal, transverse, oblique, and an orientation optimized to the ultrasonographer's eye. The relationship between lymph node dimensions and dolphin age, sex, length, weight, origin, and management setting (pool versus ocean enclosure) were also evaluated. The mean marginal lymph nodes measured 5.26 cm in length (SD = 1.10 cm, minimum = 3.04 cm, maximum = 7.61 cm, reference interval (10th to 90th percentiles per node dimension 3.78-6.55 cm) and 3.72 cm in depth (SD = 0.59 cm, minimum = 2.64, maximum = 5.38 cm, reference interval 2.98-4.50 cm). Sex, dolphin length, weight, and management setting had no effect on lymph node dimensions. Dolphins >30 yr of age had longer node lengths than dolphins 5-10 yr old. Node dimensions did differ between dolphins from various origins. Most commonly, the lymph node was found to be hyperechoic relative to surrounding soft tissues (98%) and to have irregular caudal borders (84%), ill-defined deep borders (83%), flat superficial border (67%), triangular or rounded triangle shape (59%), irregular cranial border (55%), and moderate heterogeneity (34%). The data reported in this study serve as a baseline reference that may contribute to earlier detection of pleural and pulmonary disease of managed and wild cetacean populations. © Copyright 2017 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Taxon-specific de novo protein-coding sequences are thought to be important for taxon-specific environmental adaptation. A recent study revealed that bottlenose dolphins acquired a novel isoform of aquaporin 2 generated by alternative splicing (alternative AQP2), which helps dolphins to live in hyperosmotic seawater. The AQP2 gene consists of four exons, but the alternative AQP2 gene lacks the fourth exon and instead has a longer third exon that includes the original third exon and a part of the original third intron. Here, we show that the latter half of the third exon of the alternative AQP2 arose from a non-protein-coding sequence. Intact ORF of this de novo sequence is shared not by all cetaceans, but only by delphinoids. However, this sequence is conservative in all modern cetaceans, implying that this de novo sequence potentially plays important roles for marine adaptation in cetaceans. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In the past two decades, dolphins have been used for analyzing the parameters of ocean like salinity and depth. For reliable communication in ocean environment, advanced techniques like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Adaptive Equalizer and Turbo Codes are used, but these are still in lack of data security. Vocalizations done by dolphins are special one because of its unique frequency and more secure in terms of communication. Hence in this paper, dolphin clicks are modelled and data transmission is carried out in underwater channel. The observed result used in the under communication field was compared with adaptive equalizer technique and performs better. A sample MRI image is also passed through the channel and received back with minimal error rate. © 2018, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Most mammals can accomplish acoustic recognition of other individuals by means of “voice cues,” whereby characteristics of the vocal tract render vocalizations of an individual uniquely identifiable. However, sound production in dolphins takes place in gas-filled nasal sacs that are affected by pressure changes, potentially resulting in a lack of reliable voice cues. It is well known that bottlenose dolphins learn to produce individually distinctive signature whistles for individual recognition, but it is not known whether they may also use voice cues. To investigate this question, we played back non-signature whistles to wild dolphins during brief capture-release events in Sarasota Bay, Florida. We hypothesized that non-signature whistles, which have varied contours that can be shared among individuals, would be recognizable to dolphins only if they contained voice cues. Following established methodology used in two previous sets of playback experiments, we found that dolphins did not respond differentially to non-signature whistles of close relatives versus known unrelated individuals. In contrast, our previous studies showed that in an identical context, dolphins reacted strongly to hearing the signature whistle or even a synthetic version of the signature whistle of a close relative. Thus, we conclude that dolphins likely do not use voice cues to identify individuals. The low reliability of voice cues and the need for individual recognition were likely strong selective forces in the evolution of vocal learning in dolphins. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In mammals, lactation can be the most energetically expensive part of the reproductive cycle. Thus, when energy needs are compromised due to predation risk, environmental disturbance, or resource scarcity, future reproductive success can be impacted. In marine and terrestrial environments, foraging behavior is inextricably linked to predation risk. But quantification of foraging energetics for lactating animals under predation risk is less understood. In this study, we used a spatially explicit individual-based model to study how changes in physiology (lactating or not) and the environment (predation risk) affect optimal behavior in dolphins. Specifically, we predicted that an adult dolphin without calf would incur lower relative energetic costs compared to a lactating dolphin with calf regardless of predation risk severity, antipredator behavior, or prey quality consumed. Under this state-dependent analysis of risk approach, we found predation risk to be a stronger driver in affecting total energetic costs (foraging plus locomotor costs) than food quality for both dolphin types. Further, contrary to our hypothesis, after accounting for raised energy demands, a lactating dolphin with calf does not necessarily have higher relative-to-baseline costs than a dolphin without calf. Our results indicate that both a lactating (with calf) and non-lactating dolphin incur lowered energetic costs under a risk-averse behavioral scheme, but consequently suffer from lost foraging calories. A lactating dolphin with calf could be particularly worse off in lost foraging calories under elevated predation risk, heightened vigilance, and increased hiding time relative to an adult dolphin without calf. Further, hiding time in refuge could be more consequential than detection distance for both dolphin types in estimated costs and losses incurred. In conclusion, our study found that reproductive status is an important consideration in analyzing risk effects in mammals, especially in animals with lengthy lactation periods and those exposed to both biological and nonbiological stressors. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We report on the interaction between common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821) and cast net fishermen in southern coast of Brazil. The fishery was monitored in the mouth of the Tramandaí River Estuary to investigate the seasonality of catches and their relationships with a set of variables: presence/absence and number of bottlenose dolphins, fishing area, temperature, salinity, wind and water flow direction in the channel. The mullet, Mugil liza Valenciennes, 1836 is the target species and was the dominant fish in the catches (77% of total catch; 50% in frequency; 0.2 ind. x f-1). The use of GLM models helped to reveal that the number of the bottlenose dolphins, time of year (months) and spatial variation of fishing activity were the main factors explaining the presence and abundance of mullet in the fishermen’s catches. The presences of bottlenose dolphins in the fishing area raise the probability of fishermen catch larger number of mullets with smaller fishing effort. However, the size of the mullet is influenced basically by seasonality. The mullets are the “currency” of bottlenose dolphins and fishermen interaction. There are reasons for concern about the sustainability of the southern Brazilian M. liza stock, once the decrease of this fishing resource can lead this rare and traditional fishery to the extinction. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

ABSTRACT: Purpose. The aim of the study was to distinguish the kinematic indicators influencing the average horizontal velocity of swimming (vCOM) with underwater dolphin kicks (UDK). Methods. The study involved 15 boys and 20 girls (mean age, 11.5 ± 1.00 years; height, 1.57 ± 0.09 m; training experience, 2.5 ± 1.00 years) practicing swimming 7 times a week. We determined the body height (H), the length of the body with the arms lifted (Lb), and the best result in the 50-m freestyle (pbt); characteristic anthropological points were marked on the body. The subjects performed UDK after a water-start for a distance of ca. 8 m (without a push-off from the wall). Movements were recorded with an underwater camera. The recordings were kinematically analysed with the SkillSpector program. On this basis, we calculated vCOM, frequency of movement (f), amplitude of movement (A), horizontal displacement in one cycle (Dpk), maximum flexion in the knee joints (KFmax), the product of f and A (IAf), the Strouhal number (St), and relative amplitude of toe movement (AREL). Results. The movements of the subjects were characterized as follows: vCOM = 1.08 ± 0.13 m/s, f = 2.00 ± 0.39 Hz, A = 0.46 ± 0.08 m, Dpk = 0.58 ± 0.10 m, IAf = 0.90 ± 0.11, KFmax = 71.37 ± 9.15°, St = 0.83 ± 0.08, AREL = 0.22 ± 0.04. A statistically significant correlation was found between vCOM and: H (r = 0.35), pbt (r =-0.52), f (r = 0.47), IAf (r = 0.72), KFmax (r =-0.53), and St (r =-0.36). Conclusions. UDK of young swimmers is characterized by low-speed swimming. This is effected by low swimming efficiency (low values of IAf and St, high value of KFmax). The proper amplitude and frequency of movements should be a priority in improving UDK. The UDK technique should be particularly enhanced among short competitors. © Human Movement 2018.

ABSTRACT: Under natural conditions bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) spend their time mostly feeding and then travelling, socializing, or resting. These activities are not randomly distributed, with feeding being higher in early morning and late afternoon. Social activities and vocal behavior seem to be very important in dolphin daily activity. This study aimed to describe the activity time-budget and its relation to vocal behavior for dolphins in a zoological park. We recorded behaviors and vocalizations of six dolphins over 2 months. All subjects performed more non-agonistic social interactions and play in the morning than in the afternoon. The different categories of vocalizations were distributed non-randomly throughout the day, with more chirps in the afternoon, when the animals were “less social.” The most striking result was the strong correlation between activities and the categories of vocalizations produced. The results confirm the association between burst pulses and whistles with social activities, but also reveal that both are also associated with solitary play. More chirps were produced when dolphins were engaged in socio-sexual behaviors, emphasizing the need for further questioning about the function of this vocal category. This study reveals that: (i) in a group kept in zoological management, social activities are mostly present in the morning; and (ii) the acoustic signals produced by dolphins may give a reliable representation of their current activities. While more studies on the context of signal production are needed, our findings provide a useful tool for understanding free ranging dolphin behavior when they are not visible. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The challenges of monitoring fully aquatic and long-living mammals have limited research on cetaceans that spans several decades to only a few populations. We report the first long-term assessment of association and residency patterns of dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) offKaikoura, New Zealand. Dorsal fin images, spanning 30 years of data collection, were used for photo-identification and social structure analyses. A total of 4,022 uniquely marked individuals were identified. Most (80%) were sighted only one time. The population of dusky dolphins offKaikoura appears to be open, with the possibility of immigration and emigration. Dusky dolphins showed preferences for assembly into either large or small groups, which appear to drive association patterns. They did not demonstrate significant preferred or avoided associations with each other, and had overall weak association patterns. Individuals reside in the Kaikoura area for approximately eight years, and also have temporally stable associations lasting approximately eight years. Dusky dolphins fit the model of a fission-fusion society, and their association patterns may reflect unique local ecological conditions and foraging opportunities. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Aim: We investigated the population genetic structure of a highly mobile marine species, the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen, 1833), along a geographical range with habitat transitions and historical dynamics to identify the causes of genetic divergence, and to assess the effect of past climate change on demography and population connectivity. Location: North-east Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Methods: Twenty microsatellite loci were used in conjunction with coalescent methods to investigate the genetic structure and demographic history of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Approximate Bayesian modelling was used to compare the support for alternative scenarios for the pattern of divergence over time in the context of known geographical transitions and environmental change over the course of the Quaternary. Results: We describe a novel pattern of structure among the extant populations along north–south and east–west axes. Modern gene flow shows strong directionality from north-east to south and west in the North Atlantic, and from west to east in the Mediterranean. On a temporal scale we found evidence for a progression starting with a division between the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea populations during the middle Pleistocene, followed by a division within the Mediterranean between the east and west basins towards the end of the Pleistocene, and finally an east–west division in the eastern North Atlantic at the start of the Holocene. Main conclusions: In the context of known population structure for other marine species along the same geographical range, our data facilitate inference of the more general processes that shaped patterns of biogeography across this region through the environmental transitions of the Quaternary. In particular, Pleistocene era divisions apparently reflect strong physical habitat boundaries, with later divisions associated with climate warming in the Holocene. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The mechanism by which odontocetes produce sound is unique among mammals. To gain insight into the physiological properties that support sound production in toothed whales, we examined myoglobin content ([Mb]), non-bicarbonate buffering capacity (β), fiber-type profiles, and myosin heavy chain expression of vocal musculature in two odontocetes: the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; n = 4) and the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena; n = 5). Both species use the same anatomical structures to produce sound, but differ markedly in their vocal repertoires. Tursiops produce both broadband clicks and tonal whistles, while Phocoena only produce higher frequency clicks. Specific muscles examined in this study included: (1) the nasal musculature around the phonic lips on the right (RNM) and left (LNM) sides of the head, (2) the palatopharyngeal sphincter (PPS), which surrounds the larynx and aids in pressurizing cranial air spaces, and (3) the genioglossus complex (GGC), a group of muscles positioned ventrally within the head. Overall, vocal muscles had significantly lower [Mb] and β than locomotor muscles from the same species. The PPS was predominately composed of small diameter slow-twitch fibers. Fiber-type and myosin heavy chain analyses revealed that the GGC was comprised largely of fast-twitch fibers (Tursiops: 88.6%, Phocoena: 79.7%) and had the highest β of all vocal muscles. Notably, there was a significant difference in [Mb] between the RNM and LNM in Tursiops, but not Phocoena. Our results reveal shared physiological characteristics of individual vocal muscles across species that enhance our understanding of key functional roles, as well as species-specific differences which appear to reflect differences in vocal capacities. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Within the past several decades, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Hong Kong have gone from being virtually unknown to being probably the best-studied dolphin population in Southeast Asia. Essentially nothing was known of their status prior to 1993, but they are now understood to be part of a large population (> 2,000 individuals) that inhabits the Pearl River Estuary of southern China. Approximately 130 to 200 dolphins occurred within Hong Kong's boundary in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the numbers have declined since then, with currently only about 65 to 70 dolphins found within the region at any one time. Despite an ambitious management scheme by the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department, mostly involving Hong Kong's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legislation, the dolphins appear to be at risk locally. A series of recommendations are hereby made to encourage improved management of these animals and include (1) management at the population level; (2) better assessment of cumulative impacts; (3) protection of critical habitat, especially along the west coast of Lantau Island; and (4) management with "teeth." If these suggested approaches are vigorously followed, I remain optimistic about the future of humpback dolphins in Hong Kong. Historical data show us that these animals can indeed recover from anthropogenic impacts but only if important habitat areas receive better protection than they are getting at present. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Assessments of demographic parameters are essential to understand the dynamics of wild populations, and for their efficient conservation and management. Here, sex-specific abundance, apparent survival and temporary emigration of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in Coffin Bay (CB), South Australia, is investigated. Results are based on capture–recapture modelling of photo-identification data and molecular analyses of biopsy samples collected during boat-based surveys between September 2013 and October 2015 in the inner and outer areas of CB. The total super-population of dolphins (including calves) using the entire study area (263 km2) was estimated with POPAN models at 306 (95% CI: 291–323), which included 71 (68–73) marked females and 57 (55–60) marked males. Seasonal estimates of abundance for the inner area of CB (123 km2) obtained with Pollock's Closed Robust Design models remained relatively constant over the two years (marked females: 52–60, marked males: 46–52, and total: 193–209). The high density of dolphins inhabiting the inner area (seasonal range: 1.57–1.70 individuals km−2), high apparent survival rates estimated for both sexes (females: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.96–1.0; males: 0.95; 0.82–0.99), and low temporary emigration rates (0.02; 95% CI: 0.01–0.11) indicate that the inner area of CB offers highly favourable habitat for these dolphins. 6-High biological productivity and low predation risk may promote these demographic patterns in the inner area of CB. 7-This study provides a robust baseline of sex-specific population demographics of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins with important implications for future research and their management and conservation in South Australia.

ABSTRACT: The welfare of a range of terrestrial animals can now be objectively estimated thanks to the well-established, but still expanding, field of welfare science. Despite continuing difficulties regarding definitions, it is generally agreed that welfare is assessed most accurately using multiple "animal-based measures"-that is, those evaluating aspects of the animal itself such as its behaviour. In addition, scientists combining behavioural, physiological, and cognitive animal-based indicators of welfare have found this approach is superior to using one-dimensional measures. But can the same approaches be used for marine mammals, and would assessments of their welfare have the same relevance in captivity as in wild environments? There is no reason why not, and we review the past decades of marine mammal research relevant to welfare, as well as the more recent advances in the field where this topic is starting to be addressed directly. We then use the example of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) to examine what the measures within an all-encompassing (i.e., "comprehensive") welfare assessment might look like. Looking to the future, we suggest directions for developing assessments for captive animals and explore how protocols might differ in wild settings. In conclusion, we find that the first steps are being made towards objectively assessing marine mammal welfare in captivity-through application of terrestrial animal approaches as well as through novel paradigms. Regarding bot-tlenose dolphins, several welfare measures have been proposed and should now be further validated and applied. It is hoped that this review will encourage continued research in marine mammal welfare assessment given the demonstrated initial achievements of bottlenose dolphin welfare studies and the potential for application to many different captive and wild contexts. © 2018, European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, is widely distributed along the western coast of South America. In Ecuador, a resident population of bottlenose dolphins inhabits the inner estuarine area of the Gulf of Guayaquil located in the southwestern part of the country and is under threat from different human activities in the area. Only one genetic study on South American common bottlenose dolphins has been carried out to date, and understanding genetic variation of wildlife populations, especially species that are identified as threatened, is crucial for defining conservation units and developing appropriate conservation strategies. In order to evaluate the evolutionary link of this population, we assessed the phylogenetic relationships, phylogeographic patterns, and population structure using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The sampling comprised: (i) 31 skin samples collected from free-ranging dolphins at three locations in the Gulf of Guayaquil inner estuary, (ii) 38 samples from stranded dolphins available at the collection of the "Museo de Ballenas de Salinas," (iii) 549 mtDNA control region (mtDNA CR) sequences from GenBank, and (iv) 66 concatenated sequences from 7-mtDNA regions (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, NADH dehydrogenase subunit I-II, cytochrome oxidase I and II, cytochrome b, and CR) obtained from mitogenomes available in GenBank. Our analyses indicated population structure between both inner and outer estuary dolphin populations as well as with distinct populations of T. truncatus using mtDNA CR. Moreover, the inner estuary bottlenose dolphin (estuarine bottlenose dolphin) population exhibited lower levels of genetic diversity than the outer estuary dolphin population according to the mtDNA CR. Finally, the estuarine bottlenose dolphin population was genetically distinct from other T. truncatus populations based on mtDNA CR and 7-mtDNA regions. From these results, we suggest that the estuarine bottlenose dolphin population should be considered a distinct lineage. This dolphin population faces a variety of anthropogenic threats in this area; thus, we highlight its fragility and urge authorities to issue prompt management and conservation measures. © 2018 Bayas-Rea et al.

ABSTRACT: A case of Vibrio parahaemolyticus- and V. alginolyticus-associated meningo-encephalitis in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) found stranded along the Adriatic coast of Italy in 2016 is herein reported, along with a minireview on V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus infections in aquatic mammals. Macroscopically, two abscesses were found in the dolphin's forebrain, along with an extensive, bilateral, parasitic broncho-pneumonia. Histologically, a suppurative-to-pyogranulomatous meningo-encephalitis involved the brain but not the cerebellum. Microbiological investigations yielded isolation of V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus from the aforementioned abscesses and from the brain parenchyma, respectively, with simultaneous recovery of Shewanella algae from the heart and of Photobacterium damselae from a blowhole swab. Although V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus, which are widely distributed across marine ecosystems worldwide, likely played a role in the development of the suppurative meningo-encephalitis in this dolphin, we are not aware of previous isolations of any of these two bacteria neither from cetacean brain lesions, nor from abscesses in aquatic mammals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Considering long-term study as one that through constant efforts subsidizes future studies, an example in Brazil is “Projeto Boto-Cinza” adding up more than 36 continued years of research and data application on Guiana dolphin biology, ecology and conservation. The first effort we dedicated was toward understand the fishing strategies used by this species, lasting about 10 years. Latter, as we gained knowledge in behavior study, the next step was to access parental care, youngling behavior, learning process of fishing, acoustic repertoire, and recently social networks. Throughout this time, it was possible to access also the mortality, and based on carcasses that gave such information, access parameters of life history such as reproductive anatomy of males and females, pregnancy period, birth size, and even age. Population density estimates could be done in different periods and areas; photo-identification enabled the detection of individual spatial fidelity. Modeling permitted to observe which parameters seem to be associated with the spatial distribution of population units inside the estuary. All these data contributed to a greater knowledge about the species, creation of public policies by conservation units’ chiefs, education purposes, and conservation of the species. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

ABSTRACT: Disentangling the intricacies governing dietary breadth in wild predators is important for understanding their role in structuring ecological communities and provides critical information for the management and conservation of ecologically threatened species. Here we combined dietary analysis, nutritional composition analysis of prey, literature data and nutritional geometry (right-angled mixture triangle models -RMT-) to examine the diet of the most threatened small cetacean in the western South Atlantic Ocean, the Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei). We applied a recently developed extension of niche theory based on the RMT to help understand the dietary strategies of this species. Our results showed that across their range the Franciscanas consumed prey with variable protein-to-lipid energy ratios (LMM, p < 0.001). In an intensive study of one area, FMA IV, we found that dolphins sub-populations, which recent genetic evidence suggest should be differentiated into three management units, have diets with different protein energy and water mass compositions, but similar protein-to-lipid energy ratios. Furthermore, dolphins from the three areas mixed different combinations of prey in their diets to achieve the observed macronutrient ratios. These results suggest that the different habitats that each sub-population occupies (estuarine, north marine area and south marine) might be associated with different prey composition niches, but similar realized nutritional niches. Future priorities are to better comprehend possible geographical and long-term seasonal effects on prey consumption and dietary breadth of the different Franciscana populations to identify potential impacts (environmental and human-related), enhance the current management strategies to protect this endangered marine predator. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In Brazil, the whale watching is practiced with different species, such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises. This activity facilitates the growth of the economic activities of communities in many regions of the country, and it may be a tool for awareness about the marine preservation and conservation. Moreover, the whale or dolphin watching also impacts native species. The Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (FN) is a worldwide watching tourism site due to the time of the development of activities and the ease to watch cetaceans, mainly the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). The aim of this study was to characterize the dolphin watching in FN. Additionally, we will investigate the applicability of the "Tourism Area Life Cycle" (TALC) approach for a tourism activity, identifying the main events or stages that promoted significant changes throughout the history of the activity in the archipelago. We observed that both landbased and boatbased (boat trips) are available in FN. The boat trips are more common and involve the triple of tourists than landbased watching. However, the last provides more informative and educational component. The history of dolphin watching tourism in FN was developed concomitantly with the tourism destination of the archipelago as a whole. Through TALC analysis, dolphin watching in FN had its development together with the destination development and, currently, both areas present stagnation stage indicators. In addition, the landbased watching, for being less impacting and more educative, has potential to increase the visitation. © 2018 Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

ABSTRACT: Managing fishing threats to populations of endemic, threatened Hector's and Māui dolphins around New Zealand is a complex and controversial issue, underpinned by uncertain scientific knowledge. As such, it can be argued that it falls into the realm of post-normal science, which advocates transparency about uncertainties and stakeholder peer review of knowledge feeding into decision-making. This paper focuses on selected examples of modelling and risk assessment research relating to Hector's and Māui dolphin threat management. It explores how knowledge is developed, shared and utilised by decision-makers, finding that uncertain scientific knowledge may be shared in ways that make it appear more certain, with some of the subjectivities involved in knowledge production hidden from view. Interviews with stakeholders illustrate how some stakeholders are aware of the subjectivities involved when uncertain knowledge underpins decision-making, so a lack of transparency may be leading to erosion of social trust in decisions made. This in turn can lead to a lack of support for dolphin conservation measures from key stakeholders such as the commercial fishing industry. The paper concludes that while moves towards increasing transparency and stakeholder involvement are apparent, a deeper embrace of post-normal science approaches to knowledge production and dissemination would contribute to effective dolphin threat management in New Zealand. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Dolphin Field has been producing gas since 1996, however predicting in place volumes, reserves and forecasting production has been a challenge since field inception. The fact that in place estimates have increased significantly since development sanction highlights that a range of geophysical, geological and petrophysical uncertainties are associated with the field. Historically, static volumes have been smaller than dynamic volumes estimated from material balance. The explanation of this difference traditionally related to uncertainty in contact depth (given the minimal data on contacts), that adversely caused poor predictions of water production in the historical models. Many of the reservoir units within the Greater Dolphin Area (GDA) are characterised by a heterolithic deltaic succession of centimeter scale very-fine sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. Given the thin-bedded nature of the reservoir, conventional wireline-logging tools lack the resolution to accurately resolve many of the static parameters including water saturation. However, based on the available PLT data, it is believed that these thin-bedded intervals generally contribute to the production from the wells and hence to the fluid flow in the reservoir. A new static and dynamic reservoir model of the GDA has been built that integrates and incorporates new seismic interpretation, petrophysical recharacterization, revised geological and reservoir engineering concepts, and eventually history matching to production data. A key component of this new model build has been integrated modelling iterations amongst different disciplines from new petrophysical interpretations through to dynamic simulation. Initial iterations used a conventional formation evaluation method and resulted in simulations that showed accelerated pressure drops (compared to production data) as a result of failure to capture flow from thin-beded intervals. An alternative petrophysical methodology that aims to better estimate water saturation within thin bedded intervals has been incorporated into a new workflow to account for the thin bed volumes. The new thin bed simulation model results in greater gas contributions from the thin-bedded intervals and helps overcome the historical shortage of static volumes required to achieve a pressure match.

ABSTRACT: Neonatal mortality is a recognized concern in cetaceans and, although infrequently documented, human intervention to provide neonatal care has been successful. Advancements in cetacean medical care now allow for enhanced neonatal care even with challenging circumstances. Herein, we describe neonatal care and hand-rearing of a male, 13 kg bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) calf that was immediately rejected and traumatized by the dam following an uncomplicated parturition. Immediate intervention and restraint allowed for examination, medical stabilization, wound care, parenteral treatments, and diagnostics. Colostrum and milk were collected from the dam under manual and voluntary restraint. The calf was fed a combination of the dam's milk and supplemental formula via a gastric tube, initially hourly with gradually decreasing frequency, for three months. Daily intensive care (e.g., blood sampling, topical wound care, and weights) was performed to monitor systemic health. The calf was originally housed alone but later was transitioned to a pool with visual and auditory access to other dolphins. When the calf reached 8 months of age, he was slowly introduced to another dam/calf pair. The calf is presently 4 years old and continues to thrive in a mixed social group of dam and calf pairs and young adult females comprised of two males and six females. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The primary objective of this study was to conduct an initial analysis of the proteome of exhaled breath condensate or blow in aquarium-based bottlenose dolphins {Tursiops truncatus) and, secondarily, to determine the commonality of proteins identified in blow with those in plasma of the same animals as recently documented. Exhaled breath condensate was collected from four young (2 to 6 y old), male dolphins using a 50-mL Falcon tube held above the blowhole for ten sequential exhalations; total volume ranged from 60 to 122 u,L. Subsequent to analysis of total protein, 20 jig of protein from each dolphin was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyaery 1 amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Of the four samples, three produced sufficient resolution of 15 bands that were excised from respective gels and subject to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and used for protein identification. Mass spectra data were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database restricted to all mammalian proteins. Based on proteins having > 2 peptides and present in at least two of the three dolphins, a total of 220 blow proteins were identified. While a majority (38 to 51%) of proteins could not be categorized, gene ontology indicated protein binding (26%), cytoplasm constituents (16%), and immune response (16%) dominated the molecular function, cellular component location, and biological process domains, respectively. From noncon-temporaneous samples, NCBI Accession numbers of 220 blow proteins described herein and 196 plasma proteins previously identified by LC-MS/ MS in the same dolphins were matched. Results indicated a commonality of 21 proteins (5%), with ten (48%) related to the immune system (e.g., complement- and immunoglobulin-related proteins) and the remainder to other various biological systems. Although preliminary, the novelty of these results provides additional support that exhaled breath condensate can be a relevant, less invasive alternative to blood collection to assess or monitor physiological health and pathological states. More specifically, the commonality of several immune-related proteins between the circulatory and respiratory systems provides a foundation for future investigations to determine the potential of these blow proteins as biomarkers that may be diagnostic or prognostic of respiratory health in bottlenose dolphins and, perhaps, other cetaceans. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Due to their worldwide distribution and occupancy of different types of environments, bottlenose dolphins display considerable morphological variation. Despite limited understanding about the taxonomic identity of such forms and connectivity among them at global scale, coastal (or inshore) and offshore (or oceanic) ecotypes have been widely recognized in several ocean regions. In the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA), however, there are scarce records of bottlenose dolphins differing in external morphology according to habitat preferences that resemble the coastal-offshore pattern observed elsewhere. The main aim of this study was to analyze the genetic variability, and test for population structure between coastal (n = 127) and offshore (n = 45) bottlenose dolphins sampled in the SWA to assess whether their external morphological distinction is consistent with genetic differentiation. We used a combination of mtDNA control region sequences and microsatellite genotypes to infer population structure and levels of genetic diversity. Our results from both molecular marker types were congruent and revealed strong levels of structuring (microsatellites FST = 0.385, p < .001; mtDNA FST = 0.183, p < .001; ΦST = 0.385, p < .001) and much lower genetic diversity in the coastal than the offshore ecotype, supporting patterns found in previous studies elsewhere. Despite the opportunity for gene flow in potential “contact zones”, we found minimal current and historical connectivity between ecotypes, suggesting they are following discrete evolutionary trajectories. Based on our molecular findings, which seem to be consistent with morphological differentiations recently described for bottlenose dolphins in our study area, we recommend recognizing the offshore bottlenose dolphin ecotype as an additional Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) in the SWA. Implications of these results for the conservation of bottlenose dolphins in SWA are also discussed. © 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to test the potential influence of short-term changes in water quality on the frequency of sightings of common dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. The study was based on two data sources: (1) Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatories (LOBOs) that provided real-time monitoring of multiple water quality and weather parameters, and (2) standardized methods for identifying and counting individual dolphins using photo-identification techniques. Water quality parameters included salinity, water color (chromophoric dissolved organic matter), conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, oxygen saturation, chlorophyll, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, temperature, and turbidity. Weather was assessed using data for air temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, light, and wind speed and direction. Variables were measured continuously over a one-year period and analyzed as the mean for each parameter the hour before, during, and after each dolphin sighting period. Short-term variations in sightings within 0.5 km of the LOBO were measured using previously established photo-identification techniques on a weekly basis. In multivariable regression analyses, statistically significant inverse associations were found between air temperature and the frequency of dolphin sightings for all three time periods. The results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating variation in weather and water chemistry data with dolphin movements as potential indicators of ecosystem quality and climate change. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: The amgdaloid complex consists of different nuclei, each with unique cytoarchitectonic, chemoarchitectonic and connectional characteristics. Most of the inputs coming from cortical and subcortical areas enter the amygdala via the lateral nucleus, which makes it the main receiving structure of the complex. The activity of its neurons is coordinated and modulated by different inhibitory, GABAergic-interneurons, which can be classified for their expression of various calcium-binding proteins, as well as by morphological characteristics. This research based on the analysis of the amygdala of three bottlenose dolphins, provides the first description of the topography, cytoarchitecture and distribution of calretinin immunoreactivity of the lateral nucleus. Our observations on the bottlenose dolphin confirmed the general topography of the mammalian amygdala and of the lateral nucleus. Notably, we identified six subdivision of the nucleus, more than those reported until now in the rat, monkey and human lateral nucleus. This could reveal an outstanding capability of integration and elaboration of external stimuli. In addition, we observed a strong presence of CR-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons and fibres. CR-ir neurons were mainly non-pyramidal inhibitory neurons; in particular, 80% of IR-cells were represented by large and small polygonal neurons. In the lateral nucleus of the human amygdala, CR-ir neurons form inhibitory synapses on calbindin-D28k-IR inhibitory interneurons. Since calbindin-D28k-ir interneurons make inhibitory synapses on the pyramidal cells, the final goal of the CR-ir interneurons could be the synchronization of cells activity, thus playing an important role in the control of information flow in the lateral amygdalar nucleus.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic communication is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon, crucial for social animals. We evaluate social sounds from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) of Laguna, southern Brazil, whose social structure is organized around a cooperative foraging tactic with artisanal fishermen. This tactic involves stereotyped and coordinated behaviour by dolphins and fishermen and is performed by a subset of the dolphin population, splitting it into two distinct social communities. We compared the acoustic parameters and type of whistles emitted by dolphins of the “non-cooperative” and “cooperative” communities, both during their interactions with fishermen and in times where dolphins were engaged in other types of foraging. Our findings show how dolphins’ social sounds differ between foraging tactics and social communities. The frequencies of six whistle types (ascending, descending, concave, convex, multiple, flat) were significantly dependent on tactics and communities. Ascending whistles were more common than expected during foraging without fishermen, and among dolphins of the non-cooperative community. Whistle acoustic parameters (duration, number of inclination changes and inflection points, and initial, final, maximum, minimum frequencies) also varied between social communities. In general, whistles emitted by cooperative dolphins, mainly when not interacting with fishermen, tended to be shorter, had higher frequency and more inflections than those emitted by non-cooperative dolphins. These results suggest that different whistles may convey specific information among dolphins related to foraging, which we hypothesize promote social cohesion among members of the same social community. These differences in acoustic repertoires add a new dimension of complexity to this unique human–animal interaction. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: The nasolacrimal duct (NLD) connects the orbital (often associated with the Deep Anterior Orbital gland: DAOG, a.k.a. Harderian gland) and nasal regions in many tetrapods. Adult cetaceans are usually said to lack an NLD, and there is little agreement in the literature concerning the identity of their orbital glands, which may reflect conflicting definitions rather than taxonomic variation. In this study, we examined an embryological series of the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), and report numerous divergences from other tetrapods. Underdeveloped eyelids and a few ventral orbital glands are present by late Stage (S) 17. By S 19, circumorbital conjunctival glands are present. In S 20, these conjunctival glands have proliferated, eyelids (and scattered palpebral glands) have formed, and a duct similar to the NLD has appeared. Subsequently, both the palpebral glands and the NLD are progressively reduced by S 22, even as the conjunctival glands exhibit regional growth. In most tetrapods examined, the ontogeny of the NLD follows a series of three stages: Inception of NLD, Connection of orbit and nasal cavity by the NLD and Ossification (i.e., formation of the bony canal surrounding the NLD, emerging into the orbit via the lacrimal foramen in the lacrimal bone). In contrast, the dolphin NLD originates at the same time as the lacrimal bone, and a lacrimal foramen fails to develop. The cetacean fossil record shows that a lacrimal foramen was present in the earliest ancestral amphibious, freshwater forms, but was soon lost as the lineage invaded the oceans.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean-fishery interactions are a recurring problem. These interactions are conflict prone, especially between fishers and those seeking marine mammal conservation. In the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, a large fleet of artisanal fisheries operates using a range of different techniques. We recorded 90 fishing operations in two different fishing areas of Veracruz, Mexico, between 2009-2010 and 2014-2015, assessing whether dolphin interaction negatively affects fish catch and fish gear. These potential impacts were evaluated using three generalized linear models (GLMs) hypothesizing that (1) depredation decreases catch per unit effort (CPUE), (2) the predator presence modifies catch composition, and (3) prey species presence increases the likelihood of depredation. Of the gillnet hauls analyzed, 27 were subject to depredation by bottlenose dolphins, despite conditions and fishing methods varying among sites. Higher CPUE attracts larger pods, but a negative effect by depredation was not detected. We also found that depredation probability increased when there were higher capture volumes, when mackerels and jacks were present, and when operations were most southwesterly. Despite the short distance (< 80 km) between sites, we found that bottlenose dolphins on each site displayed different feeding behaviors towards fishing nets. Regarding conservation, bycatch caused by dolphins does not seem to be problematic. In fact, the increase in boat traffic and declining prey abundances due to overfishing could be the main causes of fishers' economic loss. Dolphin-fishery interactions may not represent an actual challenge for marine conservation managers, but stakeholders, fisheries, and governmental institutions should be aware that diminishing returns due to overfishing could exacerbate the apparently false notion of dolphins competing for the fish. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Home range sizes have been determined for few odontocete populations, although the understanding of comparative trends in range utilization is important for conservation. Most of the published knowledge of the Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) of New Zealand, originates from one well- studied population around Banks Peninsula. Its ranging behavior has been described previously by a decades-long photo-identification (ID) study and by a shorter radio-telemetry study. Little is known, however, about how the dolphins utilize their home range in other coastal areas around the South Island of New Zealand. We used an intensive three-year photo-ID study to define the movement patterns of Hector's dolphins over diel and seasonal scales. Significant differences in the average movement behavior between the East Coast populations offKaikoura and Moeraki and the West Coast populations offWestport-Greymouth and in Jackson Bay are identified. Movement patterns optimizing range utilization in relation to prey abundance and accessibility are discussed. At the Kaikoura study area, the mean distances between consecutive sightings and speeds of dolphins were considerably reduced compared to other coastal areas. Therefore, the photo-ID study was extended offKaikoura to cover a total of 14 years. Those findings can be explained by the existence of an environmental barrier (i.e., the deep-water Kaikoura Canyon) that almost completely interrupts Hector's dolphin movements over the short distance of 15 km and very likely has led to a reduced genetic exchange. In conjunction with two recent studies, we present evidence of the impact of an environmental barrier on the population structure and foraging behavior of this shallow-water dolphin. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Encephalization, or brain expansion, underpins humans' sophisticated social cognition, including language, joint attention, shared goals, teaching, consensus decision-making and empathy. These abilities promote and stabilize cooperative social interactions, and have allowed us to create a 'cognitive' or 'cultural' niche and colonize almost every terrestrial ecosystem. Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) also have exceptionally large and anatomically sophisticated brains. Here, by evaluating a comprehensive database of brain size, social structures and cultural behaviours across cetacean species, we ask whether cetacean brains are similarly associated with a marine cultural niche. We show that cetacean encephalization is predicted by both social structure and by a quadratic relationship with group size. Moreover, brain size predicts the breadth of social and cultural behaviours, as well as ecological factors (diversity of prey types and to a lesser extent latitudinal range). The apparent coevolution of brains, social structure and behavioural richness of marine mammals provides a unique and striking parallel to the large brains and hyper-sociality of humans and other primates. Our results suggest that cetacean social cognition might similarly have arisen to provide the capacity to learn and use a diverse set of behavioural strategies in response to the challenges of social living. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although many countries prohibit whaling, it remains a significant cause of whale population decline. Whale meal, likely from whales killed during illegal whaling or caught accidentally, can appear in a fish meal as a contaminant detectable by microscopic examination of bone fragments. To provide a rigorous basis for such a detection, microscopic characterization of bone fragments of 10 female and 10 male, less than a year old to 21-year-old bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), a widespread cetacean species herein used as a whale model, was performed and compared to the reference bone fragments of fish, ruminants, poultry, and pigs. The processing of bones mimicked the process used in the production of meat and bone meals, while their description was based on qualitative characteristics (i.e., the shape of a bone fragment; the shape, density, and distribution of osteocyte lacunae; and the distribution and density of canaliculae). Bottlenose dolphin bone fragments are smoothly contoured. Their elliptical osteocyte lacunae are clearly visible, while the canaliculae radiate from the lacunae in all directions. The comparison of these qualitative bone characteristics with that of other vertebrata under study revealed that bottlenose dolphin bone fragments can definitely be differentiated from that of fish, may be differentiated from that of poultry and pig, but cannot be differentiated from that of ruminants. Measurements of the osteocyte lacunae showed the lacunar length to be strongly associated with an animal's age and lacunar shape, while their width was strongly associated with an animal's gender and lacunar shape. The results indicate the possibility of detecting a whale meal admixture in a fish meal using light microscopy, which should be followed by PCR to allow for the identification of the admixture source. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Two to four humpback dolphins were first time observed at two occasions on 3 February and 25 April 2016 on Turkish coastal waters of the Northeast Mediterranean. They were recorded by under-water cameras while feeding on fish escaping from experimental demersal trawl during two separate operations conducted on shallow waters. Although the quality of the footage was quite good, the individuals could only be identified at genus level. When the distribution ranges of the genus and recent enlargement of the Suez Channel are considered, the individuals are most likely of the strays of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea). © Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey.

ABSTRACT: The Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary was gazetted in 2005 to protect a resident population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) that lives in a heavily impacted urban environment. This study assesses the numbers and types of strandings before and after the creation of the sanctuary. Monitoring took place during 1987–2013, when 57 events were reported and 53 carcasses were examined by post-mortem. Events were assigned to a circumstance of death that combined post-mortem results and/or anecdotal information. The majority of records were Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (n = 47, 82%) but a few common dolphins (Delphinus delphis, n = 7, 12%) were also documented. Many (n = 19/46, 41%) of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were 1 year old or less. Strandings averaged 2.19 per annum for all dolphin species and 1.80 for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. When pre- (n = 20) and post-sanctuary (n = 27) data were compared for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, anthropogenic events decreased from 30% (n = 6/20) to 7% (n = 2/27) and no intentional (illegal) killings or entanglements were recorded after 2004. Unintentional anthropogenic mortalities were primarily boat collisions (n = 4 out of 5 cases). Disease was the most frequently recorded circumstance of death (n = 21) and although the number of cases increased after 2004, this may have been due to improved pathology investigations. Live strandings were rare during the study (n = 2). Despite a significant increase in overall dolphin mortalities pre- and post-sanctuary, the number of human-induced mortality events decreased significantly. Continued monitoring and post-mortems of carcasses is recommended for managing dolphins in the sanctuary. © 2018 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: To reveal the reproductive biology in male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), circulating gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) and testicular hormones (testosterone and inhibin) were monitored for 8−12 years in 2 captive bottlenose dolphins (Mars and Regulus). During the study period, Mars was undergoing sexual maturation, whereas Regulus was already mature at the beginning of the study. Assuming that Mars had reached sexual maturity when the significant increase in circulating testosterone levels was observed, serum concentration of inhibin was higher in the sexually immature stage than in the mature stage, whereas the serum concentration of FSH was higher in the sexually mature stage than in the immature stage. No difference was observed in the LH levels between preand post-sexual maturation. There was a significant increase in serum concentration of testosterone during spring in both animals. These results suggest that the mechanism responsible for regulating FSH secretion by inhibin functions during the sexually immature stage in this species. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviruses are nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, known to infect members of all tetrapod classes, with a similarity between phylogenies of hosts and viruses observed. We characterized bottlenose dolphin adenovirus 2 (BdAdV-2) found in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) with enteritis. Virions were seen by negative staining electron microscopy of feces. Initial sequences obtained using conserved PCR primers were expanded using primer walking techniques, and the complete coding sequence was obtained. Phylogenetic analyses were consistent with coevolution of this virus and its bottlenose dolphin host, placing BdAdV-2 into a monophyletic group with other mastadenoviruses of Cetartiodactyla. When considering the low guanine/cytosine (G/C) content of BdAdV-2 with the phylogenetic data, this virus may represent a host-jumping event from another member of Cetartiodactyla. Analysis of partial polymerase indicated that bottlenose dolphin adenovirus 1, previously identified in Spain, and BdAdV-2 are sister taxa with harbor porpoise adenovirus 1, forming a cetacean clade. Bottlenose dolphin adenovirus 2 includes a highly divergent fiber gene. Two genes homologous to the dUTPase superfamily are also present which could play a role in enabling viral replication in nondividing cells. We used sequence data to develop a probe hybridization quantitative PCR assay specific to BdAdV-2 with a limit of detection of 10 copies. © 2018, © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.

ABSTRACT: Dolphin cognitive abilities have been examined by establishing a concept-oriented cue, the innovate discriminative stimulus (S D ), wherein an individual is required to perform something new or different upon each stimulus given. Although a number of facilities have trained this behavior with a wide range of species, neither the training nor the level of creativity in response to this cue has been researched systematically. Moreover, differing criteria exist for whether novel or different behaviors should be defined as innovative as evidenced by the research to date. Ultimately, our goal is to establish a research and training protocol for using the innovateS D to assess the creative abilities in nonhuman species. We compared innovatetraining methodologies used with dolphins specifically, although a number of other species have been trained on this behavior based on anecdotal reports. Our literature review, including discussions with trainers, indicated that a number of potential pitfalls occur when training this cognitive task (e.g., avoid shaping a chained behavioral response). This methodological review provides both a clear definition of the criteria accepted for innovative behavior and a suggested approach for training and testing this concept in dolphins. Finally, the more unambiguously that we understand innovative behavior in a controlled setting, such as under stimulus control, the more we will be able to gain from studies of spontaneous behavior and other examples of behavioral innovation observed in the wild. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: As top predators, cetaceans occupy important ecologic niches in marine ecosystems, although this also makes them highly vulnerable to the biomagnification of persistent chemicals throughout their life stages. Coastal dolphins, in particular, are highly exposed to harmful chemicals in the marine environment, due to their proximity to anthropogenic activities. In this context, both Guiana (Sotalia guianensis) and Franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) have been used as valuable model species regarding the assessment of marine pollution along the South American coast. As these species are confined to a narrow coastal distribution and exhibit a small home range, they may be chronically exposed to chemical contaminants. In this chapter, an extensive compilation of relevant information on important chemical pollutants in both dolphin species is discussed, namely metals and certain persistent organic pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Moreover, the application of biomarkers of response is discussed, providing an enhanced comprehension on the use of this approach in investigating the effects of xenobiotics in both coastal species. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recent survey reports and observations from rivers in southern West Bengal (India) indicate the extirpation of Ganges River Dolphin (GRD) from the Indian Sundarbans. The present study undertaken during 2011-16 reviews the possible factors accountable for the disappearance of this obligatory freshwater cetacean from the major waterways of the Sundarbans, India and conclude that it is due to reasons of anthropogenic and geo-climatic origin. Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest on earth encompassing almost 10,000km2 of India and Bangladesh is located at the head of the Bay of Bengal within 21.533-22.666 0N and 88.083-89.850 0E, of which 62% lies within Bangladesh and 38% in India (Spalding et al. 2010). The landscape is a network of mudflats and islands at the deltaic mouth of the rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna created by accumulated sediments carried by the snow-fed Himalayan rivers and their tributaries along with anastomosing tidal water channels. Historic reports reveal the occurrence of GRD in the Sundarbans waters of both India and Bangladesh (Anderson 1879). Current data, however, confirms the disappearance of Platanista gangetica but there is continued occurrence of Orcaella brevirostris in the Indian part of the estuary. Analysis of causative factors in light of existing evidence validates the potential extirpation of Platanista from the majority of the Sundarbans in India, except for its persistence in only the westernmost segment in the lower reaches of river Hooghly as confirmed by this study. The present study also records the habitat preferences and limiting factors affecting GRD distribution, and maps the decline of its range. © Mitra & Chowdhury 2018.

ABSTRACT: The short-nosed Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) is the fifth largest member of Delphinidae, but is one of the least studied dolphin species. We studied the postnatal ontogeny and sexual dimorphism of the skull of Risso's dolphin by applying linear bivariate and multivariate analyses of allometry and discussing our findings in a comparative and functional framework. Comparing a representative of the Globicephalinae subfamily (a typically short-nosed group) with previously studied cetaceans belonging to different families is important for evaluating variations in the growth of splanchnocranium and neurocranium in cetaceans. Results of bivariate and multivariate approaches were mostly similar. The trophic apparatus showed positive allometry or isometry, whereas negative allometry was observed in neurochranial components and in width of external nares. We detected sexual dimorphism in the growth pattern of cranial variables related to trophic functions, suggesting slight differences in the mechanics of the trophic apparatus. Our results indicate a very low degree of sexual dimorphism in skull growth compared with other dolphins with most dimorphic growth rates favoring females; this result can be related to the earlier acquisition of an optimal performance in females, which is important for reproductive requirements. The growth of the splanchnocranium, and especially of those characters associated with the trophic function, exhibits a pattern of higher growth rate than neurochranial components, regardless of the short face of G. griseus. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

ABSTRACT: Sympatric species may exploit the same resources, potentially acting as competitors when resources are limited. For cetaceans, ecological separation between sympatric species is based on differences in diet and habitat use. The fransiscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei (Pontoporiidae) and the Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianesis (Delphinidae) live in sympatry along the southern and southeastern Brazilian coast, but Babitonga Bay is the only estuarine region in which these species occur throughout the year and live in direct sympatry. Twenty years of data on these populations give some indication of how this ecologically similar species share the same habitat. That coexistence is facilitated through differences in diet, distribution, and habitat use patterns. The Guiana dolphin is probably dominant in the niche partitioning system in Babitonga Bay. This fact, combined with small franciscana population size, makes the latter highly vulnerable to local extinction. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

ABSTRACT: We present results of the first simultaneous visual and acoustic surveys for Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), undertaken in Yarinacocha Lagoon, Ucayali, Peru (length = 20 km, area = 12 km2). A total of 324 Sotalia observations and 44 Inia observations were recorded in boat-based transects. Based upon total survey effort, we estimated Sotalia had a mean density ± SE of 1.98 ± 4.6 ind km-2and an overall abundance of 34 individuals (95% CI: 28 to 40). Average density for Inia was 0.2 ± 1.2 ind km-2with overall abundance estimated at 3 individuals (95% CI: 0 to 8). Visual surveys observed more Sotalia individuals during earlier hours of the day and during the dry season. Preliminary acoustic surveys undertaken with C-POD passive acoustic monitoring devices indicated a diel pattern in detections of cetacean vocalization with more diurnal activity and with detections ceasing from midnight until 10:00 AM. This work highlights the possibility of monitoring both river dolphin species through visual and acoustic surveys to generate baseline information on abundance trends and distribution patterns in the Ucayali region, an area with high levels of human disturbance. © 2017, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

ABSTRACT: A new algorithm for a compact mobile four-hydrophone array 'RAPID Array' that displays the dolphin's real-time direction data on a graphical user interface (GUI) was proposed to accurately estimate the number of Ganges river dolphins from acoustic data recorded during the census. By considering the trajectory changes in dolphins' click data depending on the time (t) and azimuth (θ) in the coordinate space (t: time, θ: azimuth) on the GUI, the concept of 'clustering' using the dolphins' direction data was introduced for developing the new algorithm. The proposed method could be applied using two modes: the online mode for real-time analysis at the observation site and offline mode for detailed analysis. Performance of the both online and offline modes of the developed algorithm using data from census conducted in 2015 and 2016 was clearly demonstrated. Periodic census using the RAPID Array with the proposed method will help in the behavioral analysis of Ganges river dolphins in their habitat in the Ganges river system. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.

ABSTRACT: We conducted a study to assess the populations of the two potentially endangered river dolphin species Inia geoffrensis and Sotalia fuviatilis in the river systems of the Río Tigre and the Río Marañon in the Peruvian Amazon region. Various observation methods were used and evaluated along ca. 353 kilometres of river and 134 to a maximum of 173 dolphins were recorded from 125 sightings and about 2000 photographs. Only about 10% of these dolphins could not be determined to species level, at least 57 individuals were identifed as S. fuviatilis, and 89 individuals as I. geoffrensis. The abundance of dolphins along the entire stretch was 0.13 individuals per km for S. fuviatilis and 0.25 individuals per km for I. geoffrensis. Each participant spent an average of 82 working hours on observation. Evaluation of methods used revealed that observation supported by photographic documentation (PSO) increases observation accuracy by 19%. PSO is thus regarded as an ideal method for future population assessments. Perspectives and potential fnancial costs for conservation of Amazonian dolphin populations are discussed. © 2018 Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background. A few odontocetes (echolocating toothed cetaceans) have been able to independently colonize freshwater ecosystems. Although some extant species of delphinids (true dolphins) and phocoenids (porpoises) at least occasionally migrate upstream of large river systems, they have close relatives in fully marine regions. This contrasts with the three odontocete families only containing extant species with a strictly freshwater habitat (Iniidae in South America, the recently extinct Lipotidae in China, and Platanistidae in southeast Asia). Among those, the fossil record of Iniidae includes taxa from freshwater deposits of South America, partly overlapping geographically with the extant Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis, whereas a few marine species from the Americas were only tentatively referred to the family, leaving the transition from a marine to freshwater environment poorly understood. Methods. Based on a partial odontocete skeleton including the cranium, discovered in late Miocene (Tortonian-Messinian) marine deposits near the estuary of the Cuanza River, Angola, we describe a new large iniid genus and species. The new taxon is compared to other extinct and extant iniids, and its phylogenetic relationships with the latter are investigated through cladistic analysis. Results and Discussion. The new genus and species Kwanzacetus khoisani shares a series of morphological features with Inia geoffrensis, including the combination of a frontal boss with nasals being lower on the anterior wall of the vertex, the laterally directed postorbital process of the frontal, the anteroposterior thickening of the nuchal crest, and robust teeth with wrinkled enamel. As confirmed (although with a low support) with the phylogenetic analysis, this makes the new taxon the closest relative of I. geoffrensis found in marine deposits. The geographic provenance of K. khoisani, on the eastern coast of South Atlantic, suggests that the transition from the marine environment to a freshwater, Amazonian habitat may have occurred on the Atlantic side of South America. This new record further increases the inioid diversity during the late Miocene, a time interval confirmed here as the heyday for this superfamily. Finally, this first description of a Neogene cetacean from inland deposits of western sub-Saharan Africa reveals the potential of this large coastal area for deciphering key steps of the evolutionary history of modern cetaceans in the South Atlantic.

ABSTRACT: A twelve-year hiatus in fishery-independent marine mammal surveys in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP), combined with a mandate to monitor dolphin stock status under international agreements and the need for reliable stock status information to set dolphin bycatch limits in the tuna purse-seine fishery, has renewed debate about how best to assess and monitor ETP dolphin stock status. The high cost of replicating previous ship-based surveys has intensified this debate. In this review, transect methods for estimating animal abundance from dedicated research surveys are considered, with a focus on both contemporary and potential methods suitable for surveying large areas for dolphin species that can form large, multi-species aggregations. Covered in this review are potential improvements to the previous ship-based survey methodology, other ship-based methods, alternative approaches based on high-resolution imagery and passive acoustics, and combinations of ship-based and alternative approaches. It is concluded that for immediate management needs, ship-based surveys, with some suggested modifications to improve precision, are the only reliable option despite their high cost. However, it is recommended that a top research priority should be development of composite methods. Pilot studies on the use of high-resolution imagery and passive acoustics for development of indices of relative abundance to be used in composite methods should be part of any future ship-based survey efforts. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Coastal and estuarine waters are important ecosystems with high primary and secondary productivity, but they are prone to the impacts of habitat loss caused by anthropogenic activities. For species exclusively inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, irreversible habitat loss can have dramatic implications for population viability. A Landsat image database was used to determine the extent of coastal changes along the northern Beibu Gulf, where a large humpback dolphin population is found. The results were compared with the standardized sighting gradient (SPUF) determined from a questionnaire survey of fishermen and likely core habitats identified by application of a global digital elevation model. Both SPUF and likely core habitat results indicated a continuous distribution of the humpback dolphin along the northern Beibu Gulf. Landsat images revealed that 129.6 km2 of coastal waters were permanently lost in the past 40 years, 60 km2 within the likely core habitats. Although this may be considered small, the impact of such habitat loss could be substantial in some local habitats. The humpback dolphin population in the northern Beibu Gulf should be regarded as one management unit, with two or more social subunits. Immediate systematic surveys are needed to fill information gaps on true distribution range and habitat-use patterns. Habitat protection actions for dolphins in the northern Beibu Gulf should include both core and linking habitats, including enacting protected areas in core habitats, mitigating anthropogenic impacts in likely habitats, restoring both coastal waters and surrounding landscape quality, effective treatment of industrial sewage discharge, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments for the planning of coastal development projects.

ABSTRACT: This study presents the first robust estimates of abundance and demographic parameters of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in a highly affected coastal ecosystem along the north-eastern Atlantic. Seasonal abundance, apparent survival and temporary emigration rates were estimated using Pollock's robust design models. Photographic identification data were collected from 2014 to 2016 along the north-western Iberian coast (Spain). Bottlenose dolphins were present year-round and with a high degree of occurrence in the study area, which is highly affected by human activity but is also a highly productive coastal ecosystem. Local abundance of bottlenose dolphins ranged from 56 in autumn 2014 to 144 in winter 2015. Apparent survival rate was high and constant, indicating no mortality and no permanent emigration. Temporal emigration rates varied seasonally and were lower from autumn to winter, suggesting that dolphins had a high probability of returning during the winter period. The observed changes in abundance and emigration rates most likely reflect seasonal fluctuations in abundance of prey species in this area. These results provide important baseline information in an area subject to significant anthropogenic pressures and for future comparisons with other populations of similar characteristics under the pressure of human activities, such as fisheries and aquaculture. © CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: George Emil Palade was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, with Albert Claude and Christian de Duve for cell fractions and the most important discovery: The ribosome, (corpuscula of Palade responsible for cellular proteins synthesis), mitochondria and reticulum endoplasmic. In 1975 Palade was elected Honorary member of the Romanian Academy. The scientific biography of Palade started in 1940 in Carol Davila Medical University with research of morphology and physiology of Dolphin Kidney. As a student G. E. Palade was fascinated by Professor Francisc Iosif Rainer (Anatomy and Anthropology), Andre Boivin (Biochemistry) and Gr. T. Popa. The doctoral thesis of G.E. Palade under the coordination of Fr. Rainer was about anatomical structure and physiology adaptation of dolphin kidney, the adaptation from terrestrial to sea life. The doctoral thesis of G. E. Palade remains unknown and outclassed by his research, considering “mile-stones” in cell biology. The dolphin kidney, dissected in 1939 by G. E. Palade, exists in the Anatomy Laboratory of Medical Faculty (Carol Davila University Bucharest). We present here his medical history which started with a research of macroscopic and microscopic structures of dolphin kidney, adaptation like member and affections of nephrons. Palade thesis confirmed his hypothesis and Rainer’s that dolphins descend from terrestrial mammal, although further adapted to the see life having short urinary tubs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

ABSTRACT: Risso's dolphin (Risso's; Grampus griseus) behavior is little described given their typical offshore distribution where research access is inherently challenging. We conducted focal group behavior follows of 51 Risso's groups from a circling, small, fixed-wing Partenavia aircraft in the Southern California Bight from 2008 through 2012 (15 aerial surveys; 72,647 km; 86 d). Instantaneous scan sampling of group heading and behavior state (rest/slow travel, medium-fast [mf] travel, and mill), and maximum nearest neighbor distance (MNND) estimated in adult body lengths (BLs) were noted once per 30 s. Focal follows occurred for 5 to 59 min (n = 51, mean 21.6, stan-dard deviation [SD] = 12.9). Mean group size was 25.8 (n = 51, SD ± 23.62, range 3 to 120). A total of 1,446 usable headings, 1,275 MNND, and 1,359 behavior state data points were used to calculate response variables of reorientation, splitting- joining, and behavior state transition rates relative to explanatory variables using standard multiple- linear-regression, logistic regression, or multi- nomial logistic regression models. Reorientation rates tended to be higher when other species were present. No explanatory variables were found to influence the splitting-joining rate. Risso's behavior state was significantly affected by calf presence and time of day. Risso's groups spent most (60%) time engaged in rest/slow travel followed by mf travel (33%) and milling (7%), and rarely changed behavior state. Transitions from one behavior state to another were more common in groups with calf presence, which were 4.3 times more likely to continue mf travel than non-calf groups. During early afternoon, Risso's were six times more likely to continue mf travel versus early morning and late afternoon. Preponderance of daytime rest/slow travel likely reflects pre-sumed need for diurnal rest prior to apparent noc- turnal foraging, a pattern associated with other nocturnal foraging dolphin species. Observations from aircraft facilitate a unique bird's eye view on social interactions and spacing of individuals, which are less available from the low-vantage perspective of other platforms. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Information on site fidelity and ranging patterns of wild animals is critical to understand how they use their environment and guide conservation and management strategies. Delphinids show a wide variety of site fidelity and ranging patterns. Between September 2013 and October 2015, we used boat-based surveys, photographic identification, biopsy sampling, clustering analysis, and geographic information systems to determine the site-fidelity patterns and representative ranges of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) inhabiting the inner area of Coffin Bay, a highly productive inverse estuary located within Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) of individuals’ site-fidelity index and sighting rates indicated that the majority of dolphins within the inner area of Coffin Bay are “regular residents” (n = 125), followed by “occasional residents” (n = 28), and “occasional visitors” (n = 26). The low standard distance deviation indicated that resident dolphins remained close to their main center of use (range = 0.7–4.7 km, X ± SD = 2.3 ± 0.9 km). Representative ranges of resident dolphins were small (range = 3.9–33.5 km2, X ± SD = 15.2 ± 6.8 km2), with no significant differences between males and females (Kruskal–Wallis, χ2 = 0.426, p =.808). The representative range of 56% of the resident dolphins was restricted to a particular bay within the study area. The strong site fidelity and restricted ranging patterns among individuals could be linked to the high population density of this species in the inner area of Coffin Bay, coupled with differences in social structure and feeding habits. Our results emphasize the importance of productive habitats as a major factor driving site fidelity and restricted movement patterns in highly mobile marine mammals and the high conservation value of the inner area of Coffin Bay for southern Australian bottlenose dolphins. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the coastal islands of southeastern Brazil is described based on video and photo-identification techniques conducted between 2004 and 2016. Annual and interannual occurrence patterns were determined through the sighting and resighting history of individually identified dolphins. A total of 32 dolphins were individually identified during the 98 surveys, with each animal being registered between one and 47 times. Site fidelity and residency were included as annual and interannual attributes, respectively. The Site Fidelity Index (SFI) ranged from 0.1 to 1.0. The SFI of the majority of the evaluated dolphins was classified as high (≥ 0.7) indicating strong site fidelity. Based on the residency criteria, 59.4% seasonal residents, 31.2% transients and 9.4% migrants and were assigned. The data support the hypothesis that this population is relatively stable, formed by the same animals of unknown origin with seasonal habits and high site fidelity and residency patterns, but with an apparent decline. These data reinforce the importance of the coastal islands off Rio de Janeiro as a critical habitat for the common bottlenose dolphins in southeastern Brazil and highlight the need for local conservation efforts to guarantee the maintenance of this possible small population unit. © 2018 Instituto de oceanografia.

ABSTRACT: Panama City, Florida is considered a notorious ‘hot spot’ in the southeastern United States for chronic illegal feeding and harassment of bottlenose dolphins. The nature and extent of these interactions was evaluated by Samuels and Bejder (2004); they concluded that food provisioning was the basis for human interactions with wild dolphins, and that these encounters were likely harmful to dolphins. A follow-up study was conducted in 2014 to reassess the current state of human interactions with wild dolphins. The number of conditioned dolphins (n = 21) tripled compared to the previous study. Both studies found conditioned dolphins engaged in human interaction events during approximately 75% of observable time points when vessels or swimmers were present. In this study, conditioned dolphins spent as much as 81% of their time begging or patrolling and significantly decreased their distance moved while doing so. Nested multinomial regression analysis revealed conditioned dolphins engaged in resting or foraging (i.e. natural) behaviour were extremely likely to switch to begging or patrolling (i.e. interaction) behaviours when vessels or swimmers were present. Numerous high risk situations were observed for both conditioned dolphins and humans during these interactions. The latest development in illegal feeding was documented: bait boats feeding dolphins to lure the animals into interactions with tour vessels and swimmers. Our observations indicate that the problem in Panama City has escalated: dolphins are being actively provisioned, often for long periods of time; the proportion of conditioned dolphins has increased; interacting dolphins and humans are both at increased risk for injury, illness, or death; and conditioned dolphin activity budgets and movement patterns continue to be negatively impacted by human behaviour. We recommend a more aggressive management strategy, such as targeted and sustained enforcement of existing regulations as well as additional restrictions that prohibit close approaches and in-water interactions for Panama City in order to curtail continued harassment of dolphins and reduce the risk of injury for both humans and dolphins. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: Description and functional interpretation of morphological variation in the dolphin column can be facilitated by recognizing structural units. This information offers important clues to the proportion of the column involved in the oscillation and displacement of the flukes, and how swimming style can vary among species. Thus, the morphological characterization and functional subdivision of the vertebral column is of key importance to gain insights into the locomotor performance of cetacean species occurring in different environments. We employed traditional morphometrics to establish the functional subdivision of the vertebral column of Commerson’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), a coastal species, and the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), a shelf species. These species are closely related, and some of them are partially sympatric. We also compared the obtained results against information previously reported by Marchesi et al (2017) on Peale’s dolphin (Lagenorhynchus australis), a coastal species, and the hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger), an oceanic species. These results bring further support to our hypothesis that coastal species have morphological traits associated with higher flexibility, whilst platform and oceanic species have features associated with higher stability in a greater proportion of their column. © SAREM, 2018.

ABSTRACT: Anecdotal information provided by local fishers is an invaluable tool in the study of marine mammal-fisheries interactions. This paper summarizes empirical and anecdotal information voluntarily provided by fishers during a survey monitoring the damage to coastal fisheries caused by dolphins. We visited 23 fishing harbours along the northern Aegean Sea coastline and monitored the fishing gear of 113 coastal fishers in order to identify the damage caused by dolphins. While we were monitoring the damage, the fishers voluntarily shared their general views on marine mammals and fisheries interactions, which were recorded and are presented here. The majority of fishers indicated that fishing gear, mesh size, depth and target species were important factors that determine depredation frequency and gear damage, whereas soaking time, time of day and season were not considered crucial. These findings provide useful insight in the study of dolphin-fishery interactions, especially for data-poor areas such as the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. The empirical knowledge of the fishers and their views is also important from an ethical perspective because, historically, dolphins in the Mediterranean had been culled and hunted for bounties for many years; even today, occasional deliberate dolphin killings are still recorded. Such information is required in the design of any management strategy that aims to minimize the conflicts with dolphins, thus preserving the fishers' livelihood. © The authors 2018.

ABSTRACT: Bottlenose dolphins along the northern Gulf of Mexico continue to be impacted by numerous stressors including harmful algal blooms, infectious disease epizootics, and oil exposure following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Studies to assess the potential impacts of the DWH oil spill on dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico were initiated as part of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment and included photographic-identification (photo ID) surveys to determine abundance, density, and site fidelity in St. Joseph Bay, Florida (SJB). Although significant oiling did not occur in SJB, long-term data have been collected in this region to provide insight into population-level trends in abundance/density over time. Thus, SJB dolphins could serve as a reference for comparison to other dolphin populations exposed to DWH oiling. During 2005–2007, the results of photo ID and telemetry surveys determined seasonal fluctuations in abundance and identified two different dolphin populations in SJB: residents sighted across multiple seasons and years (St. Joseph Bay Stock), and visitors that were present during the spring and fall and associated with a 2–3fold increase in abundance (Northern Coastal Stock). The goals for the current study were to compare dolphin abundance, density, and site fidelity, prior to (2005–2007), during (2010), and post-DWH (2011 and 2013) using photo-ID surveys and a spatially explicit robust-design capture-recapture (SERDCR) model. The data collected during and post-DWH paralleled previous research in that a low number of individuals with high site fidelity were sighted across seasons and years (St. Joseph Bay Stock), and abundance/density increased in the fall as a result of an influx of dolphins that were likely members of the Northern Coastal Stock. However, June and August 2010 abundance (347; 193–498, 95% CI and 394; 288–534, 95% CI, respectively), density (dolphins/km2) (2.60; 1.36–3.70, 95% CI and 2.55; 1.89–3.29, 95% CI, respectively), and site fidelity patterns were more similar to previous years’ spring and fall data, with high abundance estimates, increased dolphin density in coastal waters, and elevated numbers of individuals with low site fidelity in the SJB region. Factors that could have contributed to this increase in abundance include immigration of dolphins from adjacent estuaries, population growth within the St. Joseph Bay Stock, impacts from DWH oiling, and environmental and/or prey-based cues that influence movements of the Northern Coastal Stock. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring to assess impacts of current and future stressors on the dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

ABSTRACT: The Sotalia guianensis dolphin occurs in the western Atlantic Ocean, from the south of Brazil to Central America. It is a coastal species, much susceptible to human impacts, as anthropogenic noises, which in general causes potential impacts in marine mammals’ populations, because the emission and reception of sound signals plays a complex and vital role in this populations’ ecology through many different ways. This study reviews the acoustic repertoire and potential anthropic impacts on populations of Guiana dolphin (S. guianensis) through its occurrence, and described and compared the anthropogenic noises with the acoustic repertoire of three Brazilian populations: Cananéia estuary – São Paulo State, Caravelas estuary – Bahia State and Pipa beach – Rio Grande do Norte State. Data was collected similarly in these three sites during boats surveys using hydrophones and audio recorders. Results showed overlapping of the S. guianensis repertoire and noises produced from boats, dredge activities and wood-barges, leading to harm on individuals and populations. This review has gathered important information supporting marine activity management, and can be used to evaluate acoustic impacts over cetaceans population. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

ABSTRACT: This chapter focuses on tourist experience and economic benefits of the reef-adjoining dolphin watching industry in Lovina, Bali Indonesia in 2013. Tourist satisfaction was generally low, the tourists disliked the inconsiderate driving behaviours of the boatmen and satisfied tourists were more likely to rejoin the trip or recommend the trip to others. The industry’s total direct expenditures were ~USD 8.7 million p.a., with ~ USD 72,800 p.a. financial spill-over to the local snorkelling industry. Without the dolphins, Lovina might lose ~27% of the total direct expenditures (~11% to adjacent reef sites). Dolphin conservation, combined with local reef tourism, should be made priority to sustain local income in the future. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Bruce Prideaux and Anja Pabel; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: Delphinids produce large numbers of short duration, broadband echolocation clicks which may be useful for species classification in passive acoustic monitoring efforts. A challenge in echolocation click classification is to overcome the many sources of variability to recognize underlying patterns across many detections. An automated unsupervised network-based classification method was developed to simulate the approach a human analyst uses when categorizing click types: Clusters of similar clicks were identified by incorporating multiple click characteristics (spectral shape and inter-click interval distributions) to distinguish within-type from between-type variation, and identify distinct, persistent click types. Once click types were established, an algorithm for classifying novel detections using existing clusters was tested. The automated classification method was applied to a dataset of 52 million clicks detected across five monitoring sites over two years in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Seven distinct click types were identified, one of which is known to be associated with an acoustically identifiable delphinid (Risso’s dolphin) and six of which are not yet identified. All types occurred at multiple monitoring locations, but the relative occurrence of types varied, particularly between continental shelf and slope locations. Automatically-identified click types from autonomous seafloor recorders without verifiable species identification were compared with clicks detected on sea-surface towed hydrophone arrays in the presence of visually identified delphinid species. These comparisons suggest potential species identities for the animals producing some echolocation click types. The network-based classification method presented here is effective for rapid, unsupervised delphinid click classification across large datasets in which the click types may not be known a priori. © 2017 Public Library of Science.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of an animal's home range is a crucial component in making informed management decisions. However, many home range studies are limited by study area size, and therefore may underestimate the size of the home range. In many cases, individuals have been shown to travel outside of the study area and utilize a larger area than estimated by the study design. In this study, data collected by multiple research groups studying bottlenose dolphins on the east coast of Florida were combined to determine how home range estimates increased with increasing study area size. Home range analyses utilized photo-identification data collected from 6 study areas throughout the St Johns River (SJR; Jacksonville, FL, USA) and adjacent waterways, extending a total of 253km to the southern end of Mosquito Lagoon in the Indian River Lagoon Estuarine System. Univariate kernel density estimates (KDEs) were computed for individuals with 10 or more sightings (n=20). Kernels were calculated for the primary study area (SJR) first, then additional kernels were calculated by combining the SJR and the next adjacent waterway; this continued in an additive fashion until all study areas were included. The 95% and 50% KDEs calculated for the SJR alone ranged from 21 to 35 km and 4 to 19 km, respectively. The 95% and 50% KDEs calculated for all combined study areas ranged from 116 to 217km and 9 to 70 km, respectively. This study illustrates the degree to which home range may be underestimated by the use of limited study areas and demonstrates the benefits of conducting collaborative science. © The Author (2017).

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the influence of the most dominant factors (association patterns, gender, natal philopatry and anthropogenic pressure) on the home range size of the 44 most resident common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the waters of the Cres-Lošinj archipelago (north Adriatic Sea, Croatia), a recently declared NATURA 2000 SCI. Results show that variations in home range patterns (MCP, 95% KDE and 50% KDE home range size) among the individual resident dolphins are primarily related to differences in gender and reflect the way in which different genders respond to external stressors. In addition, results confirm the seasonal influence of nautical tourism on both female and male dolphins through changes in their home range sizes. The overall results improve current knowledge of the main anthropogenic threats that should be taken into consideration when developing conservation measures to be applied to this Cres and Lošinj SCI. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Predation risk has a profound influence on the behavior of marine mammals, affecting grouping patterns and habitat use. Dolphins frequently bear evidence of shark bites, which can provide an indirect measure of predation pressure. Using photo-identification data, we investigated the prevalence of shark bites on three sympatric species of inshore dolphin, the Australian snubfin (Orcaella heinsohni), Australian humpback (Sousa sahulensis), and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), among four study sites in northwestern Australia. Bite prevalence varied markedly between species, with 72% of snubfin, 46% of humpback, and 18% of bottlenose dolphins exhibiting evidence of shark bites. Binomial logistic regression confirmed a high likelihood of bite presence on snubfin dolphins, and at one particular site for snubfin and bottlenose dolphins. The prevalence of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) bites on snubfin dolphins was high, and bites attributed to other carcharhinid sharks were observed on all species. While acknowledging methodological differences with other studies, the prevalence of shark bites on snubfin dolphins is among the highest reported for any dolphins, suggesting predation risk represents an important but varying influence thereon. This study provides a baseline for future investigations into the affect of predation risk on the behavioral ecology of these sympatric species. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: Two dolphins carrying cameras swam in the ocean as they searched for and marked mine simulators – buried, proud or moored. As the animals swam ahead of a boat they searched the ocean. Cameras on their harness recorded continuous sound and video. Once a target was detected, the dolphins received a marker to take to the simulator’s location. During search and detection, dolphins made almost continuous trains of varying interval clicks. During the marking phase, shorter click trains were interrupted by periods of silence. As the dolphins marked simulators, they often produced victory squeals – pulse bursts that vary in duration, peak frequency and amplitude. Victory squeals were produced on 72% of marks. Sometimes after marking, or at other times during their long swims, the dolphins produced click packets. Packets typically consisted of two to 10 clicks with inter-click intervals of 7-117 ms followed by a silence of 223-983 ms. Click packets appeared unrelated with searching or marking. We suggest that the packets were used to improve signal to noise ratios for locating a boat or other distant object. Victory squeals produced when marking the targets suggest to us that the dolphins know when they have succeeded in this multipart task. © 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cetacean habitat use based on different environmental phases varies between species and geographies, and little is known about Pacific humpback dolphin habitat use in the Beibu Gulf. Here we aimed to identify seasonal, lunar and tidal influences on the spatial use of Beibu humpback dolphins based on two parameters: water depth and distance to an estuary. The ANOVA test indicated that habitat use was influenced by seasons and tidal phases, but not lunar phases. The humpback dolphins utilized shallow areas near an estuary throughout the wet season and high tides, and moved toward deeper water during the dry season and low tides. This habitat preference is likely synchronized with prey seasonal and tidal movements. The wet season and high tides bring abundant prey resources and increase accessibility to inshore shallow waters for humpback dolphins. The present study provides new information on regular habitat use by Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, which is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. © 2018 Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

ABSTRACT: Purse-seine vessels commonly interact with dolphins. The total number of dolphins accidentally killed in the world's purse-seine fisheries may be substantial, even if interaction rates are generally low. This paper describes an industry Code of Practice (CoP) that was established in Australian purse-seine fishery after an observer program detected high dolphin interaction rates that had not been reported in fishery logbooks. Key features of the CoP are search and delay procedures designed to prevent encirclements and release procedures that minimise mortalities. Extrapolation from observer data (3.9% of net sets observed), suggested that 449 dolphin encirclements and 423 mortalities occurred in 2004-05, the year before the CoP was established. A decade later, observer data suggest that annual encirclements and mortalities had been reduced by 87% and 97%, respectively. Searches were highly effective in detecting the presence of dolphins. Dolphins were not encircled in > 85% of net-sets made after searches determined that dolphins were absent from the fishing area. Opening the front of the net resulted in the successful release of all dolphins in > 86% of encirclement events. Discrepancies between interaction rates estimated from observer data and those recorded in logbooks have decreased over time. This study demonstrated that codes of practice that specify changes in fisher behaviour can be effective in mitigating the interactions of purse-seine fisheries with dolphins. The avoidance and release procedures documented in the CoP for the South Australian sardine fishery are simple and, if adopted in other purse-seine fisheries, could substantially reduce global mortality of dolphins. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Small-scale artisanal fisheries can have a significant negative impact in cetacean populations. Cetacean bycatch has been documented in the pole-and-line tuna fishery in the Azores with common dolphins being the species more frequently taken. Based on data collected by observers on ~50% of vessels operating from 1998 to 2012, we investigate the influence of various environmental and fisheries-related factors in common dolphin bycatch and calculate fleet-wide estimates of total bycatch using design-based and model-based methods. Over the 15-year study dolphin bycatch occurred in less than 0.4% of the observed fishing events. Generalized additive modelling results suggest a significant relationship between common dolphin bycatch and duration of fishing events, sea surface temperature and location. Total bycatch calculated from the traditional stratified ratio estimation approach was 196 (95% CI: 186-205), while the negative binomial GAM estimated 262 (95% CI: 249-274) dolphins. Bycatch estimates of common dolphin were similar using statistical approaches suggesting that either of these methods may be used in future bycatch assessments for this fishery. Our work shows that rates of common dolphin bycatch in the pole-and-line tuna fishery in the Azores are low, despite considerable variations between years. Dolphins caught were released alive although the fate of these individuals is unknown. Continued monitoring will provide a better understanding of dolphin bycatch and more accurate estimates essential in the development of potential mitigation measures. © 2018 Cruz et al.

ABSTRACT: A novel portable underwater acoustic modem is proposed in this paper for covert communication between divers or underwater unmanned vehicles (UUVs) and divers at a short distance. For the first time, real dolphin calls are used in the modem to realize biologically inspired Covert Underwater Acoustic Communication (CUAC). A variety of dolphin whistles and clicks stored in an SD card inside the modem helps to realize different biomimetic CUAC algorithms based on the specified covert scenario. In this paper, the information is conveyed during the time interval between dolphin clicks. TMS320C6748 and TLV320AIC3106 are the core processors used in our unique modem for fast digital processing and interconnection with other terminals or sensors. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the CUAC algorithm is less than 10‒5 when the signal to noise ratio is over –5 dB. The modem was tested in an underwater pool, and a data rate of 27.1 bits per second at a distance of 10 m was achieved. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the female reproductive parameters and population demographics of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, using long-term relational sightings and photographic databases. Data were collected between 2008 and 2016, during 654 boat-based surveys, from two dolphin-watching vessels and a research vessel. During 1018 sightings, 4231 identifications of 184 individual dolphins were recorded. The population size was charted through direct counts of known dolphins from 2011 to 2015 (mean 142, range 131–150), with 145 extant individuals in 2015: 80 adults, 25 juveniles, and 40 calves. Excluding dependent calves, 121 individuals were sighted, of whom 98% (n = 119) were sighted in multiple years, with 64% (n = 77) sighted in all 4 years (2012–2015). Between 2008 and 2016, 37 reproductive females and 69 dependent calves were recorded. Overall, 35% (n = 13) of these females were sighted with one calf, 43% (n = 16) with two calves and 22% (n = 8) with three calves. An average of seven (range 3–10) calves were born each year. Parturition peaked in July. Weaning ages ranged from 2.0 to 4.1 (mean 2.9) years. The mean inter-birth interval ranged between 2.7 ± 0.6 and 3.5 ± 1.3 years, depending on the method used. Mean annual calving rate was 0.29 young-of-year/reproductive female/year. Average crude birth rate was 0.07 ± 0.01. Fecundity was 0.26 ± 0.03. An average 11% of newborn calves were lost before age 1. These results are generally within the lower range of values reported for similar populations and provide essential data for conservation management and global bottlenose dolphin research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring health conditions is essential to detect early asymptomatic stages of a disease. To achieve this, blood, urine and breath samples are commonly used as a routine clinical diagnostic. These samples offer the opportunity to detect specific metabolites related to diseases and provide a better understanding of their development. Although blood samples are commonly used routinely to monitor health, the implementation of a relatively noninvasive technique, such as exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis, may further benefit the well-being of both humans and other animals. EBC analysis can be used to track possible physical or biochemical alterations caused by common diseases of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), such as infections or inflammatory-mediated processes. We have used an untargeted metabolomic method with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of EBC samples to determine biomarkers related to disease development. In this study, five dolphins under human care were followed up for 1 year. We collected paired blood, physical examination information, and EBC samples. We then statistically correlated this information to predict specific health alterations. Three dolphins provided promising case study information about biomarkers related to cutaneous infections, respiratory infections, dental disease, or hormonal changes (pregnancy). The use of complementary liquid chromatography platforms, with hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reverse-phased columns, allowed us to detect a wide spectrum of EBC biomarker compounds that could be related to these health alterations. Moreover, these two analytical techniques not only provided complementary metabolite information but in both cases they also provided promising diagnostic information for these health conditions.

ABSTRACT: Background. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used in many commercial products due to their excellent antibacterial ability. The AgNPs are released into the environment, gradually accumulate in the ocean, and may affect animals at high trophic levels, such as cetaceans and humans, via the food chain. Hence, the negative health impacts caused by AgNPs in cetaceans are of concern. Cytokines play a major role in the modulation of immune system and can be classified into two types: Th1 and Th2. Th1/Th2 balance can be evaluated by the ratios of their polarizing cytokines (i.e., interferon [IFN]-γ/Interleukin [IL]-4), and animals with imbalanced Th1/Th2 response may become more susceptible to certain kinds of infection. Therefore, the present study evaluated the in vitro cytokine responses of cetacean peripheral blood mononuclear cells (cPBMCs) to 20 nm citrate-AgNPs (C-AgNP20) by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Methods. Blood samples were collected from six captive common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The cPBMCs were isolated and utilized for evaluating the in vitro cytokine responses. The cytokines evaluated included IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The geometric means of two housekeeping genes (HKGs), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β2-microglobulin (B2M), of each sample were determined and used to Normalize the mRNA expression levels of target genes. Results. The ratio of late apoptotic/necrotic cells of cPBMCs significantly increased with or without concanavalin A (ConA) stimulation after 24 h of 10 µg/ml C-AgNP20 treatment. At 4 h of culture, the mRNA expression level of IL-10 was significantly decreased with 1 µg/ml C-AgNP20 treatment. At 24 h of culture with 1 µg/ml C-AgNP20, the mRNA expression levels of all cytokines were significantly decreased, with the exceptions of IL-4 and IL-10. The IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio was significantly decreased at 24 h of culture with 1 µg/ml C-AgNP20 treatment, and the IL-12/IL-4 ratio was significantly decreased at 4 or 24 h of culture with 0.1 or 1 µg/ml C-AgNP20 treatment, respectively. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of TNF-α was significantly decreased by 1 µg/ml C-AgNP20 after 24 h of culture. Discussion. The present study demonstrated that the sublethal dose of C-AgNP20 (≤1 µg/ml) had an inhibitory effect on the cytokine mRNA expression levels of cPBMCs with the evidence of Th2 cytokine bias and significantly decreased the mRNA expression level of TNF-α. Th2 cytokine bias is associated with enhanced immunity against parasites but decreased immunity to intracellular microorganisms. TNF-α is a contributing factor for the inflammatory response against the infection of intracellular pathogens. In summary, our data indicate that C-AgNP20 suppresses the cellular immune response and thereby increases the susceptibility of cetaceans to infection by intracellular microorganisms. © 2018 Li et al.

ABSTRACT: Rehabilitation efforts for live stranded marine mammals are guided by diagnostic measures of blood chemistry and hematology parameters obtained from each individual undergoing treatment. Despite the widespread use of blood parameters, reference values are not available in the literature from healthy rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) with which to infer the health status of an animal. We examined serum or plasma chemistry and hematology data from 17 rough-toothed dolphins either housed at Dolphin Quest French Polynesia or during their rehabilitation at the Dolphin and Whale Hospital in Sarasota, Florida, US between 1994 and 2005. Blood parameters were compared among healthy animals, rehabilitation animals that were eventually released, and rehabilitation animals that died. This study indicated significant differences in many blood parameters for the poorly known rough-toothed dolphin that are likely to vary between healthy and sick animals. These included aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, bicarbonate, and globulins, which were greater in sick dolphins, and alkaline phosphatase and total protein which were greater in healthy individuals. Total white blood cell counts were lower in healthy animals as were the absolute numbers of neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils. Analysis of first blood sample levels for glucose, sodium, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may have value for triage and prognostic evaluation. © 2018, © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.

ABSTRACT: Estuaries are biologically productive systems that support many cetacean populations and serve as important nursery grounds for their prey but face continued habitat degradation from increasing coastal development. Because estuaries are highly dynamic systems with fine-scale environmental gra-dients and microhabitats, it is challenging to identify foraging hotspots. To investigate whether bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) foraging hotspots occur at fine spatial (500 m) and temporal (time of day and season) scales in a large estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we conducted boat surveys from January to December 2001 in five subareas of Galveston Bay, totaling 3,815 km. Using geospatial techniques, we analyzed the number of dolphins, group behavior, and environmental variables (e.g., water temperature, salinity, turbidity, number of boats and seabirds, and distance to the Gulf) on a 500-m resolution grid. We observed 1,802 dolphins in 262 groups, 57% of which were foraging. Two subareas, Bolivar Roads and the Galveston Ship Channel, comprising only one-fifth of the total surveyed area, accounted for 91% of foraging groups. We identified six foraging hotspots in these two areas that were used through- out the day and in every season. Hotspots were located in deeper channels where dolphins often foraged with bottom trawl shrimp vessels, near ferry landings, and along the jetties where prey are likely exposed or aggregated by currents and tidal fronts. In addition, a greater number of seabirds and vessels were recorded in hotspots relative to where dolphins were not observed. We suggest that this fine spatio- temporal scale approach is a valuable tool for the conservation of vulnerable estuarine cetacean populations, particularly if paired with population and site-fidelity studies. Specifically, determining prime foraging habitat and identifying baseline hotspot density (number of foraging dolphins per unit area) provides useful metrics for detecting changes in Habitat usage resulting from habitat degradation or restoration efforts. © 2018 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Whale lice (Cyamidae) are ectoparasitic amphipods exclusive to cetaceans. Data on their epidemiology usually come from species infecting baleen whales, which are large, slow-moving hosts. In this study, we provide data on infection parameters, population structure and microhabitat selection in a whale louse exclusive to delphinids, Syncyamus aequus, with the aim of comparing them with those from cyamid species from large whales. A total of 176 striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba stranded along the Mediterranean coast of Spain during 1980–2016 were examined. The prevalence of S. aequus was 27.3% (95% CI: 20.9–34.3), and populations were sparse, with a mean number of whale lice per infected host of just 4.5 (3.4–6.7). The parasites were found on the head, with a clearly nested pattern, with the blowhole being the most frequently occupied site, followed by the mouth corner and eyes. Single-male or single-female populations were found on as much as 39.6% of infected dolphins. The sex ratio did not significantly depart from 1:1. Females were significantly larger than males and exhibited low fecundity (<10 eggs). The sex or the age class of the dolphins did not significantly affect the abundance or population structure of S. aequus. The patterns here obtained are in sharp contrast with those reported for whale lice infecting large whales. The small, streamlined body of dolphins creates strong current flows that would restrict the amount of suitable microhabitats and the body size of their associated cyamids. This would limit population growth, which in turn would lower the chances of host-to-host transmission upon body contacts, as well as male competition for the access to females. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: The stem odontocete Agorophius pygmaeus (Ashley Formation, lower Oligocene, South Carolina; 29.0–26.57 Ma) has been a critical point of comparison for studies of early neocete evolution owing to its early discovery as well as its transitional anatomy relative to archaeocete whales and modern odontocetes. Some time during the late nineteenth century the holotype skull went missing and has never been relocated; supplementary reference specimens have since been recently referred to the species from the Ashley Formation and the overlying Chandler Bridge Formation (upper Oligocene; 24.7–23.5). New crania referable to Agorophius sp. are identifiable to the genus based on several features of the intertemporal region. Furthermore, all published specimens from the Chandler Bridge Formation consistently share larger absolute size and a proportionally shorter exposure of the parietal in the skull roof than specimens from the Ashley Formation (including the holotype). Furthermore, these specimens include well-preserved ethmoid labyrinths and cribriform plates, indicating that Agorophius primitively retained a strong olfactory sense. These new crania suggest that at least two species of Agorophius are present in the Oligocene of South Carolina, revealing a somewhat more complicated taxonomic perspective.

ABSTRACT: Cetaceans are the only mammals to have evolved hyperphalangy, an increase in the number of phalanges beyond the mammalian plesiomorphic condition of three phalanges per digit. In this study, cetaceans were used as a novel model to review previous studies of mammalian hyperphalangy and contribute new experimental evidence as to the molecular origins of this phenotype in embryos of the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata). Results show embryos of dolphins, mice, and pigs share similar spatiotemporal patterns of signaling proteins known to shape limbs of mammals (e.g., FGF8, BMP2/4, WNT, GREM). However, fetal dolphins differ in that their interdigital tissues are retained, instead of undergoing apoptosis, and that multiple waves of interdigital signals likely contribute to the patterning of supernumerary joints and phalanges in adjacent digits. Integration of fossil and experimental evidence suggests that the presence of interdigital webbing within the fossils of semi-aquatic cetaceans, recovered from the Eocene Epoch (49Ma), was probably the result of BMP-antagonists counteracting interdigital apoptosis during embryonic limb development. Modifications to signals originating in these interdigital tissues likely contributed to the origin of an incipient form of hyperphalangy in obligatorily aquatic cetaceans about 35Ma. Finally, an extreme form of hyperphalangy, with six or more phalanges per digit, evolved independently in rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) and delphinids, and was probably associated with a wave of signaling within the interdigital tissues. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The research on imitation in the animal kingdom has more than a century-long history. A specific kind of imitation, auditory–vocal imitation, is well known in birds, especially among songbirds and parrots, but data for mammals are limited to elephants, marine mammals, and humans. Cetaceans are reported to imitate various signals, including species–specific calls, artificial sounds, and even vocalizations from other species if they share the same habitat. Here we describe the changes in the vocal repertoire of a beluga whale that was housed with a group of bottlenose dolphins. Two months after the beluga’s introduction into a new facility, we found that it began to imitate whistles of the dolphins, whereas one type of its own calls seemed to disappear. The case reported here may be considered as an interesting phenomenon of vocal accommodation to new social companions and cross-species socialization in cetaceans. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: In this article, a modified dolphin monitoring (MDM) operator is introduced and used to improve the performance of the colliding bodies optimization (CBO) algorithm for optimal design of steel structures (CBO-MDM). The performance of the CBO, enhanced colliding bodies optimization (ECBO) and CBO-MDM are compared through three well-established structural benchmarks. The optimized designs obtained by these algorithms are compared, and the results show that the performance of CBO-MDM is superior to those of the other two algorithms. The MDM is found to be a suitable tool to enhance the performance of the CBO algorithm. © 2017, Budapest University of Technology and Economics. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Mirror-self recognition (MSR) is a behavioral indicator of self-awareness in young children and only a few other species, including the great apes, dolphins, elephants and magpies. The emergence of self-awareness in children typically occurs during the second year and has been correlated with sensorimotor development and growing social and self-awareness. Comparative studies of MSR in chimpanzees report that the onset of this ability occurs between 2 years 4 months and 3 years 9 months of age. Studies of wild and captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have reported precocious sensorimotor and social awareness during the first weeks of life, but no comparative MSR research has been conducted with this species. We exposed two young bottlenose dolphins to an underwater mirror and analyzed video recordings of their behavioral responses over a 3-year period. Here we report that both dolphins exhibited MSR, indicated by self-directed behavior at the mirror, at ages earlier than generally reported for children and at ages much earlier than reported for chimpanzees. The early onset of MSR in young dolphins occurs in parallel with their advanced sensorimotor development, complex and reciprocal social interactions, and growing social awareness. Both dolphins passed subsequent mark tests at ages comparable with children. Thus, our findings indicate that dolphins exhibit self-awareness at a mirror at a younger age than previously reported for children or other species tested. © 2018 Morrison, Reiss.

ABSTRACT: Long-term studies often rely on natural markings for individual identification across time. The primary method for identification in small cetaceans relies on dorsal fin shape, scars, and other natural markings. However, dorsal fin markings can vary substantially over time and the dorsal fin can become unrecognizable after an encounter with a boat or shark. Although dorsal fins have the advantage in that they always break the water surface when the cetacean breathes, other physical features, such as body scars and pigmentation patterns can supplement. The goal of this study was to explore the use of dorso-lateral pigment patterns to identify wild bottlenose dolphins. We employed photographic pigment matching tests to determine if pigmentation patterns showed (1) longitudinal consistency and (2) bilateral symmetry using a 30 yr photographic database of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). We compared experienced dolphin researchers and inexperienced undergraduate student subjects in their ability to accurately match images. Both experienced and inexperienced subjects correctly matched dolphin individuals at a rate significantly above chance, even though they only had 10 s to make the match. These results demonstrate that pigment patterns can be used to reliably identify individual wild bottlenose dolphins, and likely other small cetacean species at other sites. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: The contents of the superfamily Platanistoidea, an early-diverging lineage comprising extinct species and a single extant representative of South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica), remain controversial. We describe here a partial skull and associated tympano-periotic bones identified as a new genus and species, Aondelphis talen gen. et sp. nov., collected in the lower levels of the Gaiman Formation (early Miocene), in Patagonia (Chubut Province, Argentina). Aondelphis is the first Patagonian platanistoid species named in almost a century. Phylogenetic analyses suggest Aondelphis talen gen. et sp. nov. and a taxon from New Zealand (cf. Papahu ZMT-73) are basal Platanistoidea sensu lato. Unambiguous synapomorphies related to the ear bones allowed us to determine its phylogenetic position. Aondelphis talen markedly differs from the other well-known early Miocene Patagonian platanistoid Notocetus, suggesting the coexistence of at least two different morphotypes that may have occupied different ecological niches at that time. The putative close relationship with a species from New Zealand indicates there was a rapid diversification and widespread distribution of the group in the Southern Hemisphere during the early Miocene. The description of new species and revision of historical records of Patagonian platanistoids can help shedding light on cetacean assemblages of the Patagonian sea during this epoch.

ABSTRACT: The present study summarizes information on the stranding common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, off the Sinop peninsula and also describes information on the weight-length relationships of the common dolphin in the center Black Sea, Turkey for the first time. During the research period, a total of 10 D. delphis were examined as stranding off Sinop Peninsula. It was determined that a lot of water birds species (Great cormorant) were seen as died on the sea coast during the dolphin survey. The death reasons of the common dolphin were drowned after the catching the nets and it is also suspected that death reason of common dolphins is water pollution. The length weight relationship (WLRs) of D. delphis determined as Log (W) = 2.2898 L-2.6501, r2 = 0.9959 (n = 7). It is important that standing levels of Cetaceans living in the Black Sea in terms of protection efforts. It is also important to investigate the causes of death. Focusing on these topics in subsequent studies will be important for the protection of endangered (Phocoena phocoena and Tursiops truncatus) and vulnerable (D. delphis) cetaceans in the Black Sea. © 2018, Centenary University.

ABSTRACT: Using opportunistic platforms to study humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) during their breeding season, from July to November, we analyzed the distribution of dolphin sightings in a poorly studied area, the north coast of Bahia State, Brazil. Between 2001 and 2006, more than 500 days of surveys were performed (2360 h of effort), in which 93 groups of dolphins were sighted from Itacaré (14° 53′S, 38° 15′W) to Subaúma (12° 30′S; 37° 63′W): 58 (62.4%) bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus; 21 (22.6%) estuarine dolphin, Sotalia guianensis; 7 (7.5%) -toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis; 3 (3.2%) Clymene’s Dolphin, Stenella clymene; 2 (2.1%) pygmy killer whale, Feresa attenuata; 1 (1.1%) melon-headed dolphin, Peponocephala electra and 1 (1.1%) Atlantic Spotted dolphin, Stenella frontalis. Group size and depth range were: 1–30 for T. truncatus (10–150 m); 1–35 for S. guianensis (4–60 m); 1–6 for S. bredanensis (27–45 m); 1–100 for S. clymene (42–121 m); 5–6 for F. attenuata (97–200 m); 2 for S. frontalis at 51 m and 20 for P. electra at 150 m. The more frequent sightings of Tursiops truncatus and Sotalia guianensis are probably related to their known distribution patterns in Brazilian coastal waters. The sightings reported to S. guianensis add new information in a previously unstudied area. The records of pelagic species such as Stenella clymene, Feresa attenuata and Peponocephala electra, can be related to the narrow continental shelf of the studied region. The sightings presented here confirm the occurrence of two additional species (F. attenuata and S. frontalis) in the Bahia state, and reveal the wide diversity of cetaceans in this area. This study is an initial step to document and collaborate with the knowledge about the dolphin species that occur in the shore of Bahia. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

ABSTRACT: We surveyed 13 carcasses of marine mammals (12 Trichechus manatus and one Stenella clymene) that had stranded in northeastern Brazil during 1990–2013 for infectious diseases by screening tissues from the collection of the Brazilian National Center of Research and Conservation of Aquatic Mammal, Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. Brucella spp. and Mycobacterium spp. were investigated by culturing and PCR of tissue samples, whereas Sarcocystidae parasites, Leptospira spp., and Morbillivirus were surveyed for using specific PCR assays. Brucella spp. and Mycobacterium spp. were not isolated through microbiologic culturing, and all animals were negative for detection of Sarcocystidae parasites, Leptospira spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Morbillivirus by PCR assays. All manatees were negative for Brucella spp. infection, but Brucella ceti was detected in the brain tissue of an S. clymene calf by using a PCR assay. © 2018, © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.

ABSTRACT: The Mediterranean subpopulation of common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is classified as endangered by the IUCN. Still, information about their diet in the Mediterranean is scarce. Stomach contents of 37 common dolphins stranded in the Alboran Sea and Strait of Gibraltar were analyzed. A total of 13,634 individual prey of 28 different taxa were identified. For fish, Myctophidae was the most important family as indicated by the highest index of relative importance (IRI = 8,470), followed by the family Sparidae (IRI = 609). The most important Myctophidae species was Madeira lantern fish (Ceratoscopelus maderensis) and for Sparids, the bogue (Boops boops). Cephalopods, instead, were found in low quantities only with 31 prey from the Loliginidae, Ommastrephidae, and Sepiolidae families. Overall, our results indicate that common dolphins are mainly piscivorous (99.77%N, 94.59%O, 99.73%W), feeding mostly on mesopelagic prey. Although common dolphins inhabit mainly coastal waters in the study area, the narrow continental shelf seems to facilitate the availability of Myctophids and other members of the mesopelagic assemblage to dolphins when the assemblage migrates to the surface at night. Our results represent the first attempt at quantifying the diet of this predator in the Alboran Sea and Strait of Gibraltar. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy

ABSTRACT: An improved understanding of interaction dynamics between dolphins and trawlers is essential for improving bycatch mitigation strategies. In-situ observations using video at increasing distances from the net opening during 50 commercial fish trawls, recorded 5908 common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821)) interactions and provided details on their duration, depredation rates, and behaviours. Dolphin interactions with trawls were very common (98% of day-trawls, 118 ± 16 interactions per trawl), with durations and prey consumption positively correlated with the distances ventured into the net. Acoustic deterrents (pingers) had no effect on interaction numbers or durations. Based on in-situ observations, the factors that contribute toward dolphin bycatch in demersal fish trawls were likely associated with (i) risky dolphin behaviour (i.e., entering net during hauling, residing deep within trawl for extended periods or social aggression) and (or) (ii) instability of fishing gear resulting in entrapment. Given the high level of dolphin attendance during most day-trawls, mitigation strategies that focus on improving and monitoring the stability of trawl gear would be more effective than current acoustic deterrent devices aimed at modifying dolphin behaviour. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.
